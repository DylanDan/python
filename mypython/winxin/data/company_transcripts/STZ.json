At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, the call will be opened for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions].", "I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Patty Yahn-Urlaub", "Thank you, Laurie. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter fiscal 2018 conference call. I am here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Klein, our Chief Financial Officer.", "As a reminder reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measures and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com.", "Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call.", "With regard to unregistered security offerings discussed during the call, please note that the securities subject to those offerings have not been registered under the Security Act of 1933 and may not be offered or sold in the U.S. absent registration or an available exemption from registration requirements.", "Before turning the call over to Rob, I would like to ask that we limit each Q&A session participant to one question, which will help us to end our call on schedule. Thanks, in advance and now, here is Rob.", "Rob Sands", "Thank you, Patty and good morning everyone. Before we get started with our quarterly review, I would like to convey my sincere sympathy to all who have been affected by the string of recent natural disasters and tragedies. Thankfully the earthquakes in Mexico did not have an impact on our production operations there, but our sympathies to all of our affected families.", "So now, let's get started with our discussion of Constellation's second quarter fiscal 2018 sales and earnings results. We delivered exceptional results for the second quarter of our fiscal year. Throughout the business, we gained share overall, improved margins, continued to generate strong free cash flow, and executed exceptionally well both operationally and end market. These results are a testament to the fact that our total beverage alcohol or TBA strategy is paying-off. We remained a leader in the high-end of the U.S. beer market, and we are reaping the benefits of our wine and spirits premiumization strategy. ", "As a matter of fact, our beer business which remains the number one growth driver in the high end of the U.S. beer market generated more than 60% of the growth of this market segment during the quarter. ", "Overall Constellation has been the clear winner during the 120 days of summer for the past four years growing dollar share of the total beer market more than any other leading supplier. ", "Excellent execution during the July 4 holiday, the most important holiday for the U.S. beer industry, drove significant market share gains for the quarter. During this timeframe, Constellation had five brands in the top $20 share gainers, including Modelo Especial and Corona Extra in the number two and number three positions, as well as Pacifico, Modelo Negra, Modelo Chelada, and Tamarindo Picante for example. ", "Record level distribution gains and increased media activities continued to drive greater than 60% of our overall depletion growth. Across the portfolio, you can see excellent results of these efforts. ", "Additional TV advertising and digital support propelled Corona Extra, which was recently named by InterBrand as one of the best global brands of 2017 for the eighth year in a row. The Corona can format grew more than 20% during the quarter, with the launch of its limited edition, Beach in a Can packaging. And Corona Extra was the official beer sponsor of the Mayweather versus McGregor fight, which set the new record for the largest viewing boxing audience.", "Modelo Especial increased TV advertising and promotional investments beginning with the NBA finals in early June, and was also named the official beer of two prominent soccer tournaments, including the Gold Cup, all of which led to the games in trial and awareness versus a year ago. And Modelo Chelada Especial was recently named 2017 Nielson Breakthrough Innovation Award Winner. ", "These activities drove depletion growth of almost 20% for the Modelo Especial family of brands for the quarter. Pacifico continues to capture new consumers by building brand awareness and trial across the brand\u2019s priority geographies. During the quarter, Pacifico TV advertising aired across the Western U.S., Colorado and Texas. ", "Now this activity was complemented by year round social media support on both Facebook and Instagram. In addition, the Summer X Games chose Pacifico as their exclusive beer partner for their competition in July. ", "As we head into the second half of the year, the beer portfolio is well positioned from a marketing and promotional perspective, supporting the professional and college football season, as well as key boxing and soccer sponsorships. Our innovation test markets for Corona Premier and Corona Familiar continue to be very successful. As a result we plan to nationally launch Premier beginning in fiscal 2019, with Familiar rolling out to all major Hispanic markets, a key demographic for this brand during the same time frame.", "I\u2019d like to remind everyone that the benefits of these new product introductions have already been included in the growth goals that we have outlined at our New York City Investor Day last November. During the quarter, we added Funky Buddha Brewery to our newly established Craft and Specialty Beer business. Florida based Funky Buddha is a regional craft beer player and South Florida's largest craft microbrewery by size and volume.", "The acquisition of Funky Buddha is a continuation of our beer strategy to be the leader in the high-end of the U.S. beer market. This brand has great potential and plenty of runway for future growth and we plan to leverage that potential to begin building a stronger presence in the high-end craft beer as this market segment continues to be one of the key growth drivers within the U.S. beer market.", "Our goal is to continue to grow distribution of the brand throughout the State of Florida, as well as targeted expansions into key new states. From an operations perspective, our capital expansion projects in Mexico continues to be on track on all fronts. The Nava Brewery achieved record production volumes during the second quarter and we look forward to completing the next phase of expansion taking the brewery to 27.5 million hectoliters of capacity by calendar year-end. ", "Glass Furnace number 3 is now fully operational and ramping to peak efficiency levels. The Obregon Brewery continues to perform at very high utilization levels, and we are currently optimizing existing capacity as we plan to increase capacity in both brewing and packaging before the end of the fiscal year.", "Construction continues in Mexicali and we are making solid progress. Brewhouse tank fabrication and installation are currently in process; and building structures for brewing, packaging, and utilities are well underway. Overall, the strong results that the beer business achieved in second quarter are driving the upward revision in our EPS guidance for the year. David will have more to say in this regard in a few moments.", "Now turning to our wine and spirits business, during the second quarter, we gained momentum for our wine business gaining market share and delivering strong depletion growth of 5%. And while we continue to improve margins for this business, the significant margin enhancement that we saw in the first quarter from positive mix and a divestiture of the Canadian business were somewhat offset by planned investments in marketing primarily for our focused brands as well as promotional activity as shipments and depletions became aligned through the first half of the year.", "These investments are obviously paying off as we posted depletion growth of more than 12% for our focused brands during the quarter driven by Black Box, Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Kim Crawford, Meiomi, Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi, and SWEDKA Vodka. And within our focused brand portfolio, our top five profit contributors are collectively growing volume 10% with profits also growing double-digits year-to-date.", "As we head into our key selling season for the wine and spirits business, we have solid programming in place and are well positioned to develop our goals for the year. Planned investments including Black Box Digital Advertising, the launch of a new TV campaign for Kim Crawford beginning this fall, as well as the continuation of Woodbridge TV and digital advertising to increase awareness and fuel momentum for this brand. In addition, the new first ever national digital advertising program for Meiomi will continue leading up to the holidays.", "Now from an innovation perspective, the 7 Moons Red Blend Wine brand is gaining momentum and has already become a top 10 premium Red Blend. And our recent Rose line extensions have taken off including Meiomi, Kim Crawford and Black Box Rose brands. Our acquired wine and spirits brands are performing exceptionally well, including High West Whiskey and Casa Noble tequila, as well as the Prisoner, Meiomi and Charles Smith Wine Brands.", "On a year-to-date basis, through the first half, these brands collectively delivered depletion growth of 23% with a gross margin in the 60% range. And following the recent Schrader acquisition Constellation has become a top $100 plus Cabernet Sauvignon wine producer. ", "Our spirits portfolio posted net sales growth of 2% for the quarter, driven primarily by High West Whiskey. In addition, SVEDKA Vodka gained market share of the vodka category due impart to the successful launch of the new SVEDKA Blue Roseberry flavor.", "Now in closing, I am pleased with our second quarter results and what we have accomplished in the first half of the year. The total beverage alcohol portfolio remains strong. As many of our high-end beer and premium wine and spirits brands gain share. It is these products that remain growth drivers within the TBA category, which is expected to continue in the future.", "In addition, our portfolio performance and execution by our commercial and operational teams continues to drive margin benefits, giving us the confidence to raise our guidance for the year.", "With that I would now like to turn the call over to David, who will review our financial results for the second quarter. ", "David Klein", "Thanks, Rob and good morning, everyone. I hope everyone saw our new press release format and found it helpful. We decided to provide the financial press, analyst and investors with our financial results, accomplishments and strategic initiatives in a more concise and easy to use format. Our Q2 results demonstrated continued strong financial performance as we generated 8% organic net sales growth, expanded our consolidated comparable basis operating margin by 340 basis points and increased comparable basis EBIT by 14%.", "These results include particularly strong operational performance by our beer business, which along with anticipated favorability in our tax rate is driving an increase in our full year comparable basis diluted EPS goal to a range of $8.25 to $8.40 per share. We believe the recent natural disasters had a minor impact on our Q2 results and may have some minimal impact on Q3 results, which we factored into our new guidance. However, we continue to monitor the situation in these affected areas.", "Let's look at Q2 performance and our full year outlook in more detail where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. For beer, net sales increased 13% on volume growth of 12%. Depletion growth came in at 8% as we won the 4th of July holiday and the rest of the key summer selling season. We overlapped a difficult 14% depletion growth comparison for Q2 fiscal \u201817. Shipment growth ran ahead of depletion growth after we saw the opposite trend in Q1.", "For the first half of the year shipment and depletion growth rates are both in the 9% to 10% range, this has us on track to meet our net sales goal for fiscal \u201818 as we continue to expect net sales growth to be in the 9% to 11% range. This includes 1% to 2% of pricing targeted for our Mexican portfolio.", "Beer operating margin increased 420 basis points to 41.1%, primarily due to lower COGS, favorable pricing and foreign currency benefits. The lower COGS reflect benefits from supply independence from ABI and glass sourcing as we saw strong operational performance at our breweries and glass plant during the peak summer production period. Our Nave Brewery generated record production volume and performed ahead of our expectations for the quarter. These benefits were partially offset by a $13 million increase in depreciation expense, which totaled $40 million for Q2. ", "Given the strong operational performance, we now expect beer operating income growth to be in the range of 17% to 19%. The expected moderation in beer operating income growth and margin for the back half of the year versus the first half of the year is being primarily driven by lower production volume due to normal seasonality, combined with the continued ramp up in depreciation and line commissioning costs including headcount additions to support our expanding operating platform. ", "In addition SG&A leverage is impacted by the lower volumes that occur in the second half of the year, as a result of the seasonality of the business. Last quarter, we indicated that we expected an unfavorable foreign currency impact due to tougher peso comparisons in the back half of fiscal \u201818. However this headwind has been mitigated through our hedging program and we currently expect an unfavorable currency impact to be fairly minimal.", "For wine and spirits, we saw a strong Q2 U.S. depletion growth of 5%, which outpaced U.S. shipment volume, primarily due to timing, as we reported shipments ahead of depletions in Q1. This contributed to Q2 organic net sales being down 1% as favorable mix was more than offset by lower volume. Promotional expense was higher in Q2 than Q1 due impart to the increase in depletions we saw in Q2 versus Q1.", "At the half way mark of fiscal \u201818, organic net sales are up 2% and U.S. depletions are also up 2%, while operating margin increased 330 basis points, driving operating income growth of 5%.", "For the quarter, wine and spirits operating margin increased 40 basis points to 26.2%. This improvement primarily reflects the divestiture of the lower margin Canadian wine business and favorable mix, partially offset by higher marketing investments.", "For fiscal \u201818, we continue to expect wine and spirits reported net sales to decrease in the range of 4% to 6% and operating income to be flat. These projections include the negative impact of the Canadian wine business divestiture and the estimated incremental benefits from the High West, Charles Smith, and Prisoner acquisitions. ", "When excluding the impact of the Canadian wine business divestiture from our fiscal \u201817 wine and spirits results, we continue to expect net sales growth of 4% to 6% and operating income growth of 5% to 7%. The moderation of our wine and spirits operating growth in the back half of fiscal \u201818 implied by our guidance is being driven primarily by Q3 activities, including planned marketing and SG&A investments during the key holiday season and loss of $17 million of operating income from the Canadian wine business, which was recognized in Q3 last year.", "As a result of these factors, we are targeting and wine and spirits operating income to be down in the low to mid-teens range for Q3 fiscal \u201818 on a reported basis. I\u2019d also like to note, that as part of our premiumization efforts, we have been rationalizing lower margin, value brand SKUs. These actions are expected to impact wine and spirits revenue growth by almost 100 basis points for fiscal \u201818, while improving operating margin and ROIC.", "Interest expense decreased 14% as the benefit of lower average interest rates was partially offset by higher average debt balances. We now expect fiscal year \u201818 interest expense to be in the range of $330 million to $340 million. The improvement is primarily related to short-term interest rates, trending more favorable than our earlier projections. ", "We recently announced plans to launch a Commercial Paper Program to improve short-term borrowing costs, which is typical for investment grade companies. The program is expected to be an unregistered private placement and provide for the issuance of up to $1 billion of commercial paper. The program is expected to be supported with available commitments under our revolving credit facility, so it will not result in an increase in the total amount of our authorized debt. ", "When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt at the end of August totaled $8.8 billion, a $230 million decrease from our net debt balance at the end of fiscal 2017. Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio moved down to 3.3 times at the end of August from 3.7 times at the end of fiscal '17, while we continue to invest in our Mexican operations, build our portfolio and return cash to shareholders with $201 million worth of dividends paid and $14 million of stock repurchases during the first half of the year.", "Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 20.5% versus 31.8% last year. This improvement reflects the benefit of reinvesting foreign earnings under APB 23 and the adoption of ASU 2016-09, which requires excess tax benefits from stock based payment awards to be recognized in the income statement. ", "For fiscal '18 we now expect the effective tax rate to approximate 21% versus our previous guidance of 22%. The lower projected rate is primarily due to an increase in forecasted excess tax benefits from stock based payment awards and lower effective tax rates on the foreign earnings of our beer business. We expect our Q3 tax rate to be higher than our full year tax rate and Q4 to be in line with that full year rate.", "I would also like to note for fiscal '18 we continue to expect weighted average diluted shares outstanding to approximately 201 million shares and net income attributable to non-controlling interest is now expected to approximate $10 million to $15 million versus our prior estimate of about $10 million. As mentioned earlier, we're now projecting our full year comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $8.25 to $8.40. The midpoint of this guidance has us targeting 23% growth. Our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments which are detailed in the release. ", "Moving to free cash flow, which we defined as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated $598 million of free cash flow for the first half of fiscal '18 versus $676 million for the same period last year. As operating cash flow growth was more than offset by an increase in CapEx.", "We continue to expect fiscal '18 free cash flow to be in the range of $725 million to $825 million. We did not revise our free cash flow as the benefit from our projected earnings increase is expected to be offset by unfavorable timing of recoverable value added taxes. Our free cash flow guidance reflects operating cash flow in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion and CapEx of $1.175 billion to $1.275 billion, including approximately $1 billion of CapEx targeted for our Mexico beer operations expansion.", "In closing, our beer business continues to deliver impressive operational and marketplace execution, while generating top tier sales and profit growth. And our portfolio premiumization efforts continue to enhance the financial profile of our wine and spirits business. ", "With that Rob and I are happy to take your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session ", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. ", "Dara Mohsenian", "Hey, good morning guys. ", "Rob Sands", "Hey, Dara. ", "Dara Mohsenian", "So first just a detail question. David you indicated hedging offsets a lot of the peso FX margin impact in beer this fiscal year. I'm just wondering if you can quantify if we stayed at current spot rates, can you give us a sense for how much of a drag FX will be to beer margins in fiscal '19?", "And then the real question is Rob, I was hoping you could flush out a bit more detail on Corona Premier success in test markets. It looks pretty solid at around 3% of sales in the test markets and tracked channels. So just any details around the magnitude of traction for the brand in test markets, the cannibalization that you're seeing on the rest of the portfolio, and then any expectations around the national launch next fiscal year. Thanks.", "David Klein", "So Dara, on the first part the current effective FX rate, so kind of net of our hedges on a year-to-date basis is probably in that mid-18s range. So to the extent that current spot\u2019s a little lower than that, it would be a bit of a drag next year, but not much.", "Dara Mohsenian", "Okay. ", "Rob Sands", "Yes, so as it relates to Premier, the test markets have been very successful. What do we mean by successful, what we are looking at is pretty much things like velocity per point of distribution, which for a new product, Premier\u2019s velocity per point of distribution was high. And the other thing that we are looking at which is in actuality a relatively minor concern is cannibalization, which actually turned out to be significantly lower than we expected. ", "Now I\u2019d say that cannibalization is a relatively minor concern and that\u2019s cannibalization of our own products because there is no margin difference between Corona Premier and the other products, so cannibalization isn\u2019t really an issue as long as one plus one equals three. And right now I would say that it\u2019s looking definitively like one plus one will equal three, because given our market shares versus the rest of the market, if cannibalization is the right term, we\u2019re really taking share from competitors not to a large degree from ourselves, which makes logical sense.", "So, looks good. ", "Dara Mohsenian", "Okay, great. Thanks. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. ", "Rob Sands", "Hey Bryan. ", "Bryan Spillane", "Hi, good morning everyone. My question was around advertising. Can you give us a sense David, sort of specifically in beer what type of increase you\u2019ve had in advertising and promotion this year? And then, I guess some color on still are you getting the immediate lift, when you are adding more marketing and advertising in the market, and I think that was the case last year. So just trying to get a sense if you are putting more into the market and if you are still getting that good sort of immediate lift off your advertising?", "David Klein", "Yes, so, it was still -- we are still running in general in that 8.5% to 9% range. Clearly, that means the dollars are up because of the growth of our business. And just kind of as a note, we will see as a percentage of net sales higher marketing spend in Q3, simply because of the lower sales quarter and we spend money with the NFL property. So again we\u2019re spending about the same percentage as we have in the past.", "And yet we continue to see really impressive returns on our marketing spend in our beer business, which I think is tribute to the quality of the advertising that our marketing team puts in place, as well as the power of the brands. But we monitor that return on an ongoing basis, and we\u2019re going to continue to invest in our brands in our beer business, and you\u2019re going to see us begin to invest more in our brands in our wine business, which will also see a fairly large increase on a percentage of net sales basis in Q3 versus where we have been in the past. ", "Bryan Spillane", "Okay, thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo. ", "Adam Scott", "Hi, good morning. It\u2019s actually Adam Scott on line for Bonnie. Question on the wine and spirits business, obviously really great performance in Focus brands with depletions up 12%, but the implied growth of non-Focus brands was almost down 6%. So I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the strategy behind these brands and maybe whether at some point it might make sense to divest them or perhaps to reinvigorate them, since they are such a drag. So if you could just touch on that, that\u2019d be great. Thanks.", "Rob Sands", "Yes, so what you just suggested is not at all unusual in that. Our Focus brands constitutes the vast majority of our sales and profit, it\u2019s almost like a perfect Pareto principle type situation, which almost every company exhibits. In that, a relatively small number of our brands, i.e., our Focus brands which are about 17 or so brands constitutes about 70%, 80% of our profits. And yes, so therefore the rest of the portfolio does represent what we might call tail brands or perhaps more euphemistically technical brands. ", "The interesting thing in the wine and spirits business is regardless of the growth rate, every brand is profitable and a contributor, therefore to our overall profits. And therefore it makes economic sense to keep them when you look at what the potential value would be to a third party from a discounted cash flow basis versus the value to ourselves. So, that\u2019s why we don\u2019t divest the tail. We also don\u2019t spend a lot of time on it from an operational, marketing, or activity point of view. ", "Now that said, we have divested lower margin, lower growth tail businesses and brands in the past, where it makes economic sense to do so in the manner that I just described meaning taking a look at what the NPV of the future cash flows of those businesses are compared to what we think that we can sell that for. Canada is a good example of that, a number of years ago, we sold off our value wine business Almaden and Inglenook. We sold of our value spirits business as an example brands like Barton and Crystal Palace, and Mr. Boston and so on and so forth.", "So we are always evaluating that, but I have given you basically the method under, which we evaluate that and generally speaking the brands that are in our portfolio now are worth more to us than they would be to a third party and that\u2019s why we keep up. And they are profitable and therefore they help fuel the investments that we make in the focus brands.", "David Klein", "Yes, just one other thing to add to that, Adam, as I said in my script that we have been doing some SKU rationalization, which creates about or create about 100 basis points drag on growth. Nut that\u2019s just good business where we can discontinue a SKU that has a like low 30 margins and replace it with a SKU that has 50% or 60% margins using the same assets.", "Adam Scott", "Great, thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI.", "Robert Ottenstein", "Great, thank you very much. Terrific quarter and very nice press release, well done, I like the new format. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit -- I understand for the year your shipments and depletions are in line, I am wondering if you could talk a little bit about the quarter specifically, why there was such a large difference. Our sense was that they were going to come in close, did that have to do with some year-end slowdown in business or a lot of extra shelf space. So just trying to get a sense specifically for the quarter, why the big difference please?", "David Klein", "So you are talking about beer Robert?", "Robert Ottenstein", "Yes, yes, beer shipments and depletions please.", "David Klein", "Yes, so from -- so when we look at it from a growth rate perspective, what -- I guess so in the first quarter of the year, sorry I am just backing up here. So in the first quarter of the year, we -- you're referencing the fact that we depleted more than we shipped. So we were able to recover in the second quarter, and I would say that we probably did a little bit better job in the recovery than we may have expected thanks to some amazing performance by our operations we\u2019re able to ship a little bit more beer than we would have expected, bringing our distributor inventory days back in line where we would like them to be.", "Robert Ottenstein", "Okay. So your brewery operations ran more efficiently than you thought they would, so you were able to ship more is that the answer?", "David Klein", "That's the majority of the answer. And yes, it's not even the efficiency the level of utilization at our breweries was quite high. And again some amazing work by our teams in Mexico.", "Robert Ottenstein", "Terrific. Congratulations and thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Nicolaus.", "Mark Swartzberg ", "Yes, thank you and good morning everyone. Rob and David too, I'm confused why you haven't committed to repo. And the reason I say that is we heard you in November say, we've clarified our leverage objective, it's now 3.5 and we're now sitting at kind of 3.2, 3.3 levels. And there is no comment on repo and the cash flow is going to continue to come. So what's going on and as far as your priorities from an M&A perspective, is it fair to think spirits is your highest priority if you have to consider the comparative share you have there versus your other two businesses?", "David Klein", "So I'll comment on the repurchase component and I'll let Rob comment on M&A. Our capital allocation philosophy Mark hasn't changed at all. So we said when we were below 3.5 times we would look to buyback our dilution on a systematic basis and more than our dilution say opportunistically. And remember, we\u2019ve repurchased $1.2 billion worth of stock towards the tail-end of last fiscal year.", "So we waited in Q2 until we got below 3.5 times and then we started with our systematic repurchase of our dilution granted it only amounted to $14 million in the quarter. But that's more of a timing issue than anything else. So we remain committed to our capital allocation principles.", "Mark Swartzberg ", "And then maybe there is a nuance I missed. But is 3.5 the objective or are you willing to go lower than that?", "David Klein", "So we're going to continue to operate the business kind of targeting 3.5. Now that said, I'm not sure we'll be dogmatic to stay exactly at 3.5, but we will stay in that 3.5 times range over a medium term period of time.", "Mark Swartzberg ", "Got it, okay. ", "Rob Sands", "And what was your question on M&A Mark?", "Mark Swartzberg ", "Well spirits comparatively high priority versus beer in terms of the size of the assets you might purchase the spirits comparatively higher priority than the other two alcohol businesses.", "Rob Sands", "Not necessarily. We continue to look across all three categories. So fundamentally, you could see tuck-in acquisitions across beer, wine and spirits. And I'd say we're fairly agnostic relative to the three categories it's more a question of growth and margins and what is -- what we think is opportunistic. So there is good examples across all three categories of tuck-in acquisitions if they were available that would meet the growth and margin and economic criteria that we have.", "So I wouldn't in any way see performance expect to see from us either just spirits or just beer, just wine I think you\u2019re going to see more of the same kind of the thing that you've seen in the past. So we bought High West, we bought Casa Noble, we bought Charles Smith, we brought Funky Buddha. I mean, so it's been a mix it will continue to be a mix.", "Mark Swartzberg ", "Great, thank you.", "David Klein", "By the way Mark, if the question also relates to by not staying at 3.5 times are we in some way loading up for something, the answer is no, it just we're going to be around that 3.5 times range and we do intend to buy our stock back as well as invest in our business as well as do M&A.", "Mark Swartzberg ", "Super, I'm glad you so that that exactly what I was trying to get clarity on. Thank you gentlemen.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of Macquarie. ", "Caroline Levy ", "Good morning and again my congratulations and I think you just set the gold standard in press releases. In terms of the -- I was just wonder if you could help us understand this growth in beer, if you took your biggest brands Corona and Modelo, could you quantify perhaps how much of their growth is distribution gains and how much I mean how happy are you with the trends in velocities at existing point of distribution?", "David Klein", "Yes, so from a distribution standpoint, we've said that about 60% of our growth has come from distribution gains and in fact the beer sales team has done an outstanding job of executing against their distribution objectives for the year and now we're seeing a bit of an acceleration of our distribution growth across the portfolio. So, a majority of it is based upon the growth in distribution in the business.", "Rob Sands", "And then to the second part of your question we're entirely unhappy and disappointed with our distribution growth because we don't have the distribution that we ought to have as a company meaning in beer and given the growth and margins to the retailer of our portfolio. So, the good news in that is we're making progress, but there is a lot of room left to go in distribution, which basically means there is a big growth runway ahead of us.", "Caroline Levy ", "Thank you. Just on the velocities, is Corona significantly higher than Modelo or visa-versa?", "Rob Sands", "Yes, velocity?", "Caroline Levy ", "Yes.", "Rob Sands", "Yes, Corona would have a higher velocity than Modelo, I believe, we'll double check that.", "David Klein ", "Yes, I don't have the individual brand velocities with me.", "Rob Sands", "I don't either.", "Caroline Levy ", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.", "Judy Hong ", "Thank you, good morning. ", "David Klein ", "Hey, Judy.", "Judy Hong ", "So, just, I guess couple of quick questions related to your guidance. So, when I kind of think about your depletion outlook for the balance of the year, I think it implies sort of stable growth versus what you've seen the first half of the year. The comparisons are little bit easier, you had talked about maybe a minor impact from the hurricanes, you've got the Premier launch in kind of the beginning of next year. Just so trying to get a little bit more of an understanding where the upside versus kind of the downside case in terms of depletion guidance.", "And then David, just in terms of the margin for the back half for beer, obviously it does employ I think something like a 36% EBIT margin. So, kind of the delta between first half versus the second half, is it mostly attributable to really the lower volume related to the seasonality of the business?", "David Klein ", "Yes, so I'll take the second one first. So, if you look at the seasonality of the business and use the last couple years of as an example, we sell about 55% to 60% of our total years beer in the first half of the year. And I think if you look at our fixed cost in our business plus from an operation standpoint plus thinking of SG&A as roughly fixed across the year and you kind of apply the seasonality against that you get a pretty reasonable drag in the back half of the year and we think that's going to be the normal seasonal cycle going forward.", "In addition to that this year we do have work going on at Nava and at Obregon that will result in line commissioning cost and incremental labor coming on to support the expansion. And then of course we have the continued addition of depreciation as we put assets into service. So, I think we'll when we get through this year we'll be able to outline a better seasonality model, but that's what we're expecting.", "And then in terms of depletions, we\u2019re -- I would say that we\u2019re pretty balanced in terms of where our guidance is because we have a -- we do have an easier overlap in particular in Q4 from a depletion standpoint with beer. At the same time we\u2019re sitting here at just over 8% depletions in Q2. So, we think that we\u2019re pretty balanced in terms of deplete forecast if you will.", "Judy Hong", "Got it. Okay, thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Credit Suisse.", "Laurent Grandet", "Good morning everyone. I have got one follow-up from the question from Caroline about the beer segment. So could you please update us on the commercial approach to gain shelf space from slow moving competitive brands specifically craft beer and light beer? How I mean are you assessing your progress on these?", "And then the second one, as you are one of the best if not the best commercial -- beer commercial organization in the U.S. besides M&A could we envisage you to import or to distribute the beer from Europe or Japan to leverage better your assets in the U.S. Thank you. ", "Rob Sands", "Yes, so first on shelf space. Our increases in distribution are specifically coming from the kind of thing that you mentioned either shelf space coming from slower moving craft SKUs or slower moving domestic. As we increase our shelf space, because the overall beer shelf space I wouldn\u2019t say at this stage is growing. So, I mean that is precisely the trust and the concept and our discussion with retailers is that they can improve their growth rate and their profitability per unit shelf space by devoting more shelf space to our growth portfolio and high margin portfolio than either low margin domestic beer, or craft that is not moving.", "And then on your second question, imports other than our own, I would say at the moment don\u2019t [inaudible] are not very exciting to us for a couple reasons. Number one, if you look at imports as a category in the United States, I would say the vast majority if not almost all of the growth in imports with a small exception of a couple of small brands is coming from our portfolio.", "So, it\u2019s a little bit of a misnomer to think that the growth in the beer category to the extent that there is any is coming from imports, it is not, it is coming from Constellations portfolio of Mexican beers. And then there is also growth coming from the craft segment and that\u2019s about it.", "And then number two, we\u2019re uninterested, completely uninterested in taking on imports of other companies at an agency basis, in fact we gave up those imports. So we used to have brands like Ching-Dao in the portfolio and St. Pauli Girl and those were agency brands. Now the margins on that kind of business are not consistent with the kind of businesses and the kind of business that we\u2019re interested in, point number one. And then point number two, there isn\u2019t really much growth in imports from any country except Mexico and that\u2019s all coming from our portfolio and of course there is like one or two small exceptions to what I am saying. But they literally are one or two small exception. ", "So, hopefully that answers your question. ", "Laurent Grandet ", "Yes very clear. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research Group.", "Tim Ramey", "Thanks so much, good morning and congrats on a great performance again. Rob you\u2019ve made a great case for incremental distributions and phasings in the beer segment. And it was couple of years back that we did the big distributor realignment in wine and I think the 5% depletion growth in wine in this quarter and particularly the strong growth rates in the focus brands. It leaves me to ask the question do you have the ability to kind of ask -- under this total beverage alcohol discussion do you have the ability to go to retailers and say we\u2019re not getting fair share phasings in wine or make that case to your distribution. How do you think about that?", "Rob Sands", "Well, I mean the answer to that is yes, especially in when you look at our focus brands and some of our most key brands, I mean the -- what you are describing and I know you know this is sort of the essence of what we call sales execution. But okay, in wine and spirits, it\u2019s slightly different than beer, although very slightly, because what I am about to say really applies all three categories. But in wine and spirits in particular because of the -- and really wine in particular because of the very, very high degree of fragmentation versus beer for argument sake.", "The total key is merchandising and when we talk about merchandising it\u2019s all about getting the product on the floor and advertised by the retailer with some kind of a deal, that\u2019s really the key to execution in really wine and spirits a little less so in beer where it\u2019s about getting more of that shelf, which continues to be dominated by really just a couple of companies that represent the vast majority of the market share in beer in the country, but have declining portfolios. ", "That said, merchandising in beer is important too, getting the floor is also important but now in wine a wine bottle on a shelf is one wine bottle and one label amongst 1,000. ", "Q - Tim Ramey", "Yes. ", "Rob Sands", "And so, if you really want to have your product in danger of being purchased right, there is no better way than having a display of your product on the floor in front of the cash register and in the stores add with a discount so that consumers can easily pickup a bottle of it as they checkout at the cash register. So as I said that is the essence -- it\u2019s the essence of sales execution.", "Tim Ramey", "So would you argue that the point of leverage is with the retailer with a discussion on total beverage alcohols, or is it I need to go back to blocking and tackling with the distributor?", "Rob Sands", "I would say that it\u2019s both, but as far as TBA goes, total beverage alcohol, I think it\u2019s a retail story. And what I mean by that is that there is a number of facts that are extremely important that the retailer needs to understand and really probably doesn\u2019t understand and there is two facts. And I think it if you were back to school, Bill Newlands our COO and David talked about this.", "A very large percentage of consumers right now are shopping across all three categories at once. So they are buying wine, beer and spirits, I think the number is something like 55% of consumers are shopping and drinking across all three categories, which is far different than it used to be years ago.", "And so we need to address those consumers\u2019 desires and we would do that at retail by offering our TBA portfolio of premium and growing brands, that\u2019s point number to the retailer. Point number two to the retailer is almost even a more important point and that is that if a retail basket contains all three beverage alcohol products meaning beer, wine and spirits, the total value of the ring will be larger by several hundred percent than a basket that only has one category in it of the three or even two categories in it of the three.", "So, that's what retail is all about and the most successful retailers in the country are all about how do we increase the average size of the ring i.e., the basket as the shopper leaves the store and there probably is no better way to do that than to get the consumer to purchase all three categories. Because if I do that that consumer is going to be a very big purchaser in that store.", "Tim Ramey", "Perfect, thanks so much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust.", "Bill Chappell", "Thanks and good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on Funky Buddha and just kind of the decision on that and based on kind of the learnings some Ballast Point, how might that be different, how does that lead to maybe looking at other type acquisitions I mean you had kind of taken a break from Ballast Point to this. And so just trying to understand how this might be different in terms of your thought process after having Ballast Point for couple of years?", "Rob Sands", "Yes, that's an interesting question. And there is some very significant learnings relative to that and what we are doing with Ballast Point relates to that and how we're treating Funky Buddha also relates to that. So, I would say that when the craft beer business as a general proposition was growing at a much faster rate, the modus operandi that most craft businesses had including Ballast Point before we bought it and for a period of time after we bought it was create a whole bunch of products, throw them out, try to throw them out there everywhere and anywhere you can and see what happens and let the consumer decide.", "As the business has slowed down, as there is a SKU contraction going on that modus operandi really doesn't work anymore because what you found is that just putting the product out everywhere and anywhere around the country in stores that may not have a very high what we call CDI category development index, doesn't make a lot of sense because the stuff just sits on the shelf that gets old and now consumers are sort of realizing that.", "So, what we've done with Ballast Point is number one we're consolidating the distribution network into our gold network, that's a very important learning and very important to us Funky Buddha if and when we expanded outside of Florida that will be a key tenant number one. Number two, focusing on key SKU that are really driving the growth as oppose to overly fragmenting the portfolio and then driving or marketing against those key SKUs, marketing and promotion. Where we know that there is velocity and consumer interest that's another key learning as oppose to just putting out 50 different things. So driving this usually two or three or four key SKUs that are important.", "And then the third element, which is really important is not expanding geographically too quick and therefore into markets where there is no consumer awareness of the brand there is really no marketing just throwing the product out there to retailers. Because it will just sit there and won\u2019t be reordered and that's where you sort of see a bit of a slowdown. And a lot of these companies is that they are cycling through having throwing a lot out there and then finding out that it's not repeat business.", "So, number one with Funky Buddha, we get the beauty of being able to apply those tenants straight off the bat and therefore I would say building a stronger more consistent and more measured growth story with Ballast Point we\u2019re retreating to that approach and philosophy a bit and hence that\u2019s why you see some of the shorter term negative impact in Ballast Point, which I would say that as we move into our next fiscal, you will see us cycle that. And we\u2019re pretty hopeful that our activities there will take hold, because we have moved it to our gold network, they are extremely highly motivated to drive the brand, the liquids are award winning and fantastic.", "So there is nothing fundamentally wrong with it other than the approach that was previously taken was not I\u2019d say the kind of professional approach that we as a major company could really bring to it. So we\u2019re in that process right now and those are new learnings from our Ballast Point experience. So more to come.", "Bill Chappell", "Thanks so much, I appreciate it. ", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Tom Coleman of Kentico [ph].", "Rob Sands", "Hey, Tom. ", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hey guys, how are you doing? Great job, I got a question, no one has asked it, very important question. How did you guys know to stick with the New York Jet\u2019s Corona Red Zone promotion? Who figured that out, that they were going to be two in two after four weeks?", "Rob Sands", "It\u2019s pure [indiscernible]. We\u2019re not going to go into gambling, because we probably all be arrested Tom. ", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good job, good job. ", "Rob Sands", "Because of these forward knowledge that we have of these matters.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Exactly alright, well fantastic quarter, hope to see you guys soon. ", "Rob Sands", "Thank you. ", "David Klein", "Thanks Tom. ", "Operator", "Thank you, I will now return the call to Rob Sands, for any additional or closing remarks.", "Rob Sands", "Okay, as we close out the discussion for our second quarter results, I want to thank everyone, everyone who contributed to the strong performance of our business for the first half of the year. Though the year is far from complete, our new guidance reflects the confidence we have in our ability to sustain our growth momentum in the second half. ", "Our next quarterly call is scheduled for early January, when we will share the results of our third quarter. Until then we wish you all a safe and happy holiday season, certainly in our business this time of the year is great. And it\u2019s a great opportunity to responsibly share Constellation\u2019s fine beer, wine and spirits products with friends and family.", "So thanks again everybody for joining our call and have a great day.", "Operator", "Thank you for participating in the Constellation Brands second quarter 2018 earnings conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Patty Yahn-Urlaub", "Thank you, Paula. Good morning everyone and welcome to Constellation\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal year-end 2015 conference call. I\u2019m here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer.", "This call complements our news releases which have also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable, organic and constant-currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company\u2019s Web site at www.cbrands.com.", "Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call.

Before I begin the review of our accomplishments for the year and our plans for fiscal 2016, I would like to focus your attention on the press release issued earlier today reporting that our board of directors has approved the initiation of a quarterly common stock cash dividend for the first time in the history of our company.", "This milestone is of particular significance because it reflects the confidence that we and our board of directors have in our ability to execute against growth opportunities, invest in our businesses and generate free cash flow that could be returned to you, our shareholders. It is the collective strength of our businesses that has abled this action and demonstrated by the impressive results achieved by the company in fiscal 2015.", "Since the acquisition of our beer business almost two years ago, we have had no shortage of milestones. We emerged as the number one multi-category player in alcoholic beverages and we are committing significant investment to our world class brewery in Mexico and our key [ph] beer brands continue to achieve outstanding growth and garner accolades for their quality. For example, six of our wine and spirits brands and three of our beer brands won Impact's Hot Brands award for 2014 as announced in early March.", "Collectively, these accomplishments have driven the appreciation of our stock which remains one of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index. So now let's talk about some of our key achievements for fiscal 2015 and the great initiatives we have underway as we charge ahead to an exciting fiscal 2016.", "This past summer, we purchased Casa Noble Tequila, an award winning handcrafted super-premium tequila, which has been a great addition to our portfolio. This fast growing tequila brand naturally complements our Mexican beer brands and fits well into our existing wine and spirits distribution infrastructure. More recently, we hired our new Chief Growth Officer, Bill Newlands, who is responsible for providing greater focus and coordination on the long-term growth opportunities across our beer and wine and spirits businesses.", "In addition, Bill is accountable for accelerating innovation and new product development initiatives and leveraging strategic insights and customer analytics while identifying synergies across total beverage alcohol within our national accounts organizations. Bill reports directly to me and I am happy that he has joined our executive management team. One of our major accomplishments for the year was the implementation of a multifaceted long-term, glass strategy for our beer business under favorable terms with key industry players, which included the formation of a 50:50 joint venture with Owens-Illinois, the world's leading glass container producer to own, operate, and expand the Nava glass plant.", "The acquisition by the joint venture of ABI's state-of-the-art glass plant located adjacent to our brewery in Mexico and the execution of a glass supply agreement with Mexican glass manufacturer, Vitro, the benefits of which we will begin to fully realize once their Monterrey glass plant has been completed. We believe this comprehensive sourcing strategy provides an optimal solution for this essential component of our beer production process, while securing future supply of materials and approved margins on finished products.", "Now the commercial side of our business continued to achieve stellar growth in fiscal 2015, outperforming the U.S. beer industry key competitors and all other imports for the fifth consecutive year with growth achieved by every brand in our Mexican beer portfolio. As a result, Constellation Brands\u2019 beer business was the number one contributor to growth in the U.S. beer category in fiscal 2015, while delivering market share growth across all channels in 48 out of 50 states. More importantly, our beer business growth has accelerated every year since 2010 and depletion trends accelerating to greater than 8% in fiscal 2015.", "I would like to take a minute to share some of this past year's amazing accomplishments for our iconic beer brands and highlight the key initiatives we plan to execute during fiscal 2016 in order to maintain this excellent momentum for the business. Let's begin with the clear heavyweights in our portfolio, Corona Extra and Modelo Especial. These brands are not only the biggest but have contributed the greatest incremental volume growth. Our flagship Corona Extra brand is the best selling imported beer in the United States. This brand sold more than 105 million cases in fiscal 2015 and posted depletion growth of more than 3% for the year. Corona Extra was the only top five beer brands in the U.S. to achieve growth last year with volume trends for this brand continuing to maintain their solid momentum.", "In fiscal 2016, we expect to capitalize on the growth of Corona Extra through increased national TV advertising, sports media, boxing sponsorships, and by leveraging our acquisition of Casa Noble. According to GuestMetrics, during calendar 2014, Corona Extra continues to be the number one selling imported beer in the off-premise channel. To further support Corona Extra, we plan to increase our investment to expand activations in on premise accounts throughout the year. Most importantly, fiscal 2016 will represent the year of the can for Corona Extra. We see great opportunity for growth with cans, as this format currently represents less than 3% of total sales for Corona Extra.", "Last year, we represented another record setting year for Modelo Especial with depletion growth of more than 16%. The Modelo Especial brand family contributed more dollar growth to the total beverage alcohol category than any other brand family in beer, wine, or spirits in fiscal 2015. Modelo Especial has become the number two imported beer in the U.S. with more than 15% share of the imported beer category, which has nearly doubled the share for this brand just five years ago. Our strategic initiatives in fiscal 2016 for Modelo Especial include increased media and general market advertising, continued execution with Modelo Especial Chelada, on-premise activation, retail sponsorships and promotion, and Hispanic marketing and advertising and media investments.", "As you are aware, the bench strength of our beer portfolio goes deeper than our two biggest brands. Part of what makes our collection of brands so powerful is the long-term potential of our smaller brands. So let me provide some examples.", "Corona Light. Corona Light posted record sales in fiscal 2015 hitting the 14.5 million case mark and growing depletions almost 4% versus the prior year. We have had good success expanding the distribution of Corona Light Draft and we plan to continue building on this success in fiscal 2016 by expanding our national Draft footprint with recent launches in eight additional markets. We are also re-launching Corona Light cans supported with redesigned secondary packaging which will be featured in our new advertising campaign highlighting Corona Light as the light Cerveza.", "Finally, we plan on continuing our partnership with Kenny Chesney which has been a great asset for this brand. Victoria has become third best selling beer in Mexico with a 15% market share of that market. In fiscal 2015, U.S. depletions for Victoria increased 60% driven primarily by the Mexican Hispanic consumer and expanded distribution for this brand into 19 new states. In fiscal 2016, we are excited to introduce Victoria cans into the U.S. market for the first time. Our support strategy for Victoria will focus on continuing to drive distribution and generate awareness for the new can format during key promotional periods.", "Overall, I am excited about the organic growth prospects for our beer business in fiscal 2016. As you can see we have tremendous opportunity to growth the business organically through enhanced distribution and execution opportunities across the portfolio. As a result for our beer business in fiscal 2016 we are targeting high single digit sales growth which exceeds U.S. beer industry and import trend estimates and is expected to drive operating income growth in the 10% to 12% range.", "From a brewery and operational perspective in fiscal 2015, we achieved our key brewery performance goals relating to utilization, quality and cost. All areas of the brewery expansion are well underway with the project expansion on schedule from both a budget and timing of completion perspective. The packaging area and high density warehouses are progressing on schedule as well as utilities and waste water projects. Fabrication of beer tanks has been completed and we recently added capacity to our can line in order to reduce our dependence on ABI for cans.", "The new joint venture management team has been established at the glass plant and has begun work on the next glass furnace to be built on site at this newly acquired facility. The team has done an amazing job during brewery construction to minimize the impact on commercial business execution in the marketplace. As we begin fiscal 2016, we will be intensely focused on the continued expansion of the brewery with the first incremental 10 million hectoliters of capacity expected to become fully operational just more than a year from now in the summer of calendar 2016.", "Overall, I am extremely pleased with the outstanding commercial and operational performance of the beer business. This has been driven by a combination of robust consumer demand, strong sales execution, excellence support from our wholesalers, creative new marketing and advertising programs, as well as the outstanding efforts of our commercial team and our brewery team in Mexico.", "And now I would like to focus on the operational results for our wine and spirits business. During fiscal 2015 we achieved EBIT growth of 6% for our wine and spirits business and increase operating profit margin by 130 basis points. Our spirits portfolio achieved better than expected results as well as our Canadian business which exceeded its financial goals for the year while growing share across all strategic product categories.", "Sales growth in the U.S. benefited from positive mixed trend and some favorable pricing as we executed price increases in fiscal 2015 for select wine products in the value and luxury segments of the U.S. market while also growing distribution at key U.S. retailers. Wine and spirits EBIT growth was primarily driven by positive mix and COGS benefits including reduced grape costs as well as positive impacts from ongoing blend optimization initiatives and productivity improvements.", "In addition, EBIT benefited from distributor performance payments as our exclusive distributor contracts included in the selling structure that is just based on achievement of specific executional performance metrics for the year. In terms of our overall U.S. depletion performance for fiscal 2015, our distributor sales to retail for Constellation's total U.S. wine and spirits business across all channels remained relatively flat. Now this compares to U.S. wines and spirits industry depletion growth of approximately 1% across all channels as reported by the Beverage Information Group for calendar 2014.", "As expected, our overall U.S. wine dollar market share eroded slightly in fiscal 2015 driven by the super premium priced segment which remains highly competitive and currently generates a good deal of the U.S. wine category growth. However, we have gained share in the important premium and ultra-premium price segments of the market and are working diligently to ensure our portfolio remains relevant and at the top of mind for our consumers in all key price segments. And we continue to experience solid depletion growth for a number of our fast growing wine brands including, Kim Crawford, Mark West, Ruffino, SIMI, Black Box, Nobilo and The Dreaming Tree.", "The strength of our portfolio begins with quality products and I am very proud to say that we received over 300 wine competition medals last year and 52 of our wines received 90 plus point ratings. This includes a 93 point score for Robert Mondavi Winery 2011 To-Kalon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve in the Wine Enthusiast and a 90 plus rating for our Ruffino Riserva Ducale Oro. And our list of achievements continues. Five of our brands made IRI's top 21 brands in 2014 including Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. 15 of our brands were winners of the Beverage Information Group 2015 Growth Brand Award including two spirits and 13 wine brands. And many of our other wine brands continue to generate great media attention from a variety of news and lifestyle publications including The Wall Street Journal, Food and Wine Magazine and Forbes.com, to name a few.", "Earlier I mentioned that six of our wine and spirits brands made to Impact Hot Brands list. It's important to note that this list includes well established brands such as Kim Crawford which has won eight years in a row and Black Box, which is celebrating its tenth consecutive win. It also includes The Dreaming Tree for the second year in a row which is a testament to the level of success of our innovative efforts -- that our innovative efforts can achieve.", "We experienced excellent sales growth of 8% for our spirits portfolio in fiscal 2015 driven by Paul Masson Brandy and SVEDKA Vodka. The recent data received from the Beverage Information Group for calendar 2014, SVEDKA is the only vodka amongst the top five largest volume vodka brands that achieved growth for the year. In a category that is evolving as consumer preferences change, SVEDKA continues to win in the marketplace. SVEDKA's innovative flavors like strawberry lemonade and mango pineapple are driving current success and we look forward in seeing the results from our recent launch of our grapefruit jalape\u00f1o flavor.", "In addition, the success of Paul Masson peach brandy has exceeded our own expectations and we are currently expanding the product into additional formats and developing other new and exciting flavors for our brandy as we have done with our vodka and our whiskey brands. Overall, we gained IRI dollars share in imported vodka and Canadian whiskey categories for fiscal 2015. Our Casa Noble Tequila brand has been fully integrated into our portfolio and we see significant opportunities to increase awareness and trial of this brand in the coming months.", "As we approach the Cinco de Mayo holiday, you will begin to see cross-promotional activities between Casa Noble and Corona Extra which will help capture more merchandizing and floor space at retail and in the on-premise channels. From a strategic perspective, in 2016 our goal is to grow profit for the wine and spirits business while also growing revenue which is reflected in our fiscal 2016 wine and spirits guidance to achieve low to mid single digit sales growth and EBIT growth for the year. We also expect to maintain the margin improvement we achieved in 2015. And we are committed to executing the following strategies in an effort to make this goal a reality.", "We will continue to focus our marketing efforts on a subset of focus brands in order to drive key brands that have scale, higher margin and the greatest potential. These brands include, Woodbridge, Kim Crawford and Black Box, just to name a few. We remain committed to margin accretive innovation and new product development and have launched an enterprise-wide product development process review to improve our results in this area and increase the success rate of our new product pipeline. We have a team dedicated to this process to make sure our innovation is thoughtful and measured and positions us to ultimately win in this area.", "We believe we have a winner with our new Tom Gore wine brand in the coming year. We plan to improve sales execution and increase points of distribution by delivering more effective feature and display activity at retail with added accountability and visibility for both Constellation and our distributors. Speaking of our distributors, our renegotiated and exclusive U.S. distributor arrangements are in place and will provide increased resources and improved performance metrics while enhancing wholesaler and retailer execution.", "For the second consecutive year, we plan to execute price increases for selected products in the value and luxury segments of the U.S. wine market. And finally, we plan to optimize our COGS through continued global bland management initiative, productivity improvements and lower grape cost. Overall, we are committing people, technology and resources to our work with our wholesalers and retailers to execute growth for our wine and spirits business.", "In closing, in fiscal 2015 we delivered industry leading market results for our beer business while exceeding our goals across the board for volumes, depletions, sales and net income. Our wine and spirits business delivered improved margins and earnings growth with the Canadian business and our spirits portfolio achieving better than expected results. Overall, we remain committed to challenging ourselves in fiscal 2016 in order to optimize the business opportunities that lie ahead. Calendar 2015 marks the 70th anniversary of our business which has become Constellation Brands. We are excited to build on the success achieved in fiscal 2015 as we head into the New Year with high expectations to create the next wave of growth for our company.", "With that I would now like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our fourth quarter and year-end results.", "Bob Ryder", "Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Fiscal '15 was a very exciting and strong year where we continued to strengthen our financial profile as we generated $6 billion of sales and 5% of organic sales growth. Expanded our operating margins in both segments for consolidated comparable basis operating margin increase of more than 200 basis points and established some all time highs with consolidated EBIT reaching $1.6 billion, up nearly 30%. Comparable basis diluted EPS up more than 35% to $4.44, and operating cash flow up more than 30% while crossing the $1 billion mark.", "We also reduced our overall average interest rate by securing attractive long-term financing and we advanced our long-term strategy related to beer glass sourcing and made significant progress on our brewery expansion activities. We anticipate fiscal '16 to be another productive year as we expect to generate healthy net sales, EBIT and EPS growth while continuing to invest in our world class brewery as part of our efforts to become fully independent from a beer production standpoint.", "In addition, given the financial strength of each of our business segments and the resultant capital allocation flexibility, we are very pleased to be returning cash to shareholders through the initiation of a quarterly dividend. Given those highlights, let's look at fiscal '15 performance in more detail where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results.", "As you can see from our earnings news release, consolidated net sales for the year were up 24% which included $941 million of incremental net sales due to the timing of the beer business acquisition. Consolidated organic net sales on a constant currency basis grew 5%. We continue to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business with depletion growth of 8%. Beer shipment volume growth of 10% came in ahead of depletion growth as distributors increased their inventory position during the second half of the year in an effort to be more aligned with historical levels and to be better positioned to meet consumer demand heading into the key summer selling season.", "Pricing benefits helped beer net sales growth reach 12%. Wine and spirits net sales on a constant currency basis increased 1%. This reflects positive mix combined with a distributor make whole payment associated with the planned distributor destocking during the first quarter and distributor performance payments recognized during the fourth quarter, partially offset by lower volume, lower non-branded net sales and higher promotional spend.", "For the year, consolidated gross profit increased $630 million. The increase primarily reflects $443 million of incremental benefit from the consolidating of beer business for an additional 14 weeks in fiscal '15 as a result of the beer business acquisition, as well as volume growth and favorable pricing for the base beer business and favorable mix and COGS for wine and spirits.", "Our consolidated gross margin increased 260 basis points to 43.8% for the year primarily due to the benefits of consolidating the higher margin beer business and beer pricing, favorable mix and COGS for the wine and spirits business as well as the distributor performance and destocking payments also contributed to the consolidated gross margin improvement. I would like to note that we have included gross profit and gross margin data in our segment disclosures in our press release and in our segment history file posted on our Web site.", "SG&A for the year increased $216 million. The incremental SG&A associated with consolidating the beer business was $134 million. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to higher marketing and SG&A for the base beer business. Due to the factors just mentioned, consolidated operating income increased $415 million and consolidated operating margin improved 230 basis points. Equity earnings decreased $66 million, primarily due to the timing of the beer business acquisition.", "Interest expense for the year was $338 million, up 4% versus last year. The increase was primarily due to higher average borrowings partially offset by lower average interest rates. That provides a good spot to discuss our debt position. At the end of February, our total debt was $7.3 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $7.2 billion, an increase of $281 million since the end of fiscal 2014. As a reminder, during Q3 we issued $800 million of senior notes consisting of $400 million of 3.875 notes due in 2019 and $400 million of 4.75% notes due 2024.", "Part of the proceeds from the notes issuance was used to redeem $500 million of 8.375% senior notes. The remaining proceeds helped fund the acquisition of the glass plant and related infrastructure. Our effective tax rate for the year came in at 29.5% and compares to a 31.2% rate last year. The decrease was primarily driven by the benefit of foreign tax credits during the fourth quarter.", "Now let\u2019s briefly discuss Q4 results. Comparable basis diluted EPS for the quarter came in a $1.03, up 27%. The tax benefit I just mentioned was a big driver of our EPS growth as our Q4 tax rate came in at 23.2% versus a 34.8% rate in Q4 last year. Beer business results for the quarter finished strong. Depletions for the quarter were up 9%. Volume and net sales were both up 11%. While we continued to see a pricing benefit during the quarter, it was essentially offset by certain adjustments to net sales related to the beer recall and other items recorded during the fourth quarter.", "Operating income was up 9%. Wine and spirits net sales on a constant currency basis were up 2% for the quarter. This reflects the benefit of favorable mix and distributor performance payments partially offset by lower volume. Wine and spirits operating income decreased 2% as higher marketing and SG&A costs unfavorably impacted quarterly results.", "Now let's discuss free cash flow which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spend. For fiscal '15, we generated $362 million of free cash flow compared to $603 million last year. Operating cash flow for fiscal '15 totaled $1.1 billion versus $826 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the net benefits generated by the beer business. CapEx for fiscal '15 totaled $719 million compared to $224 million last year. CapEx for the beer segment totaled about $600 million and is primarily related to the brewery expansion.", "For fiscal '16, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $100 million to $200 million. Our free cash flow projection reflects operating cash flow of $1.15 billion to $1.35 billion and capital spending of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion for fiscal '16. Our CapEx projection includes $950 million to $1.05 billion for the beer segment. Based on the midpoint of our guidance, we are targeting a 15% increase in operating cash for fiscal '16. This benefit is being more than offset by the increase in our CapEx spending related to the brewery and glass plant expansions. This activity is timing related as these projects are progressing as planned from an overall cost and timing of completion perspective.", "As you will see in our press release, we have provided an updated table summarizing the spending incurred and estimated future spending for these beer business projects.", "Now let's move to our full year fiscal '16 P&L outlook. We are forecasting comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.70 to $4.90 a share. Our comparable basis guidance excludes unusual items which are detailed in the release. The beer business is targeting mid-single digit volume growth, high-single digit net sales growth and 10% to 12% operating income growth. Given that fiscal '15 beer shipments ran ahead of depletions as distributors brought inventories back to more historical levels, we expect our fiscal '16 depletion growth to be above shipment growth and to be in the high single digit range. A result that would continue to be far outpace the import category and the total beer industry.", "Our guidance implies operating margin expansion for our beer business as we are projecting operating margins to be in the 33% range for fiscal '16. This is expected to be driven primarily by gross margin improvement as we plan to continue to make investments in marketing and our SG&A infrastructure at a higher rate than our level of net sales growth. For the wine and spirits business, we expect net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid-single digit range. Volume growth is expected to be in the low single digit range and we expect to generate positive mix, again take some pricing and generate additional COGS benefits.", "Interest expense is expected to be in the $325 million to $335 million range. The tax rate is expected to approximate 30.5%. Our guidance also factors in the initiation of a quarterly dividend. As Rob noted this represents a significant milestone in our history. Returning cash to shareholders demonstrates the confidence we have in the overall growth prospects and the strong free cash flow generation capabilities for both our beer and wine and spirits business. We are initially targeting a dividend payout ratio of 25% to 30% of our comparable basis net income. And for fiscal 2016, we are anticipating approximately $240 million in dividend payments.", "We ended fiscal '15 with a net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio of 4.1 times. Even with our projected higher level of CapEx spend and the initiation of a dividend, our strong projected earnings and operating cash flow growth has us positioned to meet our targeted three to four times leverage range during fiscal '16. Operating within our targeted leverage range combined with our strong free cash flow generation capabilities, provides us significant financial flexibility. Going forward, as our beer CapEx spend normalizes, this provides us the ability to evaluate opportunities to increase our dividend and resume our share buyback program.", "In closing, I would say that as we exit an eventful and successful 2015, the future looks equally bright. We are a leader in growing in profitable consumer categories that are critically important to our distributors and our retailers. At a consolidated level, a strong U.S. dollar and an improving U.S. economy are positive consolation. And we have minimal exposure to emerging markets. In wine and spirits we continue to expect mid single sales growth for the industry. In fiscal '15, we increased our operating profit margin 130 basis points and finished the year with a margin of nearly 24%. We expect to maintain that margin in fiscal 2016.", "We have some work to do in order to reinvigorate our top line but we have put in a lot of effort against this area as reflected in our guidance. Longer-term, we anticipate continued strong category growth and we expect to at least maintain market share. In the beer segment, we continue to deliver industry leading sales growth and we continue to make progress towards our mid-30% operating profit margin goal. We are on schedule with our aggressive brewery and glass plant build out which requires us to reinvest most of our consolidated operating cash flow in 2016. Our beer business generates very strong margins and the very high operating returns on invested capital, so the payback on this investment should be quite fast.", "In beer, we feel our strong brand equity, marketplace and distributor network momentum, opportunities to increase portfolio distribution and grow sales in the can and draft formats and favorable consumer demographics provide us with a very positive growth outlook. In addition to these positive business factors, we believe our strong cash generation capabilities and our ability to quickly delever should provide us ample future opportunity to increase returns to shareholders through dividend growth and share buybacks. With that, we are happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.", "Nik Modi", "A couple of quick questions from me. Bob, can you just clarify, you talked about other issues that affected the price fix number in beer. I just was hoping you could provide a little bit more clarity on exactly what that was? And then the second question on the capital allocation. When you talk about taking up the dividend, is this more about growing in line with earnings or do you ultimately see a payout ratio getting towards the higher end of your peer group, which is, I think, around 45% or so? And then the third question -- sorry for the multiple questions -- is on wine. What specific initiatives should we be looking at or for to really see the wine volume momentum turn from what we've been seeing in the last couple of quarters?", "Bob Ryder", "Sure, Nik. So on the first question, it was a little bit garbled but I think you are asking about Q4 pricing and Q4 beer margins. Essentially what happened it was really just a timing thing because of -- the big piece was -- because of the Corona recall and we got fully reimbursed from InBev for that activity. That just caused some anomalies as to how we account for that and the difference between what happens in sales and what happens in volumes. And then there was another reclass that happened in the fourth quarter. So what I would do is, I would just look at the full year numbers which would be more reflective of the real price volume relationship.", "For the second question on the dividend. We are just starting out. I think we are very happy, for the first time in the company's history to be instituting a dividend. And I think we wanted to start out probably on the lower level of where peers are and part of that is the fact that we are still right around the four times EBITDA leverage ratio. We expect that to come down very fast, but we thought we would start out a little slow. I would say that we are focused on 25% to 30% payout ratio, and we feel the combination of pretty strong medium to longer-term EPS growth would allow us to grow the dividend in line with EPS and in future years we may actually assess where we want to be in that 25% to 30% payout range. Right now we are at the lower end, but certainly we have room to go to the higher end of that range.", "The third question which is more around wine volumes, I will let Rob answer.", "Rob Sands", "Yes. Hi, Nik. Wine volumes, you know basically, Nik, we have got a lot of programs that we have put in place for our fiscal 2016 to drive, I will say better wine volume growth. And in particular, we have got some increased marketing against key brands. We have been increasing marketing. We have been doing a lot of research on exactly what kind of marketing will get us the best results, and we are implementing some new programs that we are very optimistic will in fact drive more sales growth in fiscal 2016 against key brands, and that\u2019s the whole portfolio versus 2015.", "We have got lot of new programs around activation in the marketplace and sales execution to drive points of distribution as well as increased merchandizing display and other activity at retail around our brand, so a lot of programs that we have put in place as we moved into this year and I would say we are pretty optimistic that we will meet our top line goals.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.", "Bryan Spillane", "So, just two related questions just to clarify on the guidance for fiscal '16. One is, if you look at the margin guidance in beer, Bob, you've got -- you're beginning to incur some of the operating expenses and expensing the expenses related to the brewery expansion. So you've got the can line in, you'll have more of the capacity, I guess, beginning to be tested and such. So could you just dimensionalize for us a little bit how much expense there is? How it's affecting the margins, and maybe how long we'll have that dynamic where there's some expenses related to the start up that really don't have revenues attached to them?", "Bob Ryder", "Yes, sure. So a good question Bryan. So, we experienced a little bit of this in the fourth quarter. As you bring these big lines on, a bunch of things happen. First, they start to depreciate. These are brand new lines, so the depreciation expense is not insignificant. Secondly, as you bring them on and you are testing them, right of the bat and this lasts for quite a while, you are not getting very good yields nor are you getting very good asset utilization. So that kind of increases your expenses. Right. So it takes a while when these big lines are coming on to get them operating at full optimization. And as we look at beer margins in '16, there is actually \u2013 there are some big movers. Right. I mean we expect to save a reasonable amount of money because of glass, okay, because we will be sourcing more glass from our joint venture location, which has no freight and has the lowest cost of produced glass of all our suppliers.", "That\u2019s a positive. Another reasonably big positive is foreign exchange. But offsetting that is an increase in depreciation, not insignificant, and some increased labor costs as you have these startup expenses and you are bringing on labor ahead of the time that you are actually getting a lot of usable product from those new production lines. So they are kind of the big offsetting things. That being said, we are pretty happy that we finished this year's operating profit margin pretty much exactly where we said we would, right around 32% in beer. And we are anticipating 100 basis point improvement even though we have got a lot of these new big production lines coming on stream. So we are pretty happy with that guidance.", "Bryan Spillane", "Okay, that's helpful. And if I could just sneak in, the guidance range at $4.70-$4.90, as I was just kind of quickly plugging numbers in I was trying to figure out how you get to the high end of the range? Because it seems like you can get to the middle pretty easily given sort of the revenue and the margin guide you've given. So is the high end of the range basically really going to be more predicated on how well sales do relative to your guidance, meaning be at the high end or above? Or is the high end of that guidance range more tied to some of the margin expansion?", "Bob Ryder", "Yes, I think it's probably -- look we are a consumer product company so the way we would like to get it is through sales that are higher than we anticipate. And generally that\u2019s what drive the bus on a consumer product P&L. So I would probably say the higher end of the guidance would be coming through the higher end of the guidance on our sales guidance.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.", "Bob Doctor", "Hi, this is Bob Doctor standing in for Dara. I just have two questions. First, on the long-term volume expectations for the beer business. You recently communicated a goal to distributors of roughly doubling the business by 2024 which implies a healthy 6% 10-year CAGR. I was just curious, is this a real target investors should be focused on or more of a pie in the sky number you threw out to distributors? And then second, if you could just provide some updated color on the U.S. beer pricing environment which has decelerated a bit? And then specific to your pricing strategy, is the plan really more geared towards relative pricing gaps or has strong volume growth really emboldened you guys to take more of an absolute approach? Thanks.", "Bob Ryder", "Yes, Bob. On the first question, I will answer a bit of it and then I will let Rob answer as he know more about the industry than I do. When we provided our updated capital spending guidance earlier this year, we did provide some medium term volume guidance which actually was driving the need to expand the brewery right from a 20 million or 25 million hectoliters. I think at that time we said the medium term volume guidance was mid-single digits, right. So I think your number was probably consistent. And that being said, next year's depletion guidance is more like 8% so it's higher than that. So that was kind of medium term. I think that brought us through fiscal '17, fiscal '18. For longer-term industry discussion, I will hand it over to Rob.", "Rob Sands", "Yes. I think the answer to your question is it's definitely not pie in the sky. I would say that doubling the business over the next ten years is based on what we think is going to happen in the beer market and in particular how imports are going to continue to grow and then how our portfolio is going to continue to grow based on what we see or know is going to happen with the Hispanic demographic group and the growth of LDAs in that group. We think that doubling the business over the next ten years is certainly a doable number. I won't say that we got so detailed in our distributor meetings as to exactly how that\u2019s going to occur, i.e. organically or otherwise. But of course over the next ten years we are going to have to have new products, new packaging, new SKUs etcetera, to keep the growth of the portfolio as it is. Plus obviously, as Bob pointed out, we are starting out ahead of where we need to be CAGR wise to achieve that.", "So I think we feel pretty optimistic that that is a very achievable goal and number.", "Bob Ryder", "And the Bob as far as the pricing comment, look beer is a local business. So we look at pricing differently by geographic regions because we have different competitive dynamics in the different regions and different competitors take different pricing actions in the different regions. So we do pay attention to the momentum we have in those individual regions. What is our key price gaps to our key competitors in those regions and we kind of make decisions in those individual geographic regions and that kind of roles up to the more macro number which you would see reflected in IRI or Nielson.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.", "Judy Hong", "My first question is just a little bit more clarification on what happened in the fourth quarter on the wine business, because you had a pretty big gap in terms of shipments underperforming depletion? And then you also called out the performance payments from the distributors, which I think helped your revenues or margins. So can you just talk about some of the underlying trends, if you strip out, number one, just the gap between shipments and depletions and then the distributor performance payments?", "Bob Ryder", "Yes. In the fourth quarter is where we make certain adjustments basically in our shipments to distributors to make sure that shipments do in fact equal depletions. So there can't be imbalances in the fourth quarter that are not necessarily reflective of the whole year. So I think you really have to look at the whole year as opposed to quarter-to-quarter because there can't be anomalies in the timing of shipments versus depletions. We also have some interruption in the international businesses as a result of the Russian and this and that, but I think that basically when you look at the whole year this was pretty immaterial. What was your second question, Judy?", "Judy Hong", "The performance payments, sorry, to quantify the performance as you had called out?", "Bob Ryder", "Yes. So also in connection with our distributor agreements and specifically in the fourth quarter of every year this is where we sort of look at, where our distributors have come in versus the goals that were agreed upon and set. And then there are payments that are made in the fourth quarter that can actually go either way based on our distributors achievements of KPIs. And key performance indicators in those KPIs are things like sales mix, distribution, for example. So in the fourth quarter they went our way last year and thus, again, that causes some, I will say sort of quarter-to-quarter anomalies. I think fundamentally you have to look at the whole year.", "Judy Hong", "Okay. And then, Bob, I just wanted to follow-up on the capital allocation question and this is really more 2017 type of questions. But as you think about CapEx, obviously stepping down, your free cash flow stepping up pretty meaningfully and the natural deleveraging effect that it has in your business given the EBITDA growth and your leverage targets. So how do you think about really levering up the balance sheet to either buy back stock at a more aggressive manner versus your free cash flow generation or even paying the dividend?", "Bob Ryder", "Yes. I mean that\u2019s a good problem to have as you know. And we are looking forward to fiscal '17 and depending on what's going on in the marketplace, my guess is we will probably increase the dividend at least with how comparable net income increases. And as I said earlier, we have the opportunity to go higher in that 25% to 30% payout ratio range. And I would probably anticipate that we reinvigorate our stock buyback program. We still have about $700 million authorized by the board and as you know right before the beer deal, in the previous like 12 to 18 months, we had bought back about 20% of our outstanding shares just under $20 a share. So that\u2019s worked out pretty well for us.", "But I think it will be a combination of those two. And I would presume that various tuck-in acquisitions in the beverage alcohol category might also come up. But as you said, as you look at the numbers, the free cash flow generation when we get past this real high tranche of capital spending, is really significant for our business. So we have a lot of flexibility on how to reinvest that cash. And I would presume that a reasonable amount of it would go back to shareholders.", "Judy Hong", "Okay, thanks. And then, if I just can squeeze in one last question. Bob, the glass sourcing in 2016, can you give us a little bit of clarification in terms of what portion of your volume will come from various arrangements? So the JV, the Vitro, the O-I arrangement you have in Waco. So just kind of rough breakdown of those relationships?", "Bob Ryder", "Yes. I would rather not get real specific on that but what I would reiterate is, our least expensive source of glass is the facility that\u2019s right next to our brewery. Right now it has one furnace that\u2019s operating. We have begun building furnace number two and its planned to go up to four furnaces. And they kind of come in over the next four years. So almost like one a year comes in, right. So that volume will shift from other third party suppliers to that local supplier. And when it gets up to a total of four furnaces, it would be capable of providing roughly half of our needs in glass. So that\u2019s kind of how it's going to play out. The good news is that we are happy that we have landed that joint venture and we are thrilled with our JV partner.", "Owens-Illinois has already exhibited quite a bit of expertise in operating these glass facilities and then tend to think very much like us, so there is no disagreements unlike some other joint ventures that we might recall. And the other providers are also quite professional and quite good at what they do and the good news is that in the total glass industry glasses is not a growing industry, we are growing our glass business. So we are favored partner. So I think it's a very good partnership between us and all our glass suppliers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research Group.", "Tim Ramey", "Rob, as you think about your outlook on wine, how would that reconcile with your outlook on the overall wine industry and where do you see the best growth, the pockets of growth, within the overall wine segments and price points in 2016?", "Rob Sands", "Yes. Tim, we think that the wine industry in general in 2016 is going to grow sort of low single-digits in volume, couple of hundred basis points above that in dollars. So volume 1% to 2%, dollars maybe 3% to 4%. Sort of consistently with what happened in 2015 depending on exactly what reports you are looking at. You are sort of looking at 1% volume growth in 2015 and again a couple of hundred basis points above that in dollars growth.", "In terms of where we are going to see the growth, it's pretty much the same story as historically has been the case which, there is I think pretty strong, continues to be a very strong premiumization trend. All the growth and more in actuality is occurring in the premium plus category. And probably the thing that it's changing is that it continues to move, I would say, upstream. It sort of started with the bottom of the premium segment, $5 and above. It moved up into what we call the super premium segment which is sort of that $8 to $10, meaning the growth. That\u2019s been very strong. And now we are seeing very strong growth in segments above that. So ultra premium and luxury, really, I would say a lot, you are going to see very strong growth in sort of that, almost $13 to $20 range you are probably going to see double digit growth.", "In terms of varietals, I think that you will see decent lower levels of growth in the most key varietals, i.e. chardonnay, cabernet, sauvignon. I think that Pinot Noir is going to continue to be a very stable and hot category in wine. I think in white wine you are going to continue to see very strong growth in Pinot Grigio and of course New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc I think are going to continue to be a very hot category. And then, I think another phenomena, or I won't quite call it a phenomena but a bit of a change in trend, is sparkling wines. I think that sparkling wines have become very hot once again, or I shouldn't say once again but again. They haven't been that hot over the last, I don't know, five, six, seven, ten years. And you are seeing some of the more affordable categories in the sparkling wine like Prosecco and some of the domestic California sparklers become hot and I will say more every day. I mean people are turning to sparkling wines as an everyday product.", "What you don't see as particularly hot is champagne. i.e. French champagne. But I think that it's priced itself out of the market largely and the consumer has turned to I'll say more reasonably priced and easier to drink alternatives then champagne. So sweet reds will continue to be, I think a trend in the marketplace. So sort of big, robust, slightly, when we talk about sweet reds, big, robust slightly sweeter, generic red wines. That's been a pretty significant trend and we don't see that diminishing in the near future. At the low end, Moscato has been kind of up and down a little bit. So it's probably going to continue favorably but not as robust as it was a couple of years ago. So those are the trends, Tim.", "Tim Ramey", "Good stuff. Bob, with regard to the construction costs and timing, I understand a lot of things like steel are dollar based, but are there peso based costs associated with the Nava facility and is that having a benefit to the overall estimate of costs there?", "Bob Ryder", "Most of it, as you said, Tim, most of the machinery equipment are dollar based. Actually most of the commodities and production are dollar based. But the big local cost of course is Mexican labor. So Mexican labor being used on the construction will end up on the balance sheet, right. And that will come down and price of that will be good but it's not a huge percentage of the cost and same thing on operations. Mexican labor in the plant and in the glass plant, right. Because we employ a lot of people down there and it's growing kind of geometrically. And as long as the dollar stays stronger than the peso, that will be a bit of a benefit as well.", "But the good news is because our end selling price in beer is based in U.S. dollars, we are not very foreign exchange exposed which is a great place to be, right. Because you remember Australian wine for those years when the Aussie dollar got so strong, it's very hard to maintain a good gross profit margin. So we are balanced in the currency of our input cost and the currency of our selling price which is just a really good long place business model. It's a good place to be.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, this is actually Stephanie on for Bill. I have two questions. Just the first in terms of what you're seeing in grape cost inflation or deflation this year and then what you expect the overall impact would be on your segments margins? And then my second question, looking at your smaller brands in your beer segment, you mentioned some new initiatives for your Victoria brand, but can you provide a little bit more color on what you're doing for your Pacifico brand? Thanks.", "Bob Ryder", "Sure. I can take the first one on grape. So we are actually doing very well on our grape cost. We had a very good year in fiscal '15 and I take my hat off to our operations guys in the wine business. The wine makers blending the wine and the guys in charge of sourcing the grapes and farming the grapes. Because we did a very good job buying wine and the landed cost per ton is kind of flat to even down a little bit. And we have done a very good job on refining our wine blends to make the cost to the consumer a little bit less. So we're looking good on the wine side which is why, one of the big reasons why we said we expect to maintain the improved gross profit margins that we experience in the wine segment in 2015.", "The question around Victoria Pacifico, I will let Rob answer.", "Rob Sands", "Yes. So Victoria is one of the -- Pacifico, I will start with that, is one of the smaller brands in our portfolio. I actually thing that it's a real sleeper and it's a brand that has a lot of opportunity for the future, much like we saw Modelo Especial explode as a brand. Pacifico, primarily West Coast, primarily Southern California, is it's really big base of business. We are focusing our marketing around things like the World Surfing Championship. We have got advertising campaigns in place around basically discovered by surfers in Mexico, in Baja. And we have got a draft program for Pacifico which has been, I would say very well received.", "So a smaller brand in the portfolio but something with a lot of potential. Victoria, again a small brand but the interesting thing about Victoria is that they are the largest brand in Mexico with a 15% market share and is very well known by the Hispanic, Mexican Hispanic consumer, which really gives it a huge leg up versus any other new product that could be introduced in Mexico, from Mexico to the U.S. A lot of these products or one or two that have been recently introduced are fundamentally made up products that Hispanic consumers never heard of. I mean that's a tough sell in that demographic. With Victoria we have also introduced cans. We are expanding the distribution nationally and we are seeing some pretty strong growth as I commented on initially, 60% growth on that brand in last year. And we see that momentum remaining strong into this year.", "I mentioned just in general cans. Cans is a huge opportunity for us across all of our brands. Corona, Modelo Especial as well as the other brands. We are really stepping up can introduction. And an interesting trend in the beer business in general, is that cans have gone from being perceived as so premium to being perceived as very premium form of packaging. And that's probably have been driven by the fact that the craft portion of the business which is the other very first growing portion of the business other than our portfolio, okay, has really adopted at a very high end cans as their primary packaging. And the consumer has really accepted that. So that's really kind of opened the window to make cans a great premium package for our business. And when you look at our business for cans, we have not been in cans at all. Cans represent approximately 3% of our total business but if you look at the industry as a whole, it's like half of the beer business is in cans.", "So the growth potential for cans is just absolutely phenomenal in our business and in our own particular case, as we have introduced cans we have really seen it expand consumption as opposed to just simply cannibalize other forms of packaging. Because we haven't had packaging that, I will say, is appropriate for the kind of venues where cans are particularly strong in the past. So this has been a big, big advantage for us.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Caroline Levy of CLSA.", "Caroline Levy", "I'd just like to dig into the D&A situation because it's going to be such a big factor as you bring on capacity. It would be incredibly helpful, Bob if you could, number one, tell us what the impact of expensing D&A was in the fourth quarter, for example, and in some way frame whether you can give us the actual number that you're expecting for FY '16? Or maybe say that it's certainly not going to be as big as the benefit from your glass savings? But what I'm worried about is at some point we hear that the D&A alone is offsetting all the benefits of the volume growth and so on. But if you could help us get comfortable with that, that would be really helpful.", "Bob Ryder", "So, good question Caroline. So, look, our D&A is going up right, because we are spending all this capital, obviously. So in fiscal '16, our D&A is probably going to go up 20% to 25% over fiscal '15 and that\u2019s because we are bringing on these new production lines and actually towards the end of the year we actually bring on some hectoliters of beers. So as that stuff goes into servers, you start appreciating it. So that does create P&L headwinds, right, as you go forward. But even with all that, as we discussed, we are estimating that our operating profit margin of beer segment is up about 100 bps next year and we are still reiterating the fact that we expect to get to the mid 30% range by the time the 20 million hectoliters is built out.", "Caroline Levy", "Thanks. And just to clarify, you've also very carefully figured out what the inefficiencies of testing the lines and so on does to you because, again, this is very new for you guys but we do sometimes hear our margins are going to be hit by the inefficiencies of opening a new brewery and you obviously wouldn't be at full capacity for a little bit?", "Bob Ryder", "Yes. I mean the good news, and again we are quite anomalous in this regard, because it's not like we are building the brewery capacity utilization from organic growth. We are moving the production from InBev to us. So although we won't be bringing the line up to the maximum capacity utilization that it is now, it will be still be better than what you might see in other industries as they build, say a Greenfield facility and it takes them, say, ten years to get up to full capacity utilization. We won't be as slow as that. And then as far as when these production lines come up, these are big complicated things and as you know, our brewery is highly automated. So there is a lot of software IT stuff going on. And every line you can't necessarily anticipate the gremlins that will come up.", "So we are doing everything we can to offset that. But stuff happens but we don\u2019t think that that will in any way material and it would be relatively short lives. And we are not expecting that to happen but it can. But that\u2019s all reflected in the guidance that provided for fiscal '16.", "Caroline Levy", "That's great. And then if I could just understand in terms of the last two quarters in beer, your margins were actually down a little bit in the last two quarters. What was driving that? Was it the D&A? And then in the first half of the year, do you expect more of that or can we look for margins to be up consistently in fiscal '16?", "Bob Ryder", "Yes. Again, to Rob's comment earlier, I am not going to go crazy on quarters because it's kind of timing and stuff happens. But Caroline the margins to which you are referring, are they gross profit margins or operating profit margins?", "Caroline Levy", "I was looking at EBIT margins, looked like they were down a little bit in each of the last two quarters in beer.", "Bob Ryder", "Yes. So the big reason for that is kind of ramped up marketing spend, will be the big reason for that. You know in our beer business, we have increased our marketing spend in fiscal '14, it was about 8% of sales. And we went up to about 8.5% of sales in fiscal '15, right, as we got into general market advertising for Modelo Especial. Got a little more aggressive against Corona in the face of the glass recall because we wanted to completely negate any potential brand equity loss that we had there and I think we were successful on that. And as Rob said earlier, we are ramping up some marketing around Pacifico. And we think that that\u2019s being a very effective spend and the beer marketing guys actually do a very good job of tracking volume lift and the effectiveness of the various marketing expenditures. So that\u2019s the big reason why the operating profit might have come down a little bit.", "And then also the question Nik asked earlier, this anomaly in the fourth quarter because of the Corona glass recall and some other re-classes that also hurt the fourth quarter. And as long as we are on marketing spend, as Rob said earlier, we are also increasing our marketing spend in wine, right. Because we are a branded consumer product business and we think that\u2019s important to keep the consumer brand equity going across all our categories.", "Caroline Levy", "Thank you. I have one last question. Can you quantify the payment on wine in the fourth quarter? The distributor payment?", "Bob Ryder", "No, we are not going to get into that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Financial.", "Mark Swartzberg", "Couple of questions. First, also on the margin trends here in beer, Bob. Oil prices eventually should be a benefit to your shipping costs from Mexico here to the U.S. Can you just give us a flavor for how beneficial that's been and how beneficial that might be?", "Rob Sands", "Yes. Good question. This is a kind of macro trend that you guys are probably seeing in a lot of companies. So net-net, even at this day, this is net good news for us because obviously we will benefit from the reduced oil prices on our, the unhedged portion of our oil exposure. And most of our oil exposure is around freight and there is more in beer than wine because they just ship more cases. So I would say oil prices is a net positive for us but when you guys get into the numbers you will see that we still had around $30 million loss on I will say, unrealized commodity hedges and most of those were around diesel hedges. Those losses will flow through the P&L over the next two years. A reasonable amount will flow through the P&L in fiscal '16. That would have been included in our guidance. But net net, the reduction to oil prices, I will say from a fiscal '16, is a positive. And of course if they stayed low, it will be even more of a positive as these out of the money get behind us.", "Mark Swartzberg", "Got it. And is it fair to think at the moment when you're bringing beer into the U.S. you're bringing some, so to speak, of your own beer from Nava and then some being purchased from ABI still. So the actual shipping cost for those two classes of beer, is there any difference? I mean we know that, obviously, as it gets into Nava it cuts closer to the U.S. but the actual kind of per-mile charge of getting it to a given location in the U.S. from a brewery that's owned by ABI versus a brewery that's owned by you, are they one and the same or is there some difference in that regard too?", "Bob Ryder", "There is actually a reasonable amount of difference. Let's see, quantitative difference. There is a lot more miles that we travel in the U.S. than we do in Mexico, of course. But I will also say that they are very different freight negotiations south of the border and north of the border. So south of the border there is not as much competition around freight. And south of the border it's almost exclusively rail freight that we do and actually even north of the border most of our cost is rail freight as well. But I would say that they are very different competitive environments in Mexico versus the U.S.", "Mark Swartzberg", "What I'm -- and maybe I'm not -- what I'm trying to get at is, once a product crosses the U.S. border, if it's coming out of Nava versus coming out of a brewery that's owned by ABI from a kind of landed in the U.S. perspective. Is the per-mile charge any different versus in those two classes, those two different barrels, so to speak?", "Bob Ryder", "Not in the U.S.", "Mark Swartzberg", "Not in the U.S. got it. Great. And then on the balance sheet, rates being where they are, one could make that argument that you should stay kind of in and around the upper end of that three to four range you have. You're at 4.1 now. Is it fair to think you want to stay close to four or how do you think about that?", "Bob Ryder", "Yes. I mean our desired range would be in between three and four. We are trying to balance a lot of constituencies. Obviously the rating agencies would like us to be very low in that range and probably shareholders would like us to be high in that range because they presume that what we do is borrow money and give cash back to shareholders. So we are taking both into account. So the ideal is in between three and four.", "Mark Swartzberg", "Got it. Okay, last one on that. If we just think about M&A, you've commented on this a few times over the last few quarters. And, Rob, you made a comment that you are open to M&A in the beer business and certainly there could be some tuck-ins. But when we think about M&A in terms of sheer scale, whether it's beer or wine and spirits, how are you thinking about this scale of any acquisition you might do in terms of like the upper limit on such a transaction?", "Rob Sands", "Yes, when we think about scale, we are really talking, I think, primarily about tuck-in brand type acquisitions in the couple of hundred million, probably range, or less. There just isn't, there isn't anything really big in any of the three categories that I will say ostensibly makes a lot of sense to us. So it's really just, I would say, opportunistic tuck-in brand type opportunities across the three categories.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI.", "Robert Ottenstein", "In terms of the draft business, we haven't talked about that too much today. Is the percent of your business in draft is about 2% to 3%, is that right? How much was it up last year and can you talk a little bit about what percentage of the potential accounts you have draft available now for Corona Extra and Corona Light, please?", "Bob Ryder", "We continue to -- I will start off and then Rob can follow up -- we continue to be very bullish on draft. We feel that we can sell quite well into retailers because our brands can distinguish themselves from amongst the thousands of IPAs out there that are on draft handles that need not turn as fast as us. We think right now Corona Light is our biggest opportunity for draft and Corona pretty much is from a very small base, but doubled its draft volume in fiscal '15. As far as Corona extra draft, that\u2019s still in very small test right now. So the big push in on Corona Light. And I think Pacific is still probably our largest draft brands. But our brands really position themselves very well in draft accounts.", "Rob Sands", "Yes. I mean I think the only thing that I would add is much like cans it represents it represents a relatively small percentage of our business and a relatively large percentage of the overall beer business. So it remains a big opportunity for us. We are being prudent in how we introduce draft for our biggest brand Corona extra to see how it impacts the brand where it's traditionally been only a glass on premise. So we are interested to see exactly what happens in those accounts where we put draft in. I think the results of our testing thus far has been that way we put draft even in high market share on premise, establishments, that it tends to be a market expanding as opposed to purely cannibalistic. So we think that that\u2019s a very positive trend.", "Of course everything that we do, we do it keeping in mind that we are not going to cannibalize higher margins with a lower margin business can. Draft is essentially the same kind of margin structure as our other package formats in general. So we are not overly concerned with it but on the other hand we certainly would -- we like the fact that it appears to be significantly market expanding when we put it in. We actually tend to see increased sales of glass in a surrounding area when we put draft, Corona extra draft into an establishment. And that\u2019s sort of been I think the traditional thinking on draft, is that it not only has just benefit from a pure substantive point of view, i.e. another format to consume the product, but it also has a marketing or advertising component that helps to sell your other packages off premise. And we are definitely seeing that.", "Robert Ottenstein", "That's terrific. And then just on cans, can you give us a sense of where you are in terms of rolling out your can capacity. How much is in-house right now and how much do you -- what percentage do you rely on ABI and at what point will you be 100% in-house on cans?", "Rob Sands", "Yes. So we are pretty much self sufficient on cans right now having put in our can capacity all ready. And we can produce pretty much as much in cans as we could possibly need. As I said, we are just rolling out a new can for Corona Extra. Corona Extra has been about, I think, 3% cans. So very huge opportunity. Our business overall, meaning everything to buying, is about 20% cans in a market that\u2019s I think closer to about 50% cans. So huge opportunity there and no capacity constraints whatsoever. And we can supply a hundred percent of our cans at this stage. So it's the year of the can.", "Operator", "This concludes the question-and-answer session of today's conference. I would now like to turn the floor back to Mr. Rob Sands for any closing remarks.", "Rob Sands", "Well, thanks everybody for joining our call today. I would like to conclude by saying that we are extremely pleased with our performance in fiscal '15. And we are already hard at work to deliver the exciting opportunities we have before us in fiscal '16. I am particularly proud of the fact that we are initiating a dividend for the first time in the 70-year history of our company. This complements our efforts to continue to deliver shareholder value. As we have discussed in detail today, we remain committed to driving the growth of our business while continuing to invest in our brands and operations.", "Our next quarterly call will be scheduled for the beginning of July. In the meantime, we look forward to a very busy spring selling season. You can look for us as we kick up our Cinco de Mayo celebration by ringing the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange. And as always, we hope you will enjoy our fine products for your own celebrations both big and small in the coming months. So, again, thank you for your participation.", "Operator", "Thank you.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Constellation Brands First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Patty Yahn-Urlaub", "Thank you, Melissa. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Constellation's first quarter fiscal 2012 conference call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer.", "This call complements our news release, which has also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP, comparable, organic and constant-currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com under the Investors section and Financial History.", "Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For details of the risk factors that may affect the company's estimates, please refer to the news release in Constellation's SEC filing.", "And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.", "Robert Sands", "Thanks, Patty, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our discussion of Constellation's first quarter fiscal 2012 sales and earnings results. Before we get started, I'd like to thank those of you who attended our recent New York City Investor Meeting. I hope one of your key takeaways from that meeting is that Constellation is evolving as a disciplined and tightly aligned company. We are executing on our strategic imperatives to premiumize our portfolio, build our brands, strengthen our financial profile and unify the core foundation of our businesses, all in an effort to achieve one common goal: profitable organic growth.", "As part of our ongoing efforts to improve the business as outlined in this morning's press release, we are taking steps to further strengthen the core foundation of our business. With the recent sale of our U.K. and our Australian business, we have significantly improved our financial profile and simplified our business, which provides an opportunity for us to increase efficiencies and streamline our organization worldwide.", "During the first quarter, we began to implement organizational changes in an effort to align our cost structure with our simplified business model. Bob will provide additional financial details in a few minutes. ", "And now, I would like to focus on a discussion of our quarterly results. We're off to a good start for the year with results that were generally in line with our expectations. Highlights for the first quarter include our excellent free cash flow results, continued debt reduction activities and significantly improved profit margins.", "In addition, the Crown joint venture continues to outperform the U.S. beer industry and the import category. This is being driven by Crown's focused marketing efforts for Cinco de Mayo and the second annual Win the Beach sweepstakes, as well as incremental volume generated from the continuing launch of the Victoria brand. ", "As expected, depletion churns for our U.S. Wine & Spirits business in the first quarter were a bit muted. This is the result of the following actions: During the first quarter, we took price increases on certain specialty and value products, which negatively impacted volumes; and, it was during last year's first quarter that our promotional spend exceeded that of the market as we worked to jumpstart the portfolio following the distributor transitions when we were focused on executing on consolidation strategy. Therefore, this year's first quarter represents a tough sales comparison versus last year, as we overlap higher-than-average promotional spend from last year.", "Overall for fiscal 2012, we are targeting promotional spend that is in line with last year's, although the timing is different, in that it is less skewed to the first quarter. Therefore, our expectation is that you will see improving depletion trends as we move through the year. As you know, at any given point in time during the year, we do post our promo activity as appropriate based on any number of factors, including business seasonality and the competitive environment, as well as consumer takeaway trends. ", "Our marketplace performance reflects this in the form of an increase or decrease in promotional activities that typically drives volume results during any given time period throughout the year.", "During fiscal 2012 and for the remainder of the contract term, we expect our U.S. domestic shipment to essentially equal distributor depletions on an annual basis. And on an absolute case volume basis, we achieved this goal in the first quarter. We are committed to maintaining market share and growing at least in line with category growth for the U.S. Wine & Spirits industry. During calendar 2010, we accomplished this objective and maintained U.S. market share on a volume basis in total across all channels, and we intend to replicate this performance again this year while achieving our profitability goals.", "As I mentioned earlier, our total portfolio, including focus brands, is facing a tough comparison issue versus last year due to the timing of promotional activity, which drove focus brands' depletion in last year's first quarter to a growth rate of more than 11%. If you average the depletion growth for last year's first quarter with this year's first quarter, you will see that an average depletion growth rate of more than 7% over the last 2 years. And while we're on the topic of focus brands, I'd like to discuss a new initiative that was recently launched called maximizing velocity and profit, or we call it MVP. This program is a result of our work in the area of pricing and promotional effectiveness, where we have developed a model to measure the success of different promotional techniques and identify the incremental returns for key promotional activities.", "Maximizing velocity and profit is dedicated to committing a higher share of promotional dollars against our highest velocity, highest margin, U.S. wine SKUs, of which are included within our focus brand groups. We expect to see the benefit of this initiative as we progress throughout the year. ", "From an innovation and new product development perspective, we have already launched about 50% of our planned product introductions for the year. These brands include Rex Goliath Muscato, Arbor Mist Pomegranate Berry Pinot Noir, Ruffino Prosecco, Woodbridge, Malbec and the Simply Naked unoaked wine varietals just to name a few.", "SVEDKA Vodka sales declined in the quarter due to an unfavorable comparison versus last year when there was significant buy-in in advance of a price increase for SVEDKA. This is certainly not reflective of underlying consumer demand for SVEDKA, which posted double-digit consumer takeaway growth in IRI channels during the first quarter. ", "SVEDKA continued to be the fastest-growing major premium U.S. spirits brand, approaching 4 million cases this year. It is also the biggest climber on this year's Global Power 100 Wine and Spirits Brand list, moving up 17 places to #29.", "For 2012, we will continue to build expected on premise brand awareness. We have plans in place to increase our digital and media investment, and we expect that you'll find our planned introduction of new packaging configurations and flavor profiles to be highly innovative.", "Moving to the Crown Imports joint venture. Crown posted a very positive first quarter with wholesalers increasing their inventory to more optimal levels in advance of the key summer selling season and in support of the continued rollout of Victoria and the Corona Familiar. Crown also realized positive depletion trends in the low single-digit range during the quarter. ", "At retail, Crown outperformed the total U.S. spirit industry, the imports category and the other 3 major beer suppliers in both case sellers and sales trends in the IRI food, drug, mass and convenience channels, posting positive trends in both case and dollar sales. And among the 4 major beer suppliers, Crown was the only one to gain case and dollar market share. During Cinco, once again, Corona executed full range of on and off premise retail promotions, outperforming all key competitors. Crown was the only major supplier to gain market share in either case sales or dollar sales during that timeframe, which is the second-largest selling period during the year for Corona.", "As we progress through 2012, Crown has some exciting business initiatives underway. And some of the examples include the expansion of the Corona Familiar 32-ounce bottle, Victoria, which has already been extended beyond the initial Chicago test market into Colorado and Texas, and was expanded into other top U.S. imported beer markets in early calendar 2011, including Arizona, California, Georgia and 5 other states.", "The Corona Beach Getaway promotion, which was so successful during last year's summer selling season, will be bigger and better this year. Now in its second year, the Corona Beach Getaway promotion will mark the biggest retail promotion in the history of Crown Imports and represents an evolution from last year's promotion including more prizes, more packages and a new promotional TV spot to drive consumers to retail to participate in the promo and drive display activity during the critical summer selling season.", "Crown also plans to extend its successful Find Your Beach advertising campaign, with several new executions which are set to debut throughout the summer selling season. Crown is excited to announce that Corona partner, Kenny Chesney, is back for a full 49-city Going Coastal Tour in calendar 2011, which is already underway. As presenting sponsor, Corona will capitalize on this partnership via retail support and in-venue programming to promote the brand.", "Lastly, the 2011 Modelo Especial summer promotion will build on the 2010 momentum by partnering with Sports Illustrated to offer consumers the chance to win an exclusive international soccer trip to any match worldwide.", "Collectively, these initiatives are expected to result in fiscal 2010 depletion growth in the low to mid single-digit rate for the second consecutive year for Crown.", "In closing, our first quarter results reflect progress against our strategic imperatives, including brand building and the strengthening of our financial profile and core foundation. Overall, I believe we are well positioned to deliver our financial and strategic goals for the year. ", "I would now like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our first quarter business results.", "Robert Ryder", "Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Q1 results were generally in line with our expectations. Our comparable basis diluted EPS for the quarter came in at $0.39 versus $0.38 last year. And we generated $220 million of free cash flow. That's $185 million more than Q1 last year.", "Let me provide some high-level comments to frame in these results before I go into more details. Throughout the year, we expect to have quarterly comparison discussions. Due to the FY '11 U.S. distributor inventory build, the overlap of the FY '11 supply chain disruption at Crown, increased marketing at Crown, the sale of our Australian and U.K. business and the outcome of various tax items in both years.", "Q1 happens to reflect favorable comparison items, which we'll discuss. Comparable basis EBIT came in nearly $20 million or 12% higher than last year. Of this $20 million, the North American segment increased $6 million, the Crown JV earnings increased about $6 million, corporate expenses were down $5 million and our Australian U.K. business lost $3 million in the prior year.", "These upsides in Q1 are timing related as we continue to expect a flattish EBIT results for the full year of fiscal 2012. This is the first full quarter we will report results without the Australian and U.K. business. Consolidated gross margin and operating margin improved significantly in the quarter as a result of this divestiture. ", "Following the sale of the Australian U.K. business, we have initiated plans to refine the structure of our remaining business and gain efficiencies. I will outline the financial details of this initiative in a few moments.", "We continued to generate very strong free cash flow, de-lever the balance sheet and reduce interest expense during the quarter. The EBIT growth and lower interest expense was essentially offset by some unfavorable timing related to our comparable basis effective tax rate, which came in at 37% versus 24% in Q1 last year.", "Given that overview, let's look at our first quarter 2012 P&L performance in more detail, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our news release, consolidated reported net sales decreased 19%, primarily due to the divestiture of our Australian and U.K. business. North American net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 2%. This reflects favorable mix and lower promotions in the U.S., partially offset by a decrease in volume. ", "Now let's look at our profits on a comparable basis. For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 39.5% versus 34.5% in the prior year. This primarily reflects the benefit of divesting the lower gross margin Australian and U.K. business. Favorable product mix and lower promotion costs in the U.S. were offset by higher costs for imported products and transportation costs, mostly fuel.", "Our consolidated SG&A margin for the quarter came in at 21.4% of net sales, which was even with Q1 last year. Consolidated operating income increased 12% to $116 million, and operating margin increased 5 percentage points to 18%.", "I'd now like to highlight the segment operating income results to provide highlights for our operating income change.", "North American segment operating income increased $4 million to $137 million. Improvement in sales mix and lower promotions was partially offset by the higher cost of goods sold I mentioned earlier and increases in G&A and marketing expenses. Corporate costs were down $5 million, primarily related to lower expenses for our Project Fusion initiatives. As mentioned earlier, the Australia and Europe segment reported an operating loss of $3 million in Q1 last year.", "Consolidated equity investment earnings totaled $62 million versus $55 million last year. Equity earnings for Crown totaled $60 million versus $54 million for the prior year quarter. For the quarter, Crown generated net sales of $678 million, an increase of 9%, and operating income of $120 million, an increase of 10%.", "As Rob mentioned, Crown had positive depletion growth and gained share in measured channels. The robust net sales and EBIT growth, however, was primarily driven by shipments, which exceeded depletions for the quarter, as distributor inventories are better positioned going into the summer selling season versus last year. Crown also saw improvement in net pricing and mix, but had higher marketing costs during the quarter.", "Interest expense for the quarter was $44 million, down 9% versus last year. The decrease was driven by reduced debt levels during the quarter.", "Let's take a look at debt. At the end of May, our debt totaled $3 billion. This represents the $244 million decrease from our debt level at the end of fiscal 2011, and was driven by our strong free cash flow generation. Given our near-term focus on debt reduction, we prepaid $400 million of term loan debt through a combination of cash and revolver proceeds during Q1.", "The net debt decrease drove our debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio down to 3.2x at the end of May from a 3.6x ratio at the end of February. Our continuing de-leveraging efforts drove credit rating upgrades during the quarter. These ratings are now one notch below investment grade, and represent the highest ever achieved by Constellation.", "As mentioned earlier, our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 37% versus 24% in Q1 last year, which reflected the favorable outcomes of various tax items.", "Now let's discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For Q1, we generated free cash flow of $220 million versus $35 million in Q1 last year. This improvement reflects a cash benefit for taxes and reduced use of cash to fund receivables. In the quarter, we received a net refund of taxes, primarily related to the Q4 fiscal '11 sale of our U.K. business. In addition, our receivable balance increased less in the previous year, due to timing within the quarter and the sale of our Australian and U.K. business.", "We continue to target free cash flow for fiscal 2012 in the $600 million to $650 million range. This includes CapEx in the range of $85 million to $95 million and cash restructuring cost of approximately $26 million.", "Now let's move to our full year fiscal 2012 P&L outlook. We continue to expect comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.90 to $2 a share, versus the $1.91 result for fiscal '11. I would like to reiterate a couple of items related to our guidance for fiscal '12.", "As a reminder, shipments exceeded depletions during fiscal 2011 for our U.S. Wine & Spirits business. For fiscal 2012 and thereafter, shipments should generally align with depletions on an annual basis. Our fiscal '12 year-over-year EBIT growth will be impacted by the fiscal '11 shipment number exceeding the fiscal '11 depletion number. In Q1 of both FY '11 and FY '12, shipments were generally aligned with depletions so there was no overlap issue. In the second and third quarters of fiscal '11, shipments exceeded depletions, therefore, in the second and third quarters of fiscal '12, this will present overlap issues on reported sales growth, which will negatively impact EBIT growth.", "For the full fiscal year, we continue to anticipate depletion growth for the U.S. Wine & Spirits business in the 3% range. As Rob mentioned, we expect improving depletion trends as we move through the year, given our promotional program, prior year overlaps and new product launches. The overlap of the prior year distributor inventory build should keep our North American Wine business at flattish organic sales growth and modest EBIT growth for the full year.", "Turning to the Beer business, as noted earlier by Rob, Crown is still targeting low to mid single-digit depletion growth for this year. As we have previously outlined, the JV partners decided on incremental funding levels of marketing and promotion spending by Crown for calendar 2011 and thereafter. This additional investment is expected to drive flat to slightly down operating earnings for Crown in fiscal '12. This marketing spend is more heavily weighted to our second and third quarters.", "For Q2 fiscal '12, we expect EBIT to be $15 million to $20 million less than Q2 last year, essentially reversing the Q1 fiscal '12 EBIT growth. This reflects the impact of the overlap of the prior year distributor inventory build in the U.S., higher promotional marketing expense in wine and increased marketing at Crown. This will be partially offset by continued positive mix shift in the U.S. wine.", "I would also like to reiterate that interest expense is expected to be in the range of $180 million to $190 million. And we are targeting a 29% effective tax rate for the full year fiscal '12. Given the 37% rate in Q1, we expect our quarterly tax rate to fluctuate over the remaining quarters. And due to the timing of various tax items, we currently expect the Q2 rate to be around 10%. We expect weighted average diluted shares to approximate 216 million. We did not repurchase any common stock during Q1, and our guidance excludes the impact of any potential repurchases of common stock.", "As discussed earlier, we began to implement organizational changes to increase efficiencies. As a result, we expect to generate cost savings of more than $10 million from centralizing certain administrative, operational and commercial functions on a global basis. This benefit should be minimal for fiscal '12, and most of it should be realized in fiscal '13.", "In connection with these initiatives, the company expects to incur one-time cash charges of approximately $26 million, including $13 million of restructuring charges from employee reduction and $13 million of other related costs. Nearly all of the charges are expected to be recognized during fiscal 2012, and would be excluded from our comparable basis results.", "Before we take your questions, I would like to reiterate that Q1 results were in-line with expectations, and we are on track to achieve our fiscal 2012 comparable basis diluted EPS goal. We're also on track to achieve our $600 million to $650 million free cash flow goal, including funding for the restructuring program as we continue to take steps to improve the organization and streamline the business. Our strong free cash flow should move our comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio to around 3x by the end of fiscal 2012. This provides us flexibility on our capital structure management. ", "With that, we're happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Just on the wine depletion trend, obviously, the comparisons were pretty tough on a promotional spending timing period. But if I just look at your mix now, so your focus brands is roughly 2/3 of your total U.S. domestic volume. If the focus brands can sort of grow in that high single-digit rate, it sounds like the non-focus brands really have to show much more moderation in terms of the decline or that the focus brands really have to accelerate at a faster pace. So can you just help us understand how we think about what's going to drive the focus brands to really grow even beyond kind of that high single-digits that you've mentioned sort of on a 2-year run rate basis?", "Robert Sands", "Yes, Judy. First of all, if you look at first quarter of last year, the focus brands grew, as I mentioned in my talk, about 11%. And of course, first quarter this year, they grew at a much faster pace than our overall growth rate. And on a blended basis, as we said all along, as we move throughout the year, we expect -- taking into account how the non-focus brands will perform the overall portfolio to maintain market share against the category.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. So it sounds like you really have to then step up spending more meaningfully. So can you maybe just talk about the margin implications as that happens? Do you have -- what was sort of embedded in that expectation?", "Robert Sands", "Right. We will spend on promo the same amount this year on a per-case basis taking into account mix, as we spent last year. Therefore, since we significantly underspent what we spent last year in the first quarter, we will step up promo spend in the latter part of this year versus last year. So basically, we just simply have the reverse pattern of what we did last year with promo last year more geared towards the beginning of the year, and promo this year more geared towards the middle or latter part of the year. So the answer is yes. It's going to increase significantly as we go through the year. But that's all baked into our guidance and expected -- was expected and this is what we've been discussing with you for some time now.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. And then, Bob, just in terms of the comparison items that you cited. So for the full year fiscal 2012, you have unfavorable comparisons because of the shipments and depletions like last year. But in Q1, you've talked about actually benefiting from some of the favorable comparison items. So on the Crown, it sounds like it's really shipments exceeding depletions which reverses in the back half. You talked about the Australia and U.K. business, which lost money in Q1. So you've got sort of the positive comparison there. But on the North American wine and on the corporate side where you saw favorability there, is there any timing issue that benefited your Q1 as well?", "Robert Sands", "Not really. I mean, Judy, every quarter, there's some timing issues about when marketing is spent or when SG&A happened versus when it happened in the prior year, but we would expect that to kind of smooth out in the balance of the year. So I would say, there wasn't a tremendous amount of timing aspects in the North American business.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. And then just on the -- on your balance sheet side, just obviously, you've continued to take leverage down. You're now below your sort of 3.5x leverage -- the target leverage ratio, how are you thinking about share buyback at this point?", "Robert Sands", "Yes, I mean, we're constantly assessing the capital structure and constantly weighing debt pay down versus stock buybacks. So the constant thing in the first quarter, as we said, we decided not to buy any stock back, but we'll continue to look at it as the year progresses.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Lauren Torres of HSBC.", "Lauren Torres - HSBC", "Bob, just go back to your guidance with respect to the reduction in your reported EPS range. Now that we're thinking about these restructuring charges flowing through, any guidance of how you think about that over the course of the year as far as quarterly flow? And then also, as you think about cost savings and maybe also the one-time charges hitting over the course of the year, I mean is that number, the guidance that you have on that cost savings number pretty clear now? It seems like maybe there's more opportunity for that. And I guess on the other side, if there's the potential for that charge number to go up, too, and then once again impacting your reported EPS guidance. Just any guidance on how to think about that.", "Robert Ryder", "Yes, I mean. So the numbers that we disclosed in the press release should -- that's our plan for the restructuring charge. Of course, the costs are not included in comparable results. We don't expect the savings to have much of an impact in fiscal '12, but they should be full impact in fiscal '13. Now obviously, we're not issuing fiscal '13 guidance. There's a lot of innings between now and when we'll issue guidance. So certainly, that will be taken into account when we come out with what our EBIT will be for fiscal '13.", "Lauren Torres - HSBC", "But is the clarity good? Particularly I guess on the charge side for fiscal '12, what the impact will be, and I guess any guidance about how to flow through that impact over the course of this year?", "Robert Ryder", "Yes, I mean, we're not giving guidance by quarter, but it's going to be the -- it will all be in there for the full year, probably mostly back-end loaded. And it's the $26 million that we have in the press release, if I recall that number correctly.", "Lauren Torres - HSBC", "Okay. And if I could also ask on Crown, you mentioned that you did see some improvement in that pricing. Just curious about the import pricing environment in the U.S. at this point, where is your portfolio versus your competitors? Is there room for more pricing? How are you thinking about that?", "Robert Sands", "Yes, this is Rob. Basically, the import pricing situation is very stable in the U.S. at the current time. And as far as our portfolio goes, we really don't have any plan to take pricing in our portfolio this fiscal year. We have talked about some reductions and promo from time to time and shift from promo to marketing. But fundamentally, we don't have any pricing plans on our cross-the-board basis. Now we do look at every market on a case-by-case basis. And if things have happened in the market relative to competition that warrants pricing, then of course, Crown will consider that on a case-by-case basis. But we're not taking -- I have no plans to take aggressive price increases.", "Lauren Torres - HSBC", "Okay. And I guess last question on the launch and the continued rollout of Victoria. I'm not sure if you mentioned how far through that process are you and how much more of that we'll see benefit the Crown business for the remainder of the year.", "Robert Sands", "Yes. Well, what I said is that we've now intro-ed beyond the Chicago market on Victoria in quite a few other markets in the United States, in some big markets like California, Arizona and Texas, Colorado to name a few. And the roll out will continue, but this was the next stage and we're working on plans for further rollout in the future. So...", "Robert Ryder", "Well, I mean the Victoria volumes were probably incremental for the quarter. And obviously, we're not in the fine beer selling season. So it won't have an insignificant impact on our growth. It's going to be a nice add, but it's all included in our guidance", "Lauren Torres - HSBC", "And that is priced out of premium or compared to the Corona and the other primary brands in the portfolio?", "Robert Ryder", "Correct. It is priced at a premium to Corona Extra.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tim Ramey of D. A. Davidson.", "Timothy Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "I wonder if you could give us any more visibility on the volatility or just the components of the rate volatility because that is -- it was a much higher rate, this quarter obviously a much lower rate in the 2Q. Can you help us understand that a little bit?", "Robert Ryder", "Yes, I'll try, but it won't be easy. So, I mean, look, there's a lot of different things going on in the tax rate in various tax jurisdictions. And essentially what happens under current accounting, when a company and a tax regulator come to a conclusion on a particular matter, that's when it hits your P&L. So as these things come to a conclusion, when the others come in and they sit down with our tax guys and they say, \"Okay, this is the deal.\" That's when we book the upside. So by nature, it will be choppy throughout the year.", "Timothy Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "And just one more, for Rob maybe. The wine industry, I think, has shown some incremental sales lift recently. I don't know how that's factored into your view of the overall sales of the category and how it would affect your focus brands versus your total portfolio?", "Robert Sands", "Yes, the wine industry is pretty healthy right now. And I'd say that in general, we anticipate that it tends to be about where it is. And we geared a lot of activity relative to MTV and line extensions and things to this is effect in the areas that are experiencing some of that incremental volume, Muscato, Sweet Red, Prosecco are examples. And we have new products, new SKUs in all of those areas and therefore, we should benefit from that. But nevertheless, we anticipate it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "I guess a couple of questions. Firstly, just to better understand the second quarter commentary. You said Crown down $15 million to $20 million. Is that right, year-on-year?", "Robert Ryder", "No. Total -- from the second quarter, we said total EBIT will be down $15 million to $20 million, Mark.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Got it, got it. And how much do you think Crown will be down?", "Robert Ryder", "We're not really giving specific guidance on Crown. But do remember that last year, we did have kind of a shortage of inventory at Crown, okay? So you might see an okay sales number, but remember, our increased marketing expense will really start kicking in, in Q2, Q3, because that's when the media is launched in the season. So you will -- if we say for the full year, Crown EBIT is going to be flattish to slightly down, and you saw our first quarter was way up, you can expect that to start to happen in the balance of the year, of course.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And if we look at the Wine business, it sounds like you still expect operating income there to be up. But sales, you're saying -- what are you saying about sales given the debt comparison? Sales get worse before they get better in terms of rate of decline? Or what do you say there?", "Robert Ryder", "Second quarter or balance of the year?", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Second quarter, sorry.", "Robert Ryder", "Yes. It's the second quarter, remember, reported sales last year included shipments ahead of depletions. So we will be overlapping that shipment in excess of depletions for the U.S. Wine business in mostly Q2, Q3. But that will hurt our reported sales growth number and our reported EBIT growth number. So I would expect in the second quarter both wine and beer EBIT to be down to prior year because of these overlap issues.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And is it fair to think of the 3.5% U.S. shipment decline in the quarter, in light of what you just said, you'll see a little bit greater rate of decline in the second quarter?", "Robert Ryder", "I don't know, Mark. I don't want to get into economic models.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay, fair enough. And then, interest expense guide of $180 million to $190 million seems high when you look at what the rate -- what the spent -- what the interest expense was in the quarter and you're de-levered. So why the $180 million to $190 million?", "Robert Ryder", "Well, so what's going on in that line item, remember we prepaid $400 million in Q1, so our rates have become more fixed because we're paying back variable. And we also have a swap kicking in, in September of this year, also at a fixed rate. So you can't just take, I guess, current variable LIBOR and extrapolate it forward. So I think if you do the math on that, you'd see that our interest expense will probably come out maybe at the lower end of our guidance. But remember, that assumes we do no stock buybacks.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Right. Okay. Is it fair to say that swaps is materially above kind of what your blended cost it right now, your blended coupon is right now?", "Robert Ryder", "Yes, I think that the all-in swap rate would probably be just below 5%.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Got it. Okay. And then this comment, this next logical step comment, and you called out the $10 million in savings and $26 million to get it. But should we think about the $10 million as the next logical step, so to speak? Or is the $10 million one of a series of next logical steps?", "Robert Ryder", "It's the next logical step. We have no other steps planned in that regard beyond the $26 million charge and the $10 million in associated savings. We don't anticipate any further charge into that nature this time.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then finally, you're seeing healthy growth in your non-U.S. business, I think it was up something like 300,000 cases year-on-year in the quarter. Can you talk a little bit about, and you talked about this at your analyst day, but can you talk a little bit about what countries are driving that growth? And in terms of cases, how much incremental opportunity you think is out there over the next year or 2?", "Robert Sands", "Yes. So I'm not, Mark, and I -- I haven't done the math so I can think of how you do the analysis to get to your 300,000 cases. The difficult thing on the math is, and I'll try to explain this, it's kind of technical. In last year's -- first quarter of last year, as the North American segment sold products to say, our international segments, right? They were, of course, illuminated in consolidation in the ultimate sale appeared in the international segment. Now this year, we continue to sell those same products through what used to be our international segment, but is now a third-party. Now in this year, we report those as third-party sales, right? So it's -- that's why, in the press release, we kind of highlight that and it gets you from that 8% kind of GAAP growth to more like a 3% comparable growth. Now we did not do that comparable adjustments down in the supplemental shipment depletion data, where I assume you did your calculation to get that international volume growth.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Got it. So in that particular table, it should've been reclassified in a sense in North America?", "Robert Ryder", "Right. So you can't really do the analysis you're trying to do.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Got it, got it. Okay well then that's helpful. And then finally on that, can you just talk about the case opportunity you think is out there for your non-U.S. business just over the next year or 2?", "Robert Ryder", "Yes. I mean, I'll do the organic thing, and then Rob talk about other stuff. But right now, the existing business we have, of course, is we do it in Canada. The view in the domestic market is quite small. It's not really worth talking about a lot. The Canadian market is like the U.S. It's pretty healthy, and there's a positive mix shift going on. In our first quarter, we actually had negative volumes up there, mostly because the lower end of the Canadian market is shrinking. And we have a heavy participation in that, but we did have, like the U.S., very positive mix shift because we are selling a lot of what the Canadians call, VQA wine, which is the upper end wine. So we had negative volumes, much better sales and positive EBIT growth in Canada for the quarter. And we would expect that to pretty much stay for the balance of the year. Now I'll call it kind of the nonorganic international growth, which is kind of our new international segment. I'll let Rob speak to that.", "Robert Sands", "And that is a relatively small part of the business at the current time. But as we've said, or I said recently, and I was certainly looking at some of the emerging markets, China in particular, and contemplating how many might take advantage of what appears to be fairly explosive growth for wine in that market in particular. So I won't expect anything material relative to that in the very short term, but we'll tell you more about that as we develop our plans.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kevin Dreyer of GAMCO Asset Management.", "Kevin Dreyer - Gabelli", "I may have missed it in the call, but did you breakout spirits versus wine sales and growth during the quarter?", "Robert Ryder", "So Kevin, to simplify our press release, we stopped breaking that out. But we do comment on the spirits growth for the quarter. Usually, the activity is around SVEDKA. And I think Rob spoke to the fact that SVEDKA growth in our financials was not good, but that was simply due to a price increase we took in a couple of state last year in the load in prior to that price increase occurring last year's first quarter. So our Spirits business had negative volume growth this year, but if you look at IRI, SVEDKA is still growing in say, the 20% kind of range. So it's more of just a technical overlap thing. We continue to be very happy with our Spirits business.", "Kevin Dreyer - Gabelli", "Okay. So from your shipment perspective, it is down slightly?", "Robert Ryder", "It is down, like, sort of low double digits.", "Kevin Dreyer - Gabelli", "Low double digits. And help me out, I'm sorry, I just don't understand how there can be such a big delta between up 20 to low double digits other than the...", "Robert Ryder", "Last year in the first quarter, it was like up 45%, 50%, because [indiscernible].", "Kevin Dreyer - Gabelli", "So it's just distributors running down in your total?", "Robert Ryder", "It's a difficult thing when you have a price increase. Everybody tries to load up the fuel price.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Carlos LaBoy of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Carlos LaBoy - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "We might take our wine questions offline and focus on beer instead. Rob, Corona Light seems to be getting a really nice pickup of facings out there. Are you refocusing or reconsidering the long-term prospects of Corona Light? And on a related basis, the second question is about Victoria. If you could share with us what you learned about the rollout in Chicago, who had sourcing volumes from and what you might have learned about Victoria in Chicago that you can reapply elsewhere.", "Robert Sands", "Yes, I think first of all the Corona Light, we're pretty optimistic about Corona Light. We think that there's more -- a lot more upside in Corona Light. It's the largest light import at this point. We're doing a lot of work differentiating it from Corona and giving it a life of its own. We've got new ads for Corona Light that are differentiating it, again, that are geared towards differentiating it from Corona. And as I said, I think that we're very optimistic about it. As it relates to Victoria, it's been a very, very strong rollout is the bottom line. And I would say that the volume that we've gained from it is actually kind of quite phenomenal for a new rollout, given the amount of the country that we're in. We're seeing good velocity on the brand in the markets where we've intro-ed it, and continued good velocity as some of those markets have become more mature. Meaning, you typically see when you introduce a new brand, sort of accelerated velocity initially, and then you sort of look to see what it's going to settle down to, and it's selling down very nicely to levels that should make it a very nice growing and sustainable business for us. So we're really optimistic. As for source, it's pretty across the board in terms of source. It's not cannibalizing our own business to a particularly great extent, but it's premium priced anyways, point #1. But you know, it's sourcing from pretty much across the board, much like the imports, much like Corona in general. It sources from the domestic premiums, it's sourcing from craft. It's sourcing pretty much evenly across the board, so it's a great product. And I'd encourage everybody to try it. It's got a lot of the characteristics of the craft segments, but it's also got the advantage, I think, of drinkability. Very drinkable.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no further questions. I'll now turn the call back to Mr. Sands for any closing remarks.", "Robert Sands", "Okay. Well, I want to thank everybody for joining our call today. And as I mentioned, I think we're off to a good start this year in a number of areas. And we are certainly on track to deliver our goals for the year. Our plan is to continue execution on our strategic imperatives through the remainder of our fiscal year. So thanks again for your participation, and we hope you have the opportunity to enjoy some of those great beers like Victoria and our Wine & Spirits products during the upcoming 4th of July holiday. We'll see you all soon, I'm sure.", "Operator", "Thank you for participating in today's conference.

", "Despite the lower sales impact, the EPS impact was $0.15, which was at the low-end of our targeted range of 15% to 20% as the mix of reduced distributor inventories was of higher margin premium products than we originally anticipated. This program is now substantially complete as we are within the range of our goal in terms of targeted average number of days in distributor inventories. ", "From a market perspective, the momentum continues around our wine premiumization efforts with solid marketplace sales growth contributed during the quarter by brands such as Woodbridge, Nobello, and Estancia, as reported in recent U.S. IRI data. ", "I also want to take this opportunity to provide an update relating to the U.S. grape harvest, which is underway as we speak and is expected to continue through the end of October. While we expect this year\u2019s harvest to produce high-quality output due to a mild, dry-growing season, we are estimating that the 2007 U.S. industry harvest may potentially decline in the mid-single digit range from last year\u2019s harvest. And it appears that overall pricing for grapes is moving up a bit, reflecting a decrease in yields and tightening supply for key varietals such as Pinot Noir, Pinot Grigio, and Chardonnay, with fairly stable prices for generic wine varietals. ", "Overall the U.S. wine market is very healthy and indications are that overall supply and demand should generally remain in balance. ", "Our Canadian wine business posted an excellent quarter. Jackson Triggs, the number one brand in Canada, posted double-digit volume and sales growth, partially as a result of strong sales across Canada of the Jackson Triggs Esprit wine, which is our Olympic co-branded product launched in June. We also released a 2006 vintage for our Inniskillin and Ice Wine, which we believe ranks as one of the best ice wine vintages we\u2019ve ever seen.", "Turning to the U.K., the market conditions in the U.K. have not change significantly during the quarter. ", "As you know, the 2007 Australia grape harvest came in approximately 30% lower than the 2006 grape crush. Severe drought conditions continue to affect the area, with the key wine producing regions of Australia currently experiencing rainfall levels that have been less than 50% of normal. ", "As I mentioned in the first quarter, these conditions are expected to reduce the output of the 2008 harvest, although we can\u2019t be specific on the magnitude of the reduction at this time, as the rainy season in Australia will continue through late October. ", "Due to the lower harvest in 2007, the Australian bulk wine market has begun to dry up. There is currently limited availability of bulk wine for production of low cost, private label Australian wines selling in the U.K. However, U.K. market pricing has not changed significantly as the wine market overall remains quite competitive. ", "Despite challenging market conditions in the U.K., we continue to increase marketing support behind our premium wine brands. We are focused on improving our go-to-market model and are working to improve our operating efficiencies. ", "Although we remain cautious, we believe the tightening Australian wine supply had some indication of trading up activity in the U.K. marketplace are positive trends. The Matthew Clark joint venture with Punch Taverns, which provides wholesale services to the U.K. on premise channel, continues to progress and perform within expectations, despite the U.K.\u2019s rainiest summer weather conditions in recent memory and the implementation of a smoking ban during the quarter. ", "In the spirit segment, the strong marketplace momentum from SVEDKA vodka continues with the posting of strong double-digit growth year-to-date. From an operational transition perspective, the SVEDKA integration is essentially complete. We are beginning to build on the strength of the brand with enhanced distribution capabilities through national accounts and the export channel, and we are capitalizing on and channeling our strength with retailers in the wine channel to benefit our spirits business. ", "The spirits business is continuing to benefit from premiumization trend occurring in the market and our focus on building our premium investment and priority growth brands, including 1792 Ridgemont Reserve Bourbon, the \u201999 Schnapps family, Meukow cognac and recently launched new products.", "Moving to the Crown imports joint venture, during the quarter, we were able to bring distributor inventories more into balance after working through challenges resulting from marketplace conditions prior to the formation of Crown. ", "From a market perspective, Crown implemented a price increase for its Modelo beer portfolio earlier this year and, as is typical with a price increase, we continue to experience a short-term retraction in imported beer volumes in the IRI channel, one that correlates very closely with the volume trends we experienced when we implemented a similar price increase in 2004. At that time, the negative volume trends reversed gradually over a number of months and we expect that trend to repeat itself going forward. ", "Crown maintains that this strategic pricing initiative is the right long-term decision for the Modelo portfolio of brands, despite a competitive market in the short-term. ", "Lastly, some of you may be aware that there is an ongoing tight supply of blast bottles on an industry-wide basis due to various glass industry factors, as well as continued strong wine and spirits industry growth resulting in decreased capacity worldwide. Although we are experiencing some impact from this situation, it has been fully contemplated in our full-year EPS guidance. ", "In closing, we continued to execute on our strategy despite headwinds from marketplace dynamics and business initiatives. We are entering our strongest seasonal period and are well-positioned to achieve our goals for next year. ", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Bob Ryder for a financial review of the quarter. Bob. ", "Robert P. Ryder", "Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Similar to our first quarter, in the second quarter we had several items which impacted the comparability of results, including the SVEDKA acquisition, the Crown and Matthew Clark wholesale joint ventures, and our initiative to reduce distributor inventories in the U.S. ", "In general, I am pleased with our results for the quarter as we substantially completed our distributor inventory reduction initiative, continued efforts to better position our U.K. and Australian businesses for improved performance, and delivered solid cash flow, which helped us reduce our debt by more than $200 million from first quarter levels. ", "I would like to start with the review of our P&L for the quarter, where my comments will focus on comparable basis financial results. The commentary for net sales comparisons will be on a constant currency basis. Let\u2019s take a look at our net sales line. ", "As you can see from our news release on page 13, our consolidated net sales decreased 39%, reflecting a 1% benefit from the SVEDKA acquisition, which was more than offset by the move of the U.S. imported beers to the Crown imports joint venture and the U.K. wholesale business to the Matthew Clark joint venture. ", "As previously discussed, these joint ventures follow equity accounting and are not reflected on the consolidated net sales line. ", "We experienced a 1% decrease in consolidated organic net sales for the quarter, which was primarily driven by our efforts to reduce distributor wine inventories in the U.S., which is now substantially complete. ", "After excluding an estimated $110 million of net sales impact for this initiative for the first half of the year, we estimate that we organic net sales growth would have been in line with our long-term target of mid-single digits. ", "We estimate that the EPS impact for this program during the first half of the year was approximately $0.15. Despite the lower-than-anticipated sales impact, the estimated EPS impact came in at the low end of our previous guided range. As Rob said, this was mostly due to greater de-stocking of higher margin premium products. ", "Spirits net sales increased 25%, due to the acquisition of SVEDKA and an 11% increase in organic net sales driven by higher average selling prices and volume gains. We are quite happy with SVEDKA as it continued to perform within our expectations and generated strong growth over the first half of the year. ", "Worldwide branded wine net sales decreased 1%. This reflects the benefit of reporting sales of our wines through the Matthew Clark joint venture, which were previously sold through our U.K. wholesale business, offset by a 3% decrease in organic net sales. ", "In our presentation of branded wine organic sales growth, we have added back $15 million of U.K. branded wine net sales in Q2 fiscal 2007, previously sold through the 100% owned U.K. wholesale business. We feel this approach provides a better reflection of organic sales performance. The add back for Q1 fiscal 2007 totaled $7 million and is included in the year-to-date data presented. ", "Turning our attention to branded wine geographic net sales on page 12 of the release, you will see branded wine net sales for North America decrease 4% as strong growth in Canada was more than offset by the impact of our efforts to reduce U.S. distributor wine inventories. ", "For Europe, branded wine organic net sales increased 4%, reflecting increased sales of popular priced wine in Mainland Europe, and a slight increase in sales in the U.K. Our Australian/New Zealand branded wine organic net sales decreased 7%. Our New Zealand portfolio continues to perform well but the markets in the U.K. and Australia remain highly competitive, with ongoing pricing pressures. ", "Now, we will look at our profits for the quarter on a comparable basis using information presented on page 14 of the news release. For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 35.2%, up 5.4 percentage points. This primarily reflects the benefits of shifting the lower margin U.K. wholesale and imported beer businesses to joint venture structures subject to equity accounting, somewhat offset by a temporary mix shift in the U.S. due to the distributor wine inventory reduction and lower margins for U.K. branded wine. ", "Our consolidated SG&A for the quarter was 21.2% of net sales, compared with 13.1% a year ago. This increase was primarily due to moving the imported beer and U.K. wholesale businesses to joint venture structures, the deleveraging impact of the distributor inventory reductions in the U.S., higher brand marketing support for branded wine in the U.K. and U.S., and increased stock compensation expense. ", "Consolidated operating income decreased to $125 million from $237 million for the prior year quarter. This change was primarily driven by the factors already mentioned, combined with reporting $79 million of equity earnings for the Crown JV, compared to the second quarter of last year when $74 million of earnings for imported beer business was included in operating income. ", "This year-over-year increase in beer business profitability reflects increased pricing and the economic benefits of having a national platform for the Modelo portfolio. ", "Now I would like to turn to our segment operating income results, which are reflected on page 11 of the release. ", "Wine segment operating income decreased $39 million to $125 million. This was primarily due to the lower net sales associated with efforts to reduce U.S. distributor inventories and U.K. and Australia business performance, partially offset by an increase in profits from our Canadian business. ", "For the spirits segment, operating income increased $3 million, primarily due to the contribution from SVEDKA and higher sales for the base business, offset somewhat by higher material costs. ", "For the quarter, corporate and other expenses totaled $21 million, compared with $18 million for the prior year. The increase includes additional stock compensation expense and costs to support the growth of the company. ", "Moving back to page 14, interest expense for the quarter was $87 million, up 20% over last year. The increase primarily reflects the incremental interest from funding the SVEDKA acquisition and $500 million of share repurchases. ", "At the end of August, our debt totaled $4.7 billion, a decrease of more than $200 million from the Q1 level. At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $2.4 billion of bank debt and $2.3 billion of fixed term and other debt. With interest rate swaps that are in place through the end of fiscal 2010, approximately 70% of our debt is effectively fixed rate. ", "We had approximately $850 million of revolving credit available under our senior facility at the end of Q2. This, combined with our strong capital base and free cash flow generation ability, provides flexibility to fund further growth. ", "Our comparable basis tax rate for the quarter came in at 34.7%, versus 36.9% last year. This rate was somewhat lower than our previously anticipated rate for the quarter, primarily due to favorable legislative changes in various state and foreign tax jurisdictions. ", "As a result, we now expect our comparable basis tax rate for fiscal 2008 to approximate 37% versus our previous guidance of 38%. ", "Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding totaled $219 million compared to $240 million last year, reflecting the benefit from our share repurchase during this year. ", "During the second quarter, the company received an additional 933,000 shares under the accelerated share repurchase transaction announced in May. We were not required to make any additional cash payment in connection with receipt of these shares which completed this transaction. ", "For the first half of \u201908, the company purchased 21.3 million shares of its class A common stock through a combination of open market repurchases and an accelerated share repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $500 million, for an average of $23.44 per share. ", "Due to the many factors just mentioned, diluted EPS decreased to $0.35 versus $0.43 last year. ", "Now let\u2019s turn to cash flow on page 10. For purposes of this discussion, free cash flow is defined as net cash flow provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the first six months of fiscal \u201908, we generated $131 million of free cash flow versus a $22 million usage in the prior year. ", "The year-over-year increase reflects a lower cash use for networking capital during the first half of fiscal \u201908 due in part from lower net sales and accounts receivable associated with the U.S. distributor inventory reduction. ", "In addition, CapEx totaled $47 million for the first six months versus $103 million last year, which included expenditures for our New Zealand vineyard expansion. ", "Our free cash flow guidance for the year remains unchanged at $160 million to $180 million. ", "As in previous years, in Q3 we fund the North American harvest activities and build working capital to meet seasonal business demands. Q4 is expected to provide strong cash flow generation, which has been the case historically. ", "Now, let\u2019s summarize Q2 and discuss our full year guidance. From an earnings perspective, we are pleased with our results. Excluding the expected positive and negative impacts on our results from our various strategic initiatives, we believe that net sales growth through the first half of the year is in line with our long-term stated goals. We will continue to closely monitor the Australian harvest dynamics and the potential marketplace impacts. The U.K. market remains a difficult environment but we believe we are making progress with the initiatives we have in place designed to improve future performance. ", "Moving to our P&L expectations for the full year 2008, we\u2019re revising our comparable basis diluted EPS outlook to $1.34 to $1.42. This is from our previous range of $1.30 to $1.40. The increase reflects the benefit of the anticipated lower tax rate I mentioned earlier. This guidance excludes acquisition related integration costs, restructuring related charges, and unusual items which are detailed on page 16 of the news release. ", "Additional assumptions for our full year fiscal 2008 guidelines are outlined on page four of the release. ", "Before we take your questions, I wanted to make you aware that we have recently filed a preliminary proxy statement relating to a special stockholders meeting and I would like to briefly frame in this activity for you. ", "The meeting has been called in response to a situation created by recent changes in U.S. tax laws. Under these new rules, the dividend rights of our class A common stock could potentially create additional income tax expense and accelerate the timing of tax expense for stock option recipients in the U.S. These changes would significantly reduce the benefit that option recipients receive without reducing costs associated with the option program. ", "In response to this situation, we have proposed to create a new class of common stock and amend our long-term stock incentive plan to permit granting of rewards with respect to the new class of stock to preserve the tax treatment of stock options that was applicable prior to the new rules. These actions require shareholder approval. ", "Finally, I want to emphasize that these proposed actions will not affect the underlying economic of the company\u2019s stock option program and will not increase the aggregate number of shares available for granting awards under the stock incentive plan. ", "With that, we are happy to take your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from Bonnie Herzog of Citigroup. Please go ahead. ", "Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup ", "Good morning, everyone. I just had a few quick questions. I guess first of all, given the Australian grape supply issue that we are all very well aware of and you discussed, I would be curious to hear how much of your supply is grown by company-owned vineyards versus how much you actually purchase on the open market. Hello?", "Robert S. Sands", "Good question, Bonnie. The vast majority of what we -- of our grape supply in Australia is purchased on the open market. ", "Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup ", "It is open. That\u2019s what I -- okay, I just wanted to verify that. ", "Robert S. Sands", "Open but under contract. ", "Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup ", "Okay, and how long are the contracts?", "Robert S. Sands", "They vary but it\u2019s just -- they are relatively long-term. ", "Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup ", "Long-term meaning three years, five years --", "Robert S. Sands", "Multiple years. ", "Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup ", "All right. And then just turning over to your beer business, I was curious if you could just provide a little bit more color on how you think it performed overall this quarter and I am curious if the disruptions to the East Coast business have been resolved in your view, and also trying to understand the performance in the East Coast versus the West Coast, whichever metric you\u2019d like to share with us, whether it be volume pricing, income, that\u2019d be helpful. ", "Robert S. Sands", "I think that in general, Bonnie, the beer business has performed in accordance with our expectations. As you know, we took a price increase at the beginning of the year. What we\u2019ve seen as a result of that is very much in line with exactly what we\u2019ve seen when we taken price increases, so there\u2019s really nothing different there than what we would have expected to occur, and as I said in my talk, we expect to see that to start to rebound. ", "As we also have mentioned previously, there were some high inventories when we took over the east and therefore, during the first half, we have now brought those inventories back into line.", "And then, with respect to your question about east versus west, I think we are seeing some very positive trends in the short-term, the last reporting periods for IRI and things to that affect, in the east in particular. So we are optimistic about how we are performing in that regard. ", "Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup ", "Okay, good, and then just a quick final question, just in terms of the currency, the translation helping your earnings this quarter. Can you quantify that in terms of the impact to your EPS?", "Robert P. Ryder", "It\u2019s not significant, Bonnie. We actually hedge most of that away. ", "Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup ", "All right, but I was under the impression, I\u2019m sorry, that it impacted your top line by several percentage points. ", "Robert P. Ryder", "It\u2019s about two percentage points. I think if you go through some of the footnotes in the press release -- ", "Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup ", "Thank you. All right. I appreciate your time. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Lauren Torres of HSBC. Please go ahead. ", "Lauren Torres - HSBC", "Good morning. Just a quick clarification first, Rob. You mentioned that you substantially completed the reduction, the inventory reduction in the quarter. By the word substantially, I guess it does assume or allow us to assume there\u2019s some more to come? And if you could give us a sense if there is, how much is more to come?", "Robert S. Sands", "The reason we used the word substantially is because there always can be some fluctuations in the short-term in distributor inventory. For your purposes, I think you should consider it complete and any changes in distributor inventory, which as I said really shouldn\u2019t be anything significant, are fully taken into account in the guidance that we\u2019ve given you. ", "Lauren Torres - HSBC", "And that\u2019s why you are giving us that $0.15 number, kind of stick with that and that\u2019s what -- ", "Robert S. Sands", "The $0.15 is where we\u2019ve added up with the distributor inventor reduction. That\u2019s what you should stick with, exactly. ", "Lauren Torres - HSBC", "Okay, and I guess too a question for Bob; in the quarter, it does look like you had some good free cash flow growth. I\u2019m just wondering why maybe you\u2019re not getting a bit more optimistic on guidance for the full year?", "Robert P. Ryder", "That\u2019s a good question and basically, we are pretty happy with our free cash generation in the first half but from a cash flow perspective, we\u2019re so early in the year -- I mean, last year we were negative at this point. And as we enter the back half of the year, especially the third quarter, the inventory distribution program is behind us and we expect to build up some decent working capital in the back half of the year. ", "I would say we are cautiously optimistic on cash flow but not optimistic enough to change the guidance right now. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Timothy Ramey of D. A. Davidson. Please go ahead.", "Timothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Good morning, a couple of follow-ups, one on the hedging expense. Where exactly are you booking that? Is that pushed down to the segment operating income?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, all the hedging I think is booked down, is pushed down to the operating income, so it is sort of invisible to you guys. If you look at the statements, I might have misstated the number a little bit but I think in the line segment, for-ex helped us about 4% on net sales. That\u2019s all in our net sales breakouts in the background, so when we hedge translation, we are hedging the EBIT of it, not the net sales impact of it. ", "Timothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Got it. And on the inventory reduction program, why did it end up being less -- it ended up being smaller than originally forecast. Was that due to strong consumer movement or did you just kind of back away from the program a bit? What changed?", "Robert S. Sands", "Tim, it was really a mix impact. The mix of the reduced inventory was skewed towards higher margin products and therefore the sales impact was lower than expected, but the earnings impact was within the range that we specified and we accomplished in general the goal that we were trying to accomplish in terms of what we took out. So it was really the sales and the sales was a function of the mix being towards lower volume, higher margin items. ", "Timothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay, and I think you mentioned that SVEDKA was running at double digits. Do you have a current case sales run rate that you could share, or what it has actually done in case sales year over year in terms of percent change?", "Robert S. Sands", "The first half of the year, it\u2019s been running very much in accordance with our expectations, very high, double digits in the 50-percentage type growth rate, and it\u2019s a great brand and it\u2019s performing exactly as we\u2019d like it to be. We are extremely happy with it. ", "Timothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay, and any other wine brands that you would highlight in terms of scanner data that are either particularly bad or particularly good?", "Robert S. Sands", "Well, there\u2019s nothing particularly bad but our premium portfolio continues to perform well. We continue to see very strong -- I should say strong growth in major brands, like Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Toasted Head, Rex Goliath. We are very pleased with our growth. ", "We have to remember that our premium wine portfolio is a very large portfolio. We are the largest and we look for strong growth in that portfolio and we are getting it. ", "Timothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Sounds good. Thanks so much. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.  Please go ahead. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "First, just in terms of the depletion numbers, are you willing to give us the depletion numbers for U.S. wine and the Crown imports?", "Robert S. Sands", "No, we don\u2019t normally talk depletions. With Crown, we said that we did reduce some distributor inventories throughout the first half. We\u2019ve brought those down. That\u2019s really the only relevant news, relative to depletions. ", "In general, our depletions and shipments are basically equal, so it\u2019s really not important to talk about depletions independently unless there is something to highlight. That\u2019s how we\u2019ve discussed this in the past. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "So if we go back to your comment about the organic net sales in the first half being up in line with your long-term guidance excluding the impact of distributor inventory situation in the U.S., we\u2019d take that and think that the depletions are up in that range as well?", "Robert S. Sands", "Yep. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "And then secondly, I just wanted to sort of broadly look at the global wine supply situation. Obviously we are hearing that the Australian is likely to come in much below last year\u2019s harvest. It looks like the U.S. is going to be down this year as well. If you sort of look out, kind of looking at the global wine situation, do you think we are entering a point where the supply is becoming tighter and that really creates a more conducive pricing environment for your wines? What\u2019s the implication from a pricing standpoint in the U.S. wine market and the U.K. wine market?", "Robert S. Sands", "I think that in answer to your question, we certainly see supplies around the world beginning to tighten and there has been quite a bit of press about precisely what you are suggesting, that we might be turning from global oversupply to global undersupply. ", "I will say that having been in this industry for many, many years, those exact turning points are extremely difficult to predict, but certainly some of those indications are there. ", "To your second point in that regard, if in fact we are at one of those inflection points or moving into one of those inflection points, that should be a positive trend that should be positive as it relates to pricing trends. ", "Again, we are not predicting anything at this stage relative to our business specifically, but the kinds of things that you are talking about could very well be the case on a macro basis, so if anything, as I said, it would be a positive trend. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "At what point would you be willing to sort of think that we are at that inflection point? Is it when the Australian harvest does indeed come in significantly below last year\u2019s number, then the U.S. is also short? Do you have to see a more balanced situation coming out of Chile and other markets around the world? What are the milestones that we should be looking at?", "Robert S. Sands", "I think that as you\u2019ve said, the southern hemisphere harvest coming up and then the next northern hemisphere at the end of next summer. That should give us some better indications of exactly where we are at. ", "Remember, as I said, this is a very big macro trend. It\u2019s not measured in any particular instant in time. You can\u2019t make gross overstatements about it based on one harvest or another harvest. It\u2019s going to take a few harvests and it should become more evident, as I said, after the next two northern and southern hemisphere harvest. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Bill Leach of Neuberger Berman. Please go ahead. ", "Bill Leach - Neuberger Berman", "Good morning. Maybe you said it, but can you tell us exactly how much the beer volume was down at Crown and how much you raised prices?", "Robert S. Sands", "No, I don\u2019t think that we did say that. ", "Robert P. Ryder", "I think you can get that off IRI if you look, but remember that\u2019s just sort of a microcosm of the total. You will see sales growth ahead of volume growth. ", "Bill Leach - Neuberger Berman", "Can\u2019t you just tell us the number?", "Robert P. Ryder", "I don\u2019t remember it off the top of my head. ", "Bill Leach - Neuberger Berman", "Was it like mid single digits?", "Robert P. Ryder", "I think that\u2019s close to right, around a mid single digit price increase. ", "Bill Leach - Neuberger Berman", "And the volume was down mid single digits too?", "Robert P. Ryder", "I don\u2019t remember the volume, frankly. I think it was lower. It wasn\u2019t down that low. ", "Bill Leach - Neuberger Berman", "So their revenues were actually up?", "Robert P. Ryder", "It was probably down low single digits. ", "Bill Leach - Neuberger Berman", "Okay. ", "Robert S. Sands", "There is a pattern to this, at least in the beer business, as to how the volume growth wanes after you take a price increase and how it gradually comes back over time as the retailers and consumers adjust to it. ", "Bill Leach - Neuberger Berman", "Okay, but we can say the volume was down low single digits in the quarter?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Again, as you know, we don\u2019t consolidate Crown so that doesn\u2019t flow through our financials. ", "Bill Leach - Neuberger Berman", "Right but it obviously impacts your equity income, so we need to know how the health of the business is. ", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, I just don\u2019t remember the volume thing. If you look at the -- and again, it\u2019s year over year because last year we were just west coast. We don\u2019t have complete visibility into what the east coast volumes did last year, east coast sales did last year, so unfortunately it\u2019s not a real clear road map. ", "Bill Leach - Neuberger Berman", "It looks like the stock compensation expense was about $0.03 a share; is that right?", "Robert P. Ryder", "That seems high to me, but as you know what we did is we changed the option program and this will be filtering into our P&L over four years. This is the second of four years that you will see increased stock compensation expense, and I think it was closer to a penny. ", "Bill Leach - Neuberger Berman", "But you show it as of six months, it\u2019s almost $17 million pretax, versus $7.8 million last year. It\u2019s a big increase. ", "Robert P. Ryder", "That\u2019s year-to-date numbers. Are you talking the quarter or -- ", "Bill Leach - Neuberger Berman", "Yes, well, I would like to know the quarter. ", "Robert P. Ryder", "The quarter was about a penny. ", "Bill Leach - Neuberger Berman", "A penny. Okay, thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jonathan Feeney of Wachovia Securities. Please go ahead.", "Brian Scodari - Wachovia Securities", "Good morning. This is actually Brian [Scodari] on behalf of John Feeney. In regard to distributor inventory reduction, I was wondering if you could give us any color on what types of safeguards and/or consumer data that you\u2019ve put in place to prevent this problem from reoccurring in the future?", "Robert S. Sands", "There\u2019s really not the need for any safeguards. The key is over a longer range period that shipments and depletions should be somewhat equal, and that\u2019s largely in our control. We monitor that and we don\u2019t expect to take, as I said in the medium term or long term, distributor inventories up. Now there are fluctuations from time to time, as we have said in the past. You might see, for instance, in the quarter leading up to the holiday season, it\u2019s necessary to build some inventories because we have sales growth during those periods and then in periods that are not as fast, you might see some inventories going down. But generally depletions and shipments are equal. ", "Brian Scodari - Wachovia Securities", "And just one more on the joint venture front -- ", "Robert S. Sands", "Sorry, what was that?", "Brian Scodari - Wachovia Securities", "Just one more on the joint venture front, particularly with Matthew Clark wholesale business. How is that working out? I mean, essentially you have partnered with a customer, so does that close the door to others? Or does that particular JV change the go-to-market in any way that limits you?", "Robert S. Sands", "Number one, they were not a big customer and the direct answer to your question is no, it really doesn\u2019t limit us. That marketplace is -- well, let me just put it a little differently. We sell to thousands and thousands, tens of thousands of different outlets. What they buy is largely a function of price and service and they are not particularly concerned with corporate ownership structures. They are concerned, as I said, with the price and the service they are getting for the products that they are purchasing. So it is really not a factor in dealing with our tens of thousands of customers around the country. ", "Brian Scodari - Wachovia Securities", "Great, thanks. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Christine Farkas of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you very much. I would like to start with spirits\u2019 trends, if I could. We\u2019ve heard some anecdotal evidence that perhaps the low end of the market is getting hurt but the high end, of course, is trading up. Your organic growth is pretty strong. Could you just give me a little bit of a sense of mix and what is growing and what isn\u2019t?", "Robert P. Ryder", "I would say for the quarter, we experienced some positive mix shifts, so what you are saying is pretty correct, that the low end of the market is not growing as fast as the upper end of the market and our higher price per bottle brands, which also carry higher profits with them, are growing faster than the lower price per bottle brands. Similar to the wine business. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "But on that, given your organic growth up 11%, how much of your portfolio would you consider low end versus high end now?", "Robert P. Ryder", "It\u2019s probably about 50-50. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, so that means pretty strong growth at the high end, I guess, with some of the innovation that you\u2019ve put out there. ", "Robert S. Sands", "It\u2019s actually a little bit less than that. It\u2019s somewhat less than that but we do have very strong growth in the high end and that is causing the mix shift. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Moving to Canada, good growth in that market. I\u2019m just wondering, and perhaps this might be looking a little bit over-analytical at the market, but with the strong dollar, are there fewer imports going into Canada that might perhaps allow your domestic brands to thrive even more? Is there any of that going on in Canada?", "Robert S. Sands", "Actually, the import business in Canada is very strong, as well as the domestic business, and remember imports into Canada are coming from a lot of different places, like Australia, like Chile, and like the U.S. ", "I don\u2019t think that we\u2019ve really seen the -- well, in general, the import business has been strong and it has not been hurting the domestic business, which has also remained strong. In particular, the premium end of the market, what we call DQA, which are the entirely produced in Canada products, they also remain very strong. So really both ends of the market are good. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, so that\u2019s good. It\u2019s not hurting your business. Your exports from California to Canada, has that gone up?", "Robert S. Sands", "Our exports -- I\u2019m sorry, what did you say?", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Your exports from California, for example, into Canada, does your business benefit just based on your strong base and distribution in Canada?", "Robert S. Sands", "Our exports have been fine, but remember we export to Canada from a number our different wine producing regions, like Australia. And I would also point out that Vincorp has a strong import business, as well as a strong domestic business, so we are really positioned to take advantage of all the positive trends, both imports and domestic. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful, and just on Australia, again similarly with Australian supplies potentially drying up here and the Australian segment really dominating that $5 to $9 price point, I\u2019m wondering if either your forecasts or even existing trends so far, would your own brands in the $5 to $9 segment, like a Woodbridge, for example, be in a better position should those supplies just really slow into North America?", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes, I would say the answer to that is yes, even though I would also say that Woodbridge is performing exceptionally well, given that it\u2019s a huge brand and the biggest brand in the category and segment. We are seeing some good growth for a brand that size, so even without imports being hurt or Australian imports being particularly hurt, we are seeing strong Woodbridge growth as we sit here. But clearly what you\u2019ve suggested could be the case as well. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful, and sorry, last quick point on SG&A; you mentioned stock compensation up and marketing up in terms of some brand spend, but also SG&A higher based on I guess the transition or destocking. Can you quantify how much of that SG&A increase is considered more one-time in nature in the quarter?", "Robert S. Sands", "I think that the SG&A increase is due to the change in equity accounting of our major segments, of Crown and Matthew Clark, so I think that that\u2019s what you are really seeing there. That\u2019s why SG&A has become a larger percentage of net sales as we eliminated from the net sales line the businesses that we are now accounting for in the equity method. ", "Robert P. Ryder", "I would say that there\u2019s not any big one-time absolute dollar cost in there. It\u2019s just that as a percentage of sales, as Rob said, that the geography has changed because we took so many sales out because of the JV accounting. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Thanks so much. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from [Qamil Varawalla] of UBS. Please go ahead. ", "Qamil Varawalla - UBS", "Thank you. A couple of things. First thing, on the distributor inventory issue, now that you\u2019ve gone through it, could you talk a little bit about distributor support and investment behind the brands? I remember when you first announced the program one of the intentions were to free up some working capital at the distributor levels so that they can support your brands more and I just want to see if you can give us an update on that. ", "Robert S. Sands", "I think that it\u2019s having the intended result. We are working well with our distributors. We are a very large supplier. The distributor inventory reduction has benefited them and they are very willing to partner with us to continue to build our brands and our portfolios and that was really the whole idea behind the whole thing. So I think we are very positive in that regard and our partnership remains very strong in that regard. ", "Qamil Varawalla - UBS", "So incrementally, is the support higher than it was?", "Robert S. Sands", "It is a huge -- you know, we have thousands and thousands of distributors and it\u2019s hard to make that kind of a judgment because it is something that is constantly in flux and there is all sorts of mix and so on and so forth, but we, as I said, are getting good distributor support against our growth initiatives, so I think it\u2019s working. ", "Qamil Varawalla - UBS", "Okay, thanks and then on the Crown side, how much are you reliant or do you expect the domestic brewers to begin to take some pricing this fall in order to get volumes to start to pick up again in the Modelo portfolio?", "Robert S. Sands", "We are not relying on anything. We are not privy to what the domestic brewers are going to do and when they are going to do it. There is already anecdotal evidence that there\u2019s pricing being taken in the marketplace, reading all the typical trade press and so on and so forth, so we think that that\u2019s happening, which is fairly consistent with the patterns of the past. When the high end takes the pricing, usually the lower end bows after a certain period of time. So the anecdotal evidence is that that\u2019s the case. ", "Qamil Varawalla - UBS", "Okay, got it, and then the last thing, you talked about no changes in the business in the U.K., yet your organic number in Europe for branded wine seemed to be fairly strong when you adjust for the wholesale. Could you talk a little bit where the growth is there and where it\u2019s coming from?", "Robert S. Sands", "In the first half, particularly in the first quarter we had some very strong growth, a little less on the second quarter and it\u2019s been coming from mainland Europe. We are really not overemphasizing that because a lot of it has come from, some of the growth has come from lower margin product that we\u2019ve sold in mainland Europe, so it\u2019s not necessarily flowing through to the bottom line in a big way. I think that\u2019s basically the answer to your question. Volumes in general and in our U.K. and Europe business are not -- this is a double negative -- are not unhealthy. In other words, they are healthy but we do -- it is a competitive market. There continues to be pricing and margining issues. We continue to work through that and we are at best cautiously optimistic about our recovery plans there. ", "Qamil Varawalla - UBS", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Nicolaus.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Thanks, Operator. Good morning, guys. Rob, on this destocking and then a couple of financial questions for you, Bob. I want to make sure I\u2019m piecing the pieces together properly here. It sounds like you are basically saying that at the distributor level, you are simply leaving inventories at a higher level than you originally anticipated because you are not in fact seeing a material pick-up in depletion rates out of those distributors, which might be a very sound business decision but I\u2019m just trying to understand ultimately what drove this 110 versus 160 or higher. ", "Robert S. Sands", "No, that\u2019s not right, Mark. We met our goals at the distributor level. The reason that the dollar sales number is lower than the range that we gave is because of the mix impact towards lower volume, higher margin products. What we had said originally was that we were targeting about a 25% to 30% reduction in days, and as we look sort of market by market, distributor by distributor, product by product, we have accomplished those goals, so we have accomplished the goal that we have set forth. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, but higher -- I guess we can move on, but higher margin ", "Robert S. Sands", "Based on lower volume, higher margin products, right. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Right, so that means even less absolute volume was taken out of your distributors, but it is what it is. Just in terms of financial items, Bob, I might have missed it, but as it relates to fiscal -- looking beyond fiscal \u201908, in the past you guys have said that using fiscal \u201907 as an earnings base, you expect to return over the medium to long-term to high single-digit to low double-digit EPS growth. I might have missed it in your prepared remarks but is that still your view?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, I think that\u2019s still -- why do you think our remarks are prepared? This is all unscripted. Yes, we are not -- obviously we are not talking about next year yet but nothing we see this year would be changing what we said historically about long-term trends in the business. It\u2019s still an extremely healthy category. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, great, and then lastly, just on fiscal \u201908, as you look at your share count assumptions, you are saying 225 million for the year. You are at 219.3 in the quarter, so that 225 implies a fairly meaningful pick-up in the second half. ", "Robert P. Ryder", "I think it\u2019s a weighted average thing, the way the EPS is calculated. I think it is done on a year-to-date basis, so you had a higher share count sort of in the front-end of the year. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Right, but I\u2019m saying if you take the 219 and the higher number for the first quarter, and then if you just take 219 and hold it constant for the balance of the year, you are at more like 223 I think for the full year. So it basically implies you are expecting it to go up a good bit again in the second half. ", "Robert P. Ryder", "It would be mostly just how the option dilution kicks in to the calculation. Obviously we are not -- we don\u2019t plan to issue or buy back any more shares. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Excellent. Okay, that\u2019s what I thought. Thanks very much. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question is coming from Bryan Spillane of Banc of America Securities. Please go ahead. ", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America", "Good morning, everybody. Just two points; one a point of clarification. Are the distributor inventory correction or draw-down for Crown is all -- is completed, right? You are not -- Crown is not in a position where they are still destocking wholesaler inventories, is that correct?", "Robert S. Sands", "Correct. ", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America", "Okay, and then second -- ", "Robert S. Sands", "Again, not taking into account short-term fluctuations, but in general that\u2019s correct. ", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America", "Okay, and then the second point is Rob, if you could talk a bit about looking into the holidays in the U.K., is your participation in promotions with retailers, sort of what\u2019s on your holiday merchandising calendar this year any different than last year? I guess what I\u2019m trying to drive at is do you expect that your shelf space, your display space, and the number of promotion activities this year to be on par with, greater than, or less than last year?", "Robert S. Sands", "We don\u2019t know that until after the holiday, unfortunately, but a lot of the processes going into the holidays is all about working out our promotional programs with the major retailers. Based on what I\u2019m hearing, we\u2019re being very successful in getting our holiday promotions locked away and I\u2019m hoping for a better holiday season in that regard than we had last year, which was not necessarily particularly negative or otherwise, but our portfolio is a good portfolio. The market is fairly strong and what I\u2019m hearing is that retailers are favorable towards what we are doing and so I\u2019m looking forward to a good holiday season in terms of promotional activities. So I don\u2019t see anything negative in any respect on the horizon in that regard, Bryan. ", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America", "Okay, great. Thanks, guys. ", "Robert S. Sands", "Sure. Okay. Well, thanks for joining our call today and I would characterize this quarter as one of continued execution toward our goals. We delivered solid cash performance and paid down debt. We substantially completed our U.S. wine distributor inventory reduction program. We are driving marketplace initiatives around the world, which will help us drive growth from our portfolio of products, and from a financial perspective, we believe that we are well-positioned to achieve our revised full year EPS goal and free cash flow targets. ", "Thanks again, everybody, for your participation. Our next call is scheduled after the New Year, so I am sure everybody will responsibly enjoy some of our excellent products during the upcoming holiday season. I will talk to you all after that. Thanks. ", "Operator", "Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

My name is Alfa and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Constellation Brands Second Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin your conference.", "Patty Yahn-Urlaub - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Thank you, Alfa. Good morning everyone and welcome to Constellation's second quarter fiscal year 2008 conference call. I am here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer.", "By now you should have had an opportunity to read our news release, which has also been furnished to the SEC. This conference call is intended to complement the release. During the call, we will discuss financial information on a GAAP, comparable, organic, and constant currency basis. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com under the Investors section.", "These reconciliations include explanations as to why management uses the non-GAAP financial measures and why management believes they are useful to investors. Discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results, excluding acquisition-related costs, restructuring and related charges, and unusual items. We will also discuss organic net sales information, which is defined in the news release and constant currency net sales information, which excludes the impact of year-over-year currency exchange rate fluctuation.", "Please be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company's estimates please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings.", "Thank you, and now I would like turn the call over to Rob.", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", ": Thanks Patty and good morning everybody. Welcome to our discussion of Constellation's second quarter.", "Before we get started, I want to officially welcome Mark Zupan to Constellation's Board of Directors. Mark is currently Dean of the Simon Graduate School of Business at the University of Rochester. His previous teaching assignments included Harvard, Dartmouth, USC and the University of Arizona. Mark has a Bachelor's degree from Harvard and a Ph. D. in Economics from MIT and I am really looking forward to working with Mark.", "And now I would like to discuss our financial performance for the second quarter of fiscal 2008. We're currently at the halfway mark for the year and are pleased with our progress-to-date which I believe provides the momentum required to achieve our full year goals.", "As anticipated, results for the quarter were impacted by a continuing competitive marketplace in the U. K. and Australia and our initiative to reduce distributor wine inventories in the U. S. As of the end of the second quarter, we estimate that the total sales impact for the distributor inventory reduction program was approximately $110 million, which was less than our initial estimate.", "Despite the lower sales impact, the EPS impact was $0.15, which was at the low end of our targeted range of 15% to 20%, as the mix of reduced distributor inventories was of higher margin premium products than we originally anticipated. This program is now substantially complete, as we are within the range of our goal in terms of targeted average number of days in distributor inventories.", "From a market perspective, the momentum continues around our wine premiumization efforts with solid marketplace sales growth contributed during the quarter by brands such as Woodbridge, Nobilo and Estancia as reported in recent U. S. IRI data.", "I also want to take this opportunity to provide an update relating to the U. S. grape harvest which is underway as we speak and is expected to continue through the end of October. While we expect this year's harvest to produce high quality output due to a mild dry growing season, we are estimating that the 2007 U. S. industry harvest may potentially decline in the mid-single digit range from last year's harvest. As it appears that overall pricing for grapes is moving up a bit reflecting a decrease in yields and tightening supply for key varietals such as Pinot Noir, Pinot Grigio and Chardonnay with fairly stable prices for generic wine varietals.", "Overall the U. S. wine market is very healthy and indications are that overall supply and demand should generally remain in balance. Our Canadian wine business posted an excellent quarter. Jackson-Triggs, the number one brand in Canada posted double-digit volume and sales growth, partially as a result of strong sales across Canada of the Jackson-Triggs Esprit wine which is our Olympic co-branded product launched in June. We also released the 2006 vintage for our Inniskillin Icewine which we believe ranks as one of the best ice wine vintages we've have ever seen.", "Turning to the U. K., the market conditions in the U. K. have not changed significantly during the quarter. As you know the 2007 Australia grape harvest came in approximately 30% lower than the 2006 grape crush.", "Severe drought conditions continue to affect the area with the key wine producing regions of Australia currently experiencing rainfall levels that have been less than 50% of normal. As I mentioned in the first quarter, these conditions are expected to reduce the output of the 2008 harvest, although we can't be specific on the magnitude of the reduction at this time, as the rainy season in Australia will continue through late October.", "Due to the lower harvest in 2007, the Australian bulk wine market has begun to dry up. There is currently limited availability of bulk wine for production of low cost private label Australian wines selling in the U. K. However, U.K. market pricing has not changed significantly as the wine market overall remains quite competitive.", "Despite challenging market conditions in the U. K., we continue to increase marketing support behind our premium wine brands. We are focused on improving our go market model and are working to improve our operating efficiencies. Although we remain cautious, we believe the tightening Australian wine supply and some indication of trading-up activity in the U. K. marketplace are positive trends.", "The Matthew Clark joint venture with Punch Taverns which provides wholesale services to the U. K. on-premise channel continues to progress and perform within expectations despite the U. K.'s rainiest summer weather conditions in recent memory and the implementation of a smoking ban during the quarter.", "In the Spirits segment, the strong marketplace momentum from SVEDKA Vodka continues with the posting of strong double-digit growth year-to-date. From an operational transition perspective, SVEDKA integration is essentially complete. We are beginning to build on the strength of the brand with enhanced distribution capabilities through national accounts and the export channel. And we are capitalizing on and channeling our strength with retailers in the wine channels to benefit our spirits business.", "The base spirits business is continuing to benefit from the premiumization trend occurring in the market and are focused on building our premium investment in priority growth brands including 1792 Ridgemont Reserve bourbon, the 99 Schnapps family, Meukow Cognac and recently launched new products.", "Moving to the Crown Imports joint venture. During the quarter, we were able to bring distributor inventories more into balance after working through challenges resulting from marketplace conditions prior to the formation of Crown. From a market perspective, Crown implemented a price increase for its Modelo beer portfolio earlier this year. As is typical with the price increase, we continue to experience a short-term retraction in imported beer volumes in the IRI channel. One that correlates very closely with the volume trends we experienced when we implemented a similar price increase in 2004. At that time, the negative volume trends reversed gradually over a number of months, and we expect that trend to repeat itself going forward. Crown maintains that this strategic pricing initiative is the right long-term decision for the Modelo portfolio of brands, despite a competitive market in the short term.", "Lastly, some of you may be aware that there is an ongoing tight supply of glass bottles on an industry wide basis due to various glass industry factors as well as continued strong wine and spirits industry growth resulting in decreased capacity worldwide. Although, we are experiencing some impact from this situation, it has been fully contemplated in our full year EPS guidance.", "In closing, we continue to execute on our strategy despite headwinds from marketplace dynamics and business initiatives. We are entering our strongest seasonal period and are well positioned to achieve our goals for next year.", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Bob Ryder for a financial review of the quarter. Bob?", "Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks Rob. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. Similar to our first quarter, in the second quarter we had several items which impacted the comparability of results including the Svedka acquisition, the Crown and Matthew Clark wholesale joint ventures and our new shift to reduce distributor inventories in the U. S.", "In general, I am pleased with our results for the quarter as we substantially completed our distributor inventory reduction initiatives, continued efforts to better position our U. K. and Australian businesses, improved performance and delivered solid cash flow which helped us reduce our debt by more than $200 million from first quarter levels.", "I would like start with a review of our P&L for the quarter where my comments will focus on comparable basis financial results. Commentary for net sales comparisons will be on a constant currency basis.", "Let's take a look at our net sales line. As you can see from our new release on page 13, our consolidated net sales decreased 39% reflecting a 1% benefit from the Svedka acquisition which was more than offset by the move of the U. S. imported beers to the Crown Imports joint venture and the U. K. wholesale business, the Matthew Clark joint venture. As previously discussed, these joint ventures follow equity accounting and are not reflected on the consolidated net sales line.", "We experienced a 1% decrease in consolidated organic net sales for the quarter which was primarily driven by our efforts to reduce distributor wine inventories in the U. S., which is now substantially complete. After excluding an estimated $110 million of net sales impact for this initiative for the first half of the year, we estimate that organic net sales growth would have been in line with our long-term target of mid single digits.", "We estimate that the EPS impact for this program during the first half of the year was approximately $0.15. Despite the lower than anticipated sales impact, the estimated EPS impact came in at the low end of our previous guided range. As Rob said, this was mostly due to greater destocking of higher margin premium products.", "Sprits net sales increased 25% due to the acquisition of Svedka and an 11% increase in organic net sales driven by higher average selling prices and volume gains. We are quite happy with Svedka as it continued to perform within our expectations and generated strong growth over the first half of the year.", "Worldwide branded wine net sales decreased 1%. This reflects the benefit of reporting sales of our wines, the Matthew Clark joint venture which were previously sold through our U. K. wholesale business offset by a 3% decrease in organic net sales.", "In our presentation of branded wine organic sales growth, we have added back $15 million of U. K. branded wine net sales in Q2 fiscal 2007, previously sold through the 100% owned U. K. wholesale business. We feel this approach provided a better reflection of organic sales performance. The add-back for Q1 fiscal 2007 totaled $7 million and is included in the year-to-date data presented.", "Turning our attention to branded wine geographic net sales on page 12 of the release, you will see branded wine net sales for North America decreased 4% as strong growth in Canada was more than offset by the impact of our efforts to reduce U. S. distributor wine inventories. For Europe, branded wine organic net sales increased 4%, reflecting increased sales of popular priced wine in mainland Europe and a slight increase in sales in the U. K. Our Australian, New Zealand branded wine organic net sales decreased 7%. Our New Zealand portfolio continues to perform well but the markets in the U. K. and Australia remain highly competitive with ongoing pricing pressures.", "Now we will look at our profits for the quarter on a comparable basis using information presented on page 14 of the news release. For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 35.2%, up 5.4 percentage points. This primarily reflects the benefits of shifting the lower margin U. K. wholesale and imported beer businesses to joint venture structures subject to equity accounting, somewhat offset by a temporary mix shift in the U. S. due to the distributor wine inventory reduction and lower margins for U. K. branded wine.", "Our consolidated SG&A for the quarter was 21.2% of net sales compared with 13.1% a year ago. This increase was primarily due to moving the imported beer and U. K. wholesale businesses to joint venture structures, the de-leveraging impact of the distributor inventory reductions in the U. S., higher brand marketing support for branded wine in the U. K. and U. S., and increased stock compensation expense.", "Consolidated operating income decreased to $125 million from $237 million for the prior year quarter. This change was primarily driven by the factors already mentioned, combined with reporting $79 million of equity earnings for the Crown JV compared to the second quarter last year when $74 million of earnings for imported beer business was included in operating income. This year-over-year increase in beer business profitability reflects increased pricing and the economic benefits of having a national platform for the Modelo portfolio.", "Now I would like to turn to our segment operating income results which are reflected on page 11 of the release. Wine segment operating income decreased $39 million to $125 million. This was primarily due to the lower net sales associated with the efforts to reduce U. S. distributor inventories and U. K. and Australian business performance, partially offset by an increase in profits from our Canadian business.", "For the Spirits segment, operating income increased $3 million, primarily due to the contribution from Svedka and higher sales from the base business, offset somewhat by higher material costs.", "For the quarter, corporate and other expenses totaled $21 million compared with $18 million for the prior year. The increase includes additional stock compensation expense and costs to support the growth of the company.", "Moving back to page 14, interest expense for the quarter was $87 million, up 20% over last year. The increase primarily reflects the incremental interest from funding the Svedka acquisition and $500 million of share repurchase.", "At the end of August, our debt totaled $4.7 billion, a decrease of more than $200 million from the Q1 level. At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $2.4 billion of bank debt and $2.3 billion of fixed term and other debt. With interest rate swaps that are in place through to the end of fiscal 2010, approximately 70% of our debt is effectively fixed rate.", "We had approximately $850 million of revolving credit available under our senior facility at the end of Q2. This, combined with our strong capital base and free cash flow generation ability, provides flexibility to fund further growth.", "Our comparable basis tax rate for the quarter came in at 34.7% versus 36.9% last year. This rate was somewhat lower than our previously anticipated rate for the quarter primarily due to favorable legislative changes in various state and foreign tax jurisdictions. As a result, we now expect our comparable basis tax rate for fiscal 2008 to approximate 37% versus our previous guidance of 38%.", "Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding totaled 219 million compared to 240 million last year reflecting the benefit from our share repurchase during this year.", "During the second quarter, the company received an additional 933,000 shares under the accelerated share repurchase transaction announced in May. We were not required to make any additional cash payment in connection with receipt of these shares which completed this transaction.", "For the first half of '08, the company purchased 21.3 million shares of its Class A common stock through a combination of open market repurchases and an accelerated share repurchase program at an aggregate cost of $500 million or an average of $23.44 per share. Due to the main factors just mentioned, diluted EPS decreased to $0.35 versus $0.43 last year.", "Now let's turn to cash flow on page 10. For purposes of this discussion free cash flow is defined as net cash flow provide by operating activities less CapEx. For the first six months of fiscal '08, we generated $130 million... $131 million of free cash flow versus a $22 million usage in the prior year. The year-over-year increase reflects a lower cash use for net working capital during the first half of fiscal '08 due in part from lower net sales and accounts receivable associated with the U. S. distributor inventory reduction.", "In addition, CapEx totaled $47 million for the first six months versus $103 million last year which included expenditures for our New Zealand vineyard expansion. Our free cash flow guidance for the year remains unchanged at $160 million to $180 million.", "As in previous years, in Q3 we fund the North American harvest activities and build working capital to meet seasonal business demand. Q4 is expected to provide strong cash flow generation which has been the case historically.", "Now let's summarize Q2 and discuss our full year guidance.", "From an earnings perspective, we are pleased with our results. Excluding the expected positive and negative impacts on our results from our various strategic initiatives, we believe that net sales growth through the first half of the year is in line with our long-term stated goals. We will continue to closely monitor the Australian harvest dynamics and the potential marketplace impacts. The U. K. market remains a difficult environment but what we believe we're making progress with the initiatives we have in place designed to improve future performance.", "Moving to our P&L expectations for the full year 2008, we're revising our comparable basis diluted EPS outlook to $1.34 to $1.42. This is from our previous range of $1.30 to $1.40. The increase reflects the benefit of the anticipated lower tax rate I mentioned earlier. This guidance excludes the acquisition-related integration costs, restructuring-related charges and unusual items, which are detailed on page 16 of the news release. Additional assumptions for our full year fiscal 2008 guideline are outlined on page 4 of the release.", "Before we take your questions, I want to make you aware that we have recently filed a preliminary proxy statement relating to special stockholders meeting, and I would like to briefly frame in this activity for you. The meeting has been called in response to a situation created by recent changes in U. S. tax laws. Under these new rules, the dividend rights of our Class A common stock could potentially create additional income tax expense and accelerate the timing of tax expense for stock option recipients in the U. S. These changes would significantly reduce the benefit that actual recipients receive without reducing costs associated with the option program.", "In response to this situation, we have proposed to create a new class of common stock and amend our long-term stock incentive plan to permit granting of awards with respect the new class of stock to preserve the tax treatment of stock option that was applicable prior to the new rules. These actions require shareholder approval.", "Finally, I want to emphasize that these proposed actions will not affect the underlying economic of the company's stock option program and will not increase the aggregate number of shares available for granting awards under the stock incentive plan.", "With that, we are happy to take your questions.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from Bonnie Herzog of Citi Investments. Please go ahead.", "Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup Smith Barney", "Good morning everyone.", "Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hey Bonnie.", "Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup Smith Barney", "I just had a few quick questions. I guess first of all given the Australian grape supply issue that we are all very well aware of and you discussed. I'd be curious to hear how much of your supply has grown by company-owned vineyards versus how much do you actually purchase on the open markets? Hello.", "Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good question, Bonnie.", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Bonnie, the vast majority of what we... of our grape supply in Australia is purchased on the open market.", "Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup Smith Barney", "It is open. That's what I... okay. Just wanted to verify that.", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Open but under contract.", "Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup Smith Barney", "Okay, and how long are the contracts?", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "They vary...", "Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup Smith Barney", "Vary...", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "In some cases, they are relatively long term.", "Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup Smith Barney", "Okay. Long term meaning 3 years 5?", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Multiple years.", "Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup Smith Barney", "All right. And then just turning over to your beer business. I was just curious if you could just provide a little bit more color on how you think it performed overall this quarter. And I am curious if the disruptions to the East Coast business have been resolved in your view and also trying to understand the performance in the East Coast versus the West Coast, whichever metric you would like to share with us, let it be volume pricing, income, that will be helpful.", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I think that in general, while the beer business has performed in accordance with our expectations, as you know we took a price increase at the beginning of the year, what we've seen as a result of that is very much in line with exactly what we've seen when we take in price increases. So there's really nothing different there than what we would have expected to occur. And as I said in my talk we expect to see that to start to rebound. As we also have mentioned previously, there were some high inventories when we took over the East and therefore during the first half we have now brought those inventories back into line. And then with respect to your question about East versus West...", "Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup Smith Barney", "Right.", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think we are seeing some very positive trends in the short term, the last reporting periods for IRI and things to that effect... in the East in particular. So we are optimistic about how we're performing in that regard.", "Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup Smith Barney", "Okay, good. And then just a quick final question just in terms of the currency, the translation, helping your earnings this quarter. Can you quantify that in terms of the impact to your EPS?", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes we... it's not significant Bonnie.", "Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup Smith Barney", "Okay.", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We actually hedge most of that away.", "Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup Smith Barney", "All right. But I was under the impression, I am sorry, that impacted your top line by several percentage points?", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "It's about two percentage points.", "Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup Smith Barney", "Okay.", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think if you know... if you go through some of the footnotes in the press release...", "Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup Smith Barney", "Thank you.", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think that works out.", "Bonnie Herzog - Citigroup Smith Barney", "All right, I appreciate your time.", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Lauren Torres of HSBC. Please go ahead.", "Lauren Torres - HSBC", "Good morning. Just a quick clarification, First Rob, you mentioned that you substantially completed the reduction, the inventory reduction in the quarter. By the word substantially, I guess it does assume or allow us to assume there is still more to come. And if you could give us a sense... if there is how much, is more to come?", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, the reason we used the word substantially is because there always can be some fluctuations in the short term in distributor inventory. For your purposes, I think you should consider it complete and there... any changes in distributor inventory which as I said really shouldn't be anything significant are fully taken into account in the guidance that we've given you.", "Lauren Torres - HSBC", "And that's why you are giving us that $0.15 number, kind of stick with that and that's what...", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "The $0.15 is where we've ended up with the distributor inventory reduction, that's what you should stick with, exactly.", "Lauren Torres - HSBC", "Okay and I guess to a question for Bob. In the quarter, it does look like you had some good free cash flow growth. I am just wondering why maybe... I maybe, you are not getting a bit more optimistic on guidance for the full year?", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes it's a good question and basically, we are pretty happy with our free cash generation in the first half. But from the cash flow perspective, we are so early in the year. I mean last year we were negative at this point. And as we entered the back half for the year, especially the third quarter, the inventory distribution program is behind us, and we expect to build up some decent working capital in the back half for the year. So I would say we are cautiously optimistic on cash flow but not optimistic enough to change the guidance right now.", "Lauren Torres - HSBC", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Tim Ramey of D. A Davidson, please go ahead.", "Timothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co. ", "Good morning. A couple of follow ups. One on the hedging expense. Where exactly are you booking that... has that pushed down to segment operating income?", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. All the hedging, I think is booked down. It is pushed down to the operating income. So it's sort of invisible to you guys. I mean, if you look at the statements, I might have misstated the number a little bit but I think in the wine segments ForEx helped us about 4% on net sales. Right because that's all in the... in our net sales breakout in the background. So when we hedge translation, we are hedging the EBIT impact of it, not in that net sales impact of.", "Timothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co. ", "Got it. And on the inventory reduction program, why did it end up being less, end up being smaller than originally forecast? Was that due to strong consumer movement or did you just kind of back away from the program a bit, what changed?", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Tim, it was really a mix impact. The mix of the reduced inventory was skewed towards the higher margin products and therefore the sales impact was lower than expected. But the earnings impact was within the range that we specified, and we accomplished in general the goal that we were trying to accomplish in terms of what we took out. So it was really the sales and the sales was a function of the mix being towards lower volume, higher margin items.", "Timothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co. ", "Okay. And I think you mentioned that Svedka was running at double digits. Do you have a current case sales run rate that you could share? Or what it's actually done in case sales year-over-year in terms of percent change?", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "First half of the year, it's been running very much in accordance with our expectations, very high double digits in the 50 percentage type growth rate. And it's a great brand, and it's performing exactly as we'd like it to be. We're extremely happy with it.", "Timothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co. ", "Okay. And any other wine brands that you would highlight in terms of scan [ph] the data that are either particularly bad or particularly good?", "Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well there is nothing particularly bad, but...", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Our premium portfolio continues to perform well. We continue to see very strong... I should say strong growth in major brands like Robert Mondavi private selection, Toasted Head, Rex Goliath. We are very pleased with our growth. We have to remember that our premium wine portfolio is a very large portfolio. We are the largest and we look for strong growth in that portfolio, and we are getting it.", "Timothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co. ", "Sounds good. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Hi everyone. At first just in terms of the depletion numbers are you wiling to give us the depletion numbers for U. S. wine and the Crown Imports?", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We don't normally talk depletions. With Crown, we said that we did reduce some distributor inventories throughout the first half. We brought those down. That's really the only relevant news relative to depletions. In general, our depletions and shipments are basically equal, so it's really not important to talk about depletions independently unless there's something to highlight. That's how we have discussed this in the past.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "So, if we go back to your comment about the organic net sales in the first half being up in line with your long-term guidance excluding the impact of distributor inventory situation in the U. S. We take that and thank that its depletions are up in that range as well.", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And then secondly, I just wanted to sort of broadly look at the global wine supply situation. Obviously we are hearing that the Australian harvest is likely to come in much below last year's harvest. It looks like the U. S. is going to be down this year as well. If you sort of look out... kind of looking at the global wine situation, are we... do you think we are entering a point where the supply is becoming tighter and that really creates a more conducive pricing environment for your wines and sort of what's the implication from a pricing standpoint as you look in the U. S. wine market and the U. K. wine market?", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes I think that in answer to your question, we certainly see supplies around the world beginning to tighten, and there has been quite a bit of press about precisely what you are suggesting that we might be turning from global over supply to global under supply. I will say that having been in this industry for many, many years, those exact turning points are extremely difficult to predict, but certainly some of those indications are there.", "And then to your sort of second point in that regard, if in fact, we're at one of those inflection points, or moving into one of those inflection points, that should be a positive trend, that should be positive as it relates to pricing trends. Again, we are not predicting anything at this stage relative to our business specifically. But the kind of things that you are talking about could very well be the case on a macro basis. So, everything as I said would be a positive trend.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "At what point would you be willing to, sort of think that we are at that inflection point? Is it when the Australian harvest does indeed come in significantly below last year's number and the U. S. is also short? Do you have to see more balanced situation coming out of Chile and other markets around the world, sort of what are kind of the milestones that we should be looking out?", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think that as you said that the Southern Hemisphere harvest coming up and then the next Northern Hemisphere harvest at the end of next summer that should give us some better indications of exactly where we are at. Remember as I said this is a very big macro trend, it's not measured in any particular instant and time. You can't make gross overstatements about it based on one harvest or another harvest. It's going to take a few harvests and it should become more evident as I said, after the next two Northern and Southern Hemisphere harvests.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, thank you.", "Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Bill Leach of Neuberger Berman. Please go ahead.", "William Leach - Neuberger Berman", "Hi good morning. Maybe you said it but can you tell us exactly how much the beer volume was down at Crown and how much you raised prices?", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, I don't think that we did... that we did say that.", "Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes I think if you... you can get that off it right if you look but remember that's just sort of microcosmic in total. You will see sales growth ahead of volume growth.", "William Leach - Neuberger Berman", "Okay. Can you just tell us the number?", "Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I don't remember it off the top of my head.", "William Leach - Neuberger Berman", "I mean was it like mid single digits, I mean?", "Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I think that's close to right, it was around mid-single digit price increase.", "William Leach - Neuberger Berman", "And the volume was down mid single digit too?", "Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I don't remember the volume frankly. I think it was lower, it wasn't down that low.", "William Leach - Neuberger Berman", "So their revenues were actually up?", "Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It's probably down low single digits.", "William Leach - Neuberger Berman", "Okay.", "Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And asRob said there is a pattern to this, at least in the beer business as to how the volume growth wanes after you take a price increase and how it gradually comes back over time as retailers and consumers suggest to it.", "William Leach - Neuberger Berman", "But we can say that volume was down low single digits in the quarter?", "Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And again, as you know we don't consolidate Crown. So that doesn't flow through our financials.", "William Leach - Neuberger Berman", "Right. But that obviously impacts your equity income. So, we need to know how it helps the businesses.", "Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. I just don't remember the volume thing, if you look at the... and again, it's year-over-year, because last year we were just West Coast, we didn't have complete visibility into what the East Coast volumes did last year, East Coast sales did last year. So, unfortunately it's not a real roadmap.", "William Leach - Neuberger Berman", "Okay. And looks like the stock compensation expenses are about $0.03 a share. Is that right?", "Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That seems high to me. Bill, as you know, what we did is, we changed the option program and this will be featuring into our P&L over four years. And this is the second of fourth year, second of four years that you will see increased stock compensation expense and I think it was closer to a penny.", "William Leach - Neuberger Berman", "Are you sure that, from 6 months it's almost $17 million pre-tax versus $7.8 million last year, it's a big increase?", "Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That's year-to-date numbers. Are you talking the quarter or you...", "William Leach - Neuberger Berman", "Yes, well. I like to know the quarter.", "Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The quarter is about a penny.", "William Leach - Neuberger Berman", "A penny, okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jonathan Feeney of Wachovia Securities. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, good morning. This is actually, Brian Skedery [ph] on behalf of Jon Feeney. In regards to distributor inventory reduction, I was wondering if you could give us any color on what types of safeguards and/or kind of consumer data that you have put in place to prevent this problem from like recurring in the future.", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, you know there is really not a need for any safeguards. The key is over a longer range period that shipments and depletion should be somewhat equal and that's largely in our control. So we monitor that, and we don't expect to take... as I said the medium term or long term distributor inventory is up, now there are fluctuations from time to time. As we have said in the past, you might see for instance, in the quarter leading up to a holiday season, it's necessary to build some inventories because we have sales growth during those periods and then in periods that are not as fast, you might see some inventories going down but generally depletions and shipments are equal.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great. And just one more on the joint venture front.", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sorry. Sorry I am sorry, what was that?", "Unidentified Analyst", "That's all right. Just one more on the joint venture front particularly Matthew Clark wholesale sale business you know. How is that working out? I mean essentially you have partnered with a customer. So does that close the door to others or like does that particularly... does that particular JV like change the go to market any way that limits you?", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Number one, they were not a big customer. And the direct answer to your question is, no it really doesn't limit us. That marketplace is... let me just put it a little differently. We sell to thousands and thousands... tens of thousands of different outlets. What they buy is largely a function of price and service and they are not particularly concerned with corporate ownership structures. They are concerned as I said with the price and the service they are getting for the products that they are purchasing. So it's really not a factor in dealing with our tens and tens of thousands of customers around the country.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Christine Farkas of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you very much. I would like to start with spirits trends if I could. We've heard some anecdotal evidence that perhaps the low end of the market is getting hurt but the high end of course is trading up. Your organic growth is pretty strong. Can you just give me a little bit of sense of mix and what's growing and what isn't?", "Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes this is Bob. I would say for the quarter, we experienced some positive mix shift. So what you are saying is pretty correct that the low-end of the market is not going as fast as the upper end of the market and our higher price-per-bottle brands which also carry higher profits with them, are growing faster than the lower price-per-bottle brands, in the wine business.", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "But on that given your organic growth up 11%, on how much of your portfolio would you consider low end versus high end now?", "Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It's probably about 50:50.", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. That means pretty strong growth at the high end, I guess with some of the innovation that you've out there?", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes this is Rob. It's actually a little bit less than that. It's somewhat less than that, but we do have very strong growth in the high end, and that is causing the mix shift.", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay great. Moving to Canada, good growth in that market. I am just wondering, and perhaps this might be looking a little bit over analytical at the market, but with the strong dollar, are there fewer imports going into Canada that might perhaps allow your domestic brands to thrive even more? Is there any of that going on in Canada?", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Actually the imports business in Canada is very strong, as well as the domestic business and remember imports into Canada are coming from a lot of different places like Australia, like Chile.", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Sure.", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "And like the U. S. I don't think that we have really seen the... well in general the import business has been strong, and it has not been hurting the domestic. It hasn't been hurting the domestic business, which has also remained strong.", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay.", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "In particular the premium end of the market what we call VQA, which are entirely produced in Canada products. They also remain very strong. So really both the ends of the market are good.", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. So well that's good, it's not hurting your business. Well your exports from California to Canada, has that gone up?", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Our exports. I am sorry what did you say?", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Your exports from California for example into Canada. Does your business benefit based on your strong base in distribution in Canada?", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Our exports have been. Fine but remember we export to Canada from a number of our different wine producing regions, like Australia and I'll also point out that Vincor has a strong import business as well as a strong domestic business. So we're really positioned to take advantage of all the positive trends.", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay.", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Both imports and the domestic.", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just on Australia again similarly with Australian supplies potentially drying up here and the Australian segment really dominating that $5 to $9 price point. I am wondering if either your forecast or even existing trend so far, would your own brands in the 5 to 9 segment, like a Woodbridge for example be in a better position? Should those supplies just really flow into North America?", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. I would say the answer to that is yes. Even now I would also say that Woodbridge is performing exceptionally well given that it's a huge brand, it's the biggest brand in the category and segment though we are seeing some good growth for a brand that size. So even without imports being hurt or Australian imports being particularly hurt we're seeing strong Woodbridge growth as we sit here. But clearly what you suggested could be the case as well.", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, that's helpful. And sorry last quick one on SG&A. You mentioned stock compensation up and marketing up in terms of some brand spend but also SG&A higher based on I guess the transition or destocking. Can you quantify how much of that SG&A increase is considered more one time in nature in the quarter?", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think that the SG&A increase is due to the change in equity accounting of our major segments of Crown and Matthew Clark. So I think that's what you are really seeing there. It's why SG&A has become a larger percentage of net sales as we eliminated it from the net sales line, the businesses that we are now accounting for in the equity method.", "Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So I would say that there is not any one-time absolute dollar cost in there, it's just that as a percentage of sales. As Rob said that the geography has changed because we took so many sales out because of the JV accounting.", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Kaumil Gajrawala [ph] of UBS. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you. A couple of things. First thing on the distributor inventory issue. Now that you have gone through it, can you talk a little bit about distributor support and investment behind the brands? I remember when you first announced the program, one of the intentions were to create some working capital for the distributor levels that they can support your brands more. And I just wonder if you can give us an update on that.", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think that having the intended result, we're working well with our distributors. We are a very large supplier. The distributor inventory reduction has benefited them, and they are very willing to partner with us to continue to build our brands and our portfolios. And that was really the whole idea behind the whole thing. So I think we are very positive in that regard and our partnership remains very strong in that regard.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And so I think incrementally is the support higher than it was?", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, it's a huge, we have thousands and thousands of distributors and it's hard to make that kind of a judgment because it's something that's constantly in flux. And there's all sorts of mix and so on and so forth. But we had... as I said are getting good distributor support against our growth initiatives. So, I think it's working.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Thanks and then on the Crown side, how much are you relying or do you expect the domestic brewers to begin to take some pricing this fall in order to... ticket volumes to start to pick up again at... in the Modelo portfolio?", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We are not relying on anything. We are not privy to what the domestic brewers are going to do and when they are going to do it. There is already anecdotal evidence that there's pricing being taken in the marketplace, reading all the typical trend price and so on and so forth. So, we think that, that's happening which is fairly consistent with the patterns of the past, when the high end takes a pricing, usually the lower end falls after a certain period of time. So, the anecdotal evidence is that's the case.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, got it and then a last thing. You talked about no changes in the business in the U. K. yet your organic number, Europe branded wine seemed to be fairly strong when you adjust the wholesale. So can you talk a little bit what... where the growth is there and where it's coming from?", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, well as of in the first half, particularly in the first quarter we had some very strong growth. Little less on the second quarter and it's been coming from mainland Europe. We've been... we're really not over-emphasizing that because a lot of it has come from... some of the growth has come from... I will say lower margin product that we've sold in mainland Europe. So it's not necessarily flowing through to the bottom-line in a big way. So I think that's basically the answer to your question. Volumes in general and our U. K. and Europe business are not... this is a double negative, are not unhealthy. In other words they are healthy but we do... it is a competitive market. There continues to be pricing and margin issues. We continue to work through that, and we are at best cautiously optimistic about the... our recovery plans there.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Thanks operator. Good morning guys. Rob, on this destocking and then couple of financial questions for you Bob. I want to make sure I am piecing the pieces together properly here. It sounds like you are basically saying that at the distributor level you're simply leaving inventory that are higher level than you originally anticipated because you are not in fact seeing a material pickup in depletion rates out of those distributors which might be a very sound business decision. But I am just trying to understand ultimately what drove this $1.10 versus $1.60 or higher.", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "No that is not right, Mark. We met our goals at the distributor level. The reason that the dollar sales number is lower than the range that we gave is because of the mix impact towards lower volume, lower volume higher margin products what we had said originally that we were targeting about a 25% to 30% reduction in days. And as we've looked sort of a market by market, distributor by distributor, product by product, we have accomplished those goals. So, we have accomplished the goal that we have set forth.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, but higher... I guess we can move on, but higher margin?", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Based on lower volume, higher margin products, right.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "But lower right. So that means even less absolute volume was taken out of your distributors. But it is what it is. Just in terms of financial items, Bob, I might have missed it but it's... as it relates to fiscal... looking beyond fiscal '08 in the past, you guys have said that you think fiscal '07 has an earnings base you expect to return over the medium to long term to high single digit to low double digit EPS growth. And I might have missed it in your prepared remarks but is that still your view?", "Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, I think that's true. But why you think our remarks are prepared, this is all... this is all unscripted. Yes, we are not obviously we are not talking about next year yet but nothing we see this year would be changing. What we said historically about long term trends in the business is still an extremely healthy category.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, great. And then lastly just on fiscal '08 as you look at your share count assumptions, you are saying 225 million for the year you had about... you did 219.3 in the quarter. So that seems to... that 225 implies fairly meaningful pickup in the second half.", "Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I think it's a weighted average thing, the way the EPS is calculated. So I think it's done on a year-to-date basis. So you had a higher share count sort of in the front-end of the year.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Right, but I am saying if you take the 219 and the higher number for the first quarter and then if you just take 219 and hold it constant for the balance of the year, you are more like 223 I think for the full year. So that basically implies, you are expecting to go up then again in the second half.", "Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I thinkit will be mostly just how the option dilution kicks in to the calculation. Because I mean obviously, we are not... we don't plan to issue or buy back any more shares.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Excellent. Okay, that's what I thought. Thanks very much.", "Operator", ": Thank you. Our final question is coming from Bryan Spillane of Banc of America Securities. Please go ahead.", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America", "Hey good morning everybody.", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi Bryan.", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America", "Just a few points. One, a point of clarification. Are the... that the distributor inventory correction or drawdown for Crown is all... is completed, right? You are not... the Crown is not in a position where they are still de-stocking wholesaler inventories, is that correct?", "Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Correct.", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America", "Okay, and then second", "Robert Ryder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And I am not taking into account short-term fluctuations, but in general that's correct.", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America", "Okay and then, the second point is, Rob if you could talk a bit about looking into the holidays in the U. K., are your... is your participation in promotions with retailers, so sort of what's on your holiday merchandising calendar this year. Any different than last year and I guess what I am trying to drive at is, you expect that your shelf space, your display space, and the number of promotion activities this year to be on par with, greater than or less than last year.", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. Well we don't know that until after the holiday unfortunately but a lot of the process of going into the holidays, and it's all about working out our promotional programs with the major retailers. And based on what I am hearing, we are being very successful in getting our holiday promotions locked away, and I am hoping for a better holiday season in that regard than we had last year, which was not necessarily, particularly negative or otherwise, but our portfolio is a good portfolio. The market is not... it's fairly strong, and what I am hearing is that the retailers are favorable towards what we are doing. And so I am looking forward to a good holiday season in terms of promotional activity. So I don't see anything negative in any respect on the horizon in that regard, Bryan.", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America", "Okay, great. Thanks guys.", "Robert Sands - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Okay. Well thanks for joining our call today. And I would characterize this quarter as one of continued execution toward our goals. We delivered solid cash performance and paid down debt. We substantially completed our U. S. wine distributor inventory reduction program. We are driving marketplace initiatives around the world which will help us drive growth from our portfolio of products. And from a financial perspective, we believe that we are well positioned to achieve our revised full year EPS goal and free cash flow targets.", "So thanks again everybody for your participation. Our next call is scheduled after the new years. So I am sure everybody will responsibly enjoy some of our excellent products during the upcoming holiday season. And I will talk to you all after that. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference.

My name is Bree and I\u2019ll be your conference operator today.  At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Constellation Brands fiscal 2008 earnings conference call.  (Operator instructions).  Thank you, it is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Patty Yahn-Urlaub, ma\u2019am, you may begin your conference.", "Patty Yahn-Urlaub", "", "Thank you Bree.  Good morning everyone and welcome to Constellation\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal year end 2008 conference call.  I\u2019m here this morning with Rob Sands our President and Chief Executive Officer and Bob Ryder our Chief Financial Officer.  By now you should have had an opportunity to read our news release which has also been furnished to the SEC.  This conference call is intended to compliment the release. ", "During the call we will discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable organic and constant currency basis. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company\u2019s website at www.cbrands.com under the investor section. These reconciliations include explanations as to why management uses the non GAAP financial measures and why management believes they are useful to investors.", "Discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results excluding acquisition related costs, restructuring and related charges and unusual items. We will also discuss organic net sales information which is defined in the news release and constant currency net sales information which excludes the impact of year over year currency fluctuations, currency exchange rate fluctuations.  Please be aware that we may make forward looking statements during this call.

And now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rob.", "Rob Sands", "", "Thanks Patty and good morning everybody and welcome to our call.  We have several items to discuss this morning, including our fiscal year 2008 results and our guidance for 2009.  As I look back on 2008, I would characterize it as the year of significant accomplishments.  We exceeded our key financial goals and achieved our strategic initiatives which most notably include premiumization of our brand portfolio, including the acquisitions of Svedka Vodka and the Fortune Brands US premium wine portfolio.  ", "We formed a joint venture with Punch Taverns in the UK in order to strengthen Matthew Clark\u2019s position as the UK\u2019s largest independent drinks wholesaler serving the entreed industry.  Although the Crown joint venture was formed in late fiscal 2007, Crown spent much of 2008 integrating the business and executing a smooth transition with the joint venture growing volume and profits across the Modello product portfolio.  We divested the low margin Almaden and Inglenook value wine brands which will enable us to enhance the growth, profitability and ROIC of our US wine portfolio.  ", "It also allows us to focus on the higher growth, higher margin premium wines within our portfolio.  As part of our wine acquisition activities, we re-aligned our US sales and marketing force in order to focus on specific consumer segment opportunities which include fine wine, premium wine and specialty value wines.  As part of this initiative we continue to rationalize our US wine product portfolio, primarily within the value segment.  This includes smaller low margin regional brands at price points generally less than $5.00.  ", "We are in the process of consolidating certain wine marketing operations in Australia in order to insure optimal asset utilization and produce greater efficiency from our global wine production infrastructure.  We completed our US wine distributor inventory reduction initiative.  Although it impacted sales and earnings for fiscal 2008, it was the right thing to do for the business as we achieved our objectives of creating supply chain efficiencies and enhancing our brand strength in the marketplace.  From a financial perspective, we exceeded our comparable earnings per share goal and achieved record free cash flow for the year.  ", "Overall, we are executing on our strategy and taking the appropriate actions to further position our business for success in the future.  We expect this momentum to continue throughout 2009.  And you\u2019ll see from our guidance that we are on a path to further strengthen the growth and profitability of our business.  And now I\u2019d like to discuss our business and financial performance for fiscal 2008.  My discussion today will primarily focus on full year results with the exception of the impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter reflecting business challenges experienced in the UK and Australia.  ", "And I\u2019d like to spend a minute providing a little bit more context around the impairment charges which are primarily related to our Hardy\u2019s business in Australia and the UK and then Bob Ryder will provide additional financial details about the charges.  Constellation acquired Hardy\u2019s in March 2003.  The strategy was to take a leading position in one of the most important appellations for new world wines.  Australia was and is considered a great source of quality wines at value prices.  ", "However, at that time, the Australian dollar was much weaker versus most major currencies, the wine industry was experiencing shortages of key varietals and the UK had not had a wine duty increase for three years.  Since then the Australian dollar has strengthened.  Australia had the three largest harvests in its history which created a surplus of wine and in the UK which is Hardy\u2019s largest market, the government implemented an annual duty increase beginning in April 2003.  So where do we stand now?  We have taken steps to improve profitability, operating efficiencies and our competitive position in both the UK and Australian markets.  In January we implemented a UK price increase to cover cost increases, but immediately implemented an additional price increase to cover the recently announced duty increase.  ", "Because we continue to invest in brand building in the UK, we are in a good position with retailers as we implement our pricing actions and we believe other suppliers are taking similar actions.  The UK remains one of the world\u2019s largest import wine markets, growing at a healthy rate of 7% on value in the multiple grocer channel per recent Nielsen data with Constellation\u2019s growth exceeding the market growth rate.  Overall, we believe the margin compression in the UK has bottomed, the market remains healthy and there is good momentum going forward.  ", "The Australian wine market is also healthy, growing at mid single digits on a value basis.  Australia is one of the largest exporters of new world wines and will continue to provide growth opportunities for Constellation going forward.  We believe these are strategically important markets and are beginning to see some positive signs of recovery.  I\u2019d also like to note that the UK and Australian markets combined currently represent less than 10% of our total company EBIT and we expect to improve our operating results from this level in 2009 and beyond.  ", "Moving to the US wine business.  We have undergone a major transformation in our US wine portfolio with divestiture of Almaden and Inglenook which represented 15-20% of our US wine volumes and the addition of the premium Fortune Brands, namely Clos du Bois, a super premium wine selling in the $8-$11 price category.  As you know the total portfolio of acquired products is well positioned among fast growing super premium plus wines, solidifying our position as an undisputed leader in the US premium wine business.  As a result of these portfolio changes, our value premium mix has changed dramatically.  ", "Our US portfolio is now comprised of approximately 30% value wines and 70% premium wines on a volume basis and about 15% value versus 85% premium on a dollar basis.  In addition, our portfolio rationalization initiative continues as we are discontinuing small regional value wine brands in the US.  The culmination of these activities will result in the US wine portfolio we believe will be well positioned to drive sales growth, margin expansion and improved ROIC.  ", "From a marketplace perspective, growth in the US premium wine market remains very healthy at about 9% on a dollar basis according to recent 12 week IRI data.  In particular, the super premium plus segment where wines sell for $8.00 and above at retail and where Constellation has a leading market share continues to grow at double digit rates exceeding the trends of the total US wine market.  ", "This segment includes Constellation Brands such as Estancia, Toasted Head, [see me] Robert Mondavi, Franciscan, Kim Crawford, Wild Horse and the newly acquired Clois du Bois brand.  We are also seeing evidence that strong trading up activities continue in the marketplace.  From an economic perspective, we are seeing some venue shift from on premise consumption to off premise consumption.  Within the off premise channel, we are also seeing some shift at discount retailers including large mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs.  ", "I\u2019d like to remind everyone that we remain generally insulated from the impact of these venue shifts because we sell directly to the distributor tier in the US at the same margin regardless of the end user consumption.  Our Canadian wine business posted strong results for the year, primarily driven by the premium wine portfolio including Jackson-Triggs, Sawmill Creek, Naked Grape and Inniskillin icewine products which all contributed double digit sales growth. ", " In the spirits segment, Svedka Vodka had a great year and generated phenomenal growth of greater than 40% versus calendar year 2006.  It is not only the fastest growing major imported premium vodka in the US but according to recent impact data, Svedka is the fastest growing major premium spirit in the world with a five year [kagger] of approximately 50%.  The base spirits business also contributed strong sales growth for the year driven by premium brands, including Black Velvet, Ridgemont Reserve 1792 Bourbon, the 99 Schnapps Family, recently launched new products and contributions from our production services business.  Overall, approximately 30% of our spirits sales are represented by our premium product portfolio.  Our premium spirits products are growing at the rate of 24% in the most recent 12 week IRI channels.  ", "Moving to Crown imports joint venture.  Calendar year 2007 was a transition year for crown as it completed its first full year of operation.  During the company\u2019s fiscal year 2008, the crown joint venture generated $2.4 billion in net sales and more than $500 million in operating income.  Crown has the leading market share in the import category in the US with 5 of the Modello brands represented in the top 20 import brands.  ", "Corona is the number one imported beer and Modello Especial is now the number three import.  As we\u2019ve previously indicated, volumes for the business have been impacted by price increases implemented at the end of calendar year 2006 and at the beginning of 2007.  In addition, the second half of our fiscal year was impacted by challenging year over year Crown comparisons as we prepared for the joint venture transition during the same timeframe the previous year.  ", "We are now beginning to lap this price increase for certain markets, but because of the staged nature of last year\u2019s price rollout, we will not fully lap the increase until we have completed the first quarter of our fiscal year 2009.  The good news is that in a number of markets where the pricing cycle has been completed, we are seeing a return to solid growth trends.  While we are cautiously optimistic some of our key markets like California have been particularly hard hit by the economic downturn.  ", "These markets will be a key focus for Crown as we move into the critical selling season.  On the other hand in markets like Texas and in the East, we have seen double digit volume growth return in 2008.  Going into the Cinco de Mayo holiday and the key summer selling season, Crown is well positioned to execute at retail with outstanding new creative and promotional materials and a strong fully staffed organization.  As a result, Crown is confident in its ability to achieve mid single digit depletion growth for fiscal 2009.  ", "Now before I turn the call over to our CFO Bob Ryder, I wanted to discuss our EPS guidance for fiscal 2009.  As you can see our EPS range of $1.68-$1.76 clearly shows progress from where we ended fiscal 2008 and demonstrates that we are committed to enhancing the growth and profitability of our business.  Our cash flow guidance also demonstrates a strong commitment to cash flow generation.  I will provide an overview relating to other future business objectives and initiatives when we get together for our May 29th investor meeting in New York.  And now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bob Ryder for a financial discussion of our business results.  Bob.", "Bob Ryder", "", "Thanks Rob, good morning everyone.  Overall I\u2019m pleased with our results for the year with comparable basis diluted EPS coming in at $1.44.  We effectively hit our operational P&L goals for the year end and experienced some positive tax rate adjustments which contributed to the outperformance on a comparable basis expectations.  I\u2019m especially pleased with our record free cash flow generation which exceeded our goals.  We are targeting another year of strong free cash flow generation in fiscal 2009.  ", "But from an operational perspective, we believe we have taken many significant steps during the past year to increase our profit generation profile and drive improved financial results in fiscal 09.  We believe our efforts throughout fiscal 2008 and our planned initiatives for fiscal 2009 better position our UK and Australian businesses for improved performance going forward.  In addition, we added faster growing super premium and luxury brands like Clois du Bois and Wild Horse with average selling prices and margins that are greater than our base portfolio.  ", "While also divesting lower price lower margin value brands like Almaden and Inglenook.  Before I review our fiscal 2008 results and our guidance for fiscal 2009, I would like to discuss the $874 million of charges recorded in Q4.  This amount is significant, however it is non-cash and has no impact on our debt covenants, our liquidity or our ability to execute our business strategies.  These charges primarily relate to goodwill and intangible assets impairments associated with the company\u2019s Australian and UK businesses in connection with the company\u2019s annual fourth quarter impairment testing under SFAS 142.  ", "As previously discussed, profits and cash flows for these businesses have been negatively impacted by competitive pricing pressures driven by the strength of the large grocery retailers, Australian wine oversupply and UK duty increases.  As a result of the lower profit trends associated with these businesses, our SFAS 142 test required us to recognize and impairment charge.  The charges primarily include goodwill and intangible impairments of around $800 million related to Australia and the UK and a $52 million Australian deferred tax asset valuation allowance.", "Now, let\u2019s look at our fiscal 2008 P&L performance where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results.  Let\u2019s look at the net sales line.  As you can see from our news release on page 15, our consolidated net sales decreased 28% reflecting the move of US imported beers to the Crown imports JV and the UK wholesale business to the Matthew Clark JV.  Sales were also impacted by our initiative to reduce distributor wine inventories in the US.  The growth rate was 5% after excluding the impact of acquisitions and joint ventures and 1% after adjusting for currency changes.  Excluding an estimated $110 million net sale impact for the reduction of the distributor wine inventories, we estimate organic net sales grew in the mid single digits.", "My remaining comments will be on a constant currency basis.  Worldwide branded organic net sales decreased 2%.  Please turn to page 14 of the release.  Organic branded wine geographic net sales for North America decreased 3% reflecting solid growth in Canada, more than offset by the impact of reducing US wine distributor inventory levels during the first half of the year.  As previously discussed, the goal of this initiative was to assure distributors have sufficient inventories to meet consumer demand but to reduce any permanent buffer stock in non peak periods.  This [drew] a timing change in our US wine sales pattern.  ", "After we completed the peak holiday selling season in the third quarter, we returned to the lower distributor inventory levels achieved at the end of Q2. This negatively impacted our Q4 rate.  Our underlying sales to retailers were well within our range of expectations of low to mid single digits growth, excluding divested brands.  For Europe, branded wine organic net sales increased 4% reflecting higher sales of popular priced wine to mainland Europe and a slight increase in net sales in the UK.  Our Australian New Zealand branded wine net sales decreased 2%.  Turning our attention to spirits, net sales increased 26% due to the Svedka acquisition and 9% increase in organic net sales driven primarily by higher average selling prices, an increase in our production services business and new products.  ", "Now, let\u2019s look at our profit on a comparable basis using information on page 17 of the release.  For the year our consolidated gross margin was 34.9%, up 4.9%.  This primarily reflects the benefits of shifting the lower margin UK wholesale and imported beer businesses to joint ventures which was somewhat offset by lower margin for the branded wine business in the UK and Australia and the impact of reducing distributor wine inventories in the US.  Our consolidated SG&A for the year was 20.4% of net sales compared with 13.8% a year ago.  ", "This increase was also primarily due to moving the imported beer and UK wholesale businesses to joint venture structures.  In addition, we saw increased management incentive expense due to low bonus accruals in the prior year and higher stock compensation expense for the transition effects related to SFAS 123R.  This year also included higher marketing support for branded wine in the UK.  Consolidated operating income decreased to $545 million from $843 million for the prior year.  ", "This change was primarily driven by the factors already mentioned combined with reporting $255 million of equity earnings for the Crown JV compared to last year when we recognized $39 million of equity earnings for Crown and $208 million of earnings for our imported beer business that was included in operating income.  Now I\u2019d like to turn to our segment operating income results on page 13 of the release.  The year over year increase in beer business profitability reflects increased pricing and economic benefits of having a national platform for the Modello portfolio.  ", "We saw lower total profit growth for the beer business in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year.  As previously discussed, this was primarily attributable to a high level of sales in the prior year third and fourth quarters as the business was preparing for the Crown transition.  Wine segment operating income decreased $72 million to $558 million.  This was primarily due to the lower net sales associated with the reduction of US distributor wine inventories and UK and Australia business performance.  For the spirits segment, operating income increased $7 million primarily due to the contribution from Svedka and higher sales for the base business, offset somewhat by higher material costs.  ", "For the year, corporate and other expenses totaled $86 million compared to $61 million for the prior year.  The increase includes additional management incentive and stock compensation expenses for the reasons I mentioned earlier.  And higher outside service and professional fees related to management reporting system enhancements and transactions.  Please turn to page 17 of the release.  Equity investment earnings totaled $274 million versus $53 million last year.  ", "Equity earnings for the year are comprised of $255 million from Crown and the remainder related substantial to Opus One.  Interest expense for the year was $342 million, up 27% over last year.  The increase primarily reflects the incremental interest from funding acquisitions and $500 million of share repurchases, net of the proceeds received from the Matthew Clark transaction.  ", "Now let\u2019s take a look at our debt.  At the end of February, our total debt totaled $5.3 billion which compares to $4.2 billion of debt at the end of fiscal 2007.  The increase reflects $386 million Svedka acquisition, $885 million for the Fortune Wine business acquisition, $500 million in share repurchases, partially offset by $186 million in proceeds from the Matthew Clark JV transaction, $134 million received from the sale of Almaden and Inglenook and our strong free cash flow generation during the year.", "At the end of the year we had approximately $2.7 billion of bank debt under our senior credit facility.  Our interest rates are generally tied to LIBOR plus a margin of about 1.25-1.5%.  Approximately $1.2 billion of this debt is effectively fixed with interest rate SWAPs through 2010.  The remainder of our borrowings is comprised of $2.6 billion of fixed term and other debt.  Our average interest rate for 08 was just under 7%.  We have received a lot of questions related to the challenging debt market and whether this will have any impact on our company.  ", "We have $556 million of revolving credit available under our senior facility at the end of February.  This provides ample liquidity and flexibility and is in place through June 2011.  There is no issue with accessing this facility.  Our debt to comparable basis EBIDTA ratio at the end of February was 5.3 times.  Although on the high side of our historical range, we\u2019re comfortable with this level.  With the strong free cash flow planned for fiscal 2009, we believe we can reduce this ratio to the low to mid 4 times range over the next 12 months.  ", "Our comparable basis tax rate came at 32.6% versus 35.6% last year.  The rate decrease was driven by favorable foreign tax rate changes recognized in the fourth quarter.  Our comparable weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year totaled $223 million compared to $240 million last year, reflecting the benefit from a share repurchase.  The wine brands acquired from Fortune produce $14 million of net sales for the two and a half months we owned them in the fourth quarter.  ", "We estimate the results of the acquired business produced approximately $0.03 to $0.04 of dilution.  As previously discussed, this was anticipated and primarily driven by high levels of product inventory in the distributor channel in the fourth quarter which resulted in net sales for the acquired business that were well below normal levels.  Distributor inventories for these brands were at Constellation\u2019s target levels at the end of February.  Due to the many factors just mentioned, diluted EPS was $1.44 versus $1.68 last year.", "Now let\u2019s turn to cash flow on page 12.  For purposes of this discussion, free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending.  For fiscal 2008, we generated record free cash flow of $376 million versus $121 million in the prior year.  The year over year increase reflects lower taxes paid, improvements in working capital and reduced capital spending.  We anticipate following this performance with another strong cash flow year in fiscal 2009.  ", "For fiscal 2009, we are targeting free cash flow to be in the range of $310-$340 million.  This includes cap ex in the range of $150-$170 million.  We expect free cash flow to be down slightly from fiscal 2008 as the benefits of higher earnings will be offset by higher cash taxes paid as some of the timing benefits from 08 reverse and higher working capital investment, primarily related to increased harvest requirements anticipated in 09.", "Summarizing fiscal 2008, we made a lot of strategic progress.  We are pleased with our results.  We made progress with our initiatives to drive performance improvement in the UK and Australia.  The acquisitions of Svedka and Fortunes Wine business combined with the Almaden and Inglenook divestiture have strengthened the company\u2019s premium position.  We also completed the Crown and Matthew Clark joint venture transitions and increased our focus on improving free cash flow.  As a result of these efforts, we are enthusiastic about our prospects as we head into fiscal 2009.", "Moving to our P&L outlook for the full year 09, we\u2019re forecasting on a comparable basis diluted EPS in the range of $1.68 to $1.76.  The significant improvement in projected results reflects solid underlying growth for our North American wine business and the Crown imports joint venture.  In addition to anticipated performance improvement in our UK and Australian wine business.  Earnings will also benefit from the completion of our initiative to reduce US distributor wine inventories.  ", "We effectively completed this by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2008 with an estimated one time impact of $110 million to net sales and comparable EPS impact of about $0.15, with approximately 75% of that impact coming in the first quarter and the remainder hitting in the second quarter.  We expect reported net sales to increase mid single digits.  Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, organic net sales are expected to result in an increase of high single digits.  Organic net sales growth excluding the onetime benefit of completing the distributor inventory reduction is expect to be mid single digits.  ", "We expect operating margin expansion for the wine segment in excess of 200 basis points for fiscal 2009, reflecting the impact of the various items we discussed earlier.  Interest expense is expected to be in the range of $340 to $350 million.  This is fairly level with fiscal 2008 as the full year impact of funding the share repurchase and the Fortune Wine business acquisition is offset by the $134 million received for the sale of Almaden and Inglenook at the end of fiscal 2008 and the free cash flow generation we are targeting for 09.  We anticipate the tax rate to approximate 37%.  ", "As a reminder, a very high percentage of our profits are being generated in the higher tax jurisdictions in North America.  We\u2019re seeing a weighted average diluted shares of approximately $222 million.  We also expect stock based compensation expense to approximate 46 million versus 32 million in fiscal 2008, as we continue to recognize higher stock compensation expense for the transition effects of SFAS 123R.  ", "Corporate expenses are expected to be in the range of $95-$100 million.  The increase versus fiscal 2008 includes the impact of additional stock compensation expense and costs to support the growth of the company.  In addition, we are still targeting a penny to two penny accretion in fiscal 09 for the Fortune Wine business acquisition offset by a penny to two penny dilution from the Almaden and Inglenook divestiture.  Our comparable basis guidance excludes acquisition related integration costs, restructuring and related charges and unusual items which are detailed on page 19 of the news release.  With that, we\u2019re happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "Thank you.  (Operator instructions).  Thank you, our first question is coming from Tim Ramey of D. A. Davidson.", "Tim Ramey \u2013 D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Good morning.  You mentioned the IRI numbers on line growth which are encouraging but can you give us any further detail about what order patterns look like, the economic news is evolving quickly and is that seeming to have any impact on the line business or is it sort of business as usual?", "Rob Sands", "You know first I would say that I think that in general its business as usual.  As I talked about, you know we do tend to see some venue shift and economic downturns.  We\u2019ve seen some shift from on premise to off premise.  We\u2019ve seen some shift within the off premise to the mass merchandisers away from some of the chain retailers and specialty retail accounts.  ", "But in general I think that the wine business has been pretty strong and I do think that the IRI data for the last 12 weeks shows that, although I will say that that data, you should take into account the fact that Easter was early this year and within this 12 week period but wasn\u2019t in the same 12 week period a year ago, so that did drive some of the positive results.  Although I don\u2019t think that that was indicative of anything, I think that the underlying sales trends at retail look to be pretty strong for wine.", "Tim Ramey \u2013 D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Terrific, thanks.  ", "Operator", "", "Thank you.  Our next question is coming from Kaumil Gajrawala from UBS.", "Kaumil Gajrawala \u2013 UBS", "Thank you, hello everybody.  Rob thanks for the update on the Crown but I have a couple follow up questions.  First, in addition to the price increase from last year there was also some transition and some sales execution issues.  Can you maybe talk about what you\u2019ve done internally over the last 12 months and why fiscal 2009 will be different?", "Rob Sands", "", "Sure Kaumil, obviously when we put the Crown joint venture together we were in the process of filling in the organization primarily in the East.  We had to hire over 150 people to fill out that organization.  And you know although I think that the Crown team did a great job in making sure that we were covered, when you\u2019re involved in transitional activities that big, you know there\u2019s clearly going to be some transition issues.  ", "Now as we move into this year, you know the organization is all up and running, we\u2019ve got all teams and positions filled with people have gotten sufficient experience in their new positions and we think we\u2019ve got great people by the way.  So you know we\u2019re pretty confident that any transitional issues that we have had are behind us and that Crown is up and running and should be 100% in terms of execution capabilities.", "Kaumil Gajrawala \u2013 UBS", "Okay great and then if I could ask an economic question, it seems like we\u2019re seeing some of the sub-premiums in the beer categories start to do a little bit better.  I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s related from the channel shift or if you\u2019re seeing kind of fundamental trading down across beer?  And then maybe if you could touch on what\u2019s happening in wine as well.", "Rob Sands", "", "Well you know I think that as it relates to, did you say sub-premiums or premiums?", "Kaumil Gajrawala \u2013 UBS", "I said sub-premiums.", "Rob Sands", "", "Yeah I think that we have seen an increased performance in the sub-premium category.  There\u2019s no doubt about it.  At the same time, you know crafts continue to do well and I think that as Corona and the Modello portfolio laps the price increase, we\u2019re beginning to see some strong growth in some of our key markets as well and being such a large percentage of the import and therefore the import category, we should see improved trends there as well.  But definitely sub-premiums in the most recent data have also turned up versus their historical performance.  ", "There\u2019s no doubt about that.  In wine we continued to see much of the same as what we\u2019ve seen in the past, we see extremely strong growth in the premium plus categories and especially in the super premium plus which is $8.00 and above where we have leading positions.  We continue to see very, very strong double digit growth in those categories and we continue to see strong trading up trends in the wine business.  You know some of the very highest priced tiers in the wine business may see some slight softness as a result of the economy but basically that\u2019s immaterial to the wine business as a whole.  So you know it\u2019s super premium plus, $8.00 and above, $20 and below you know where we have the leading position, as I said, strong double digit growth.", "Kaumil Gajrawala \u2013 UBS", "Okay, perfect, thank you.", "Operator", "", "Thank you, our next question is coming from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.", "Judy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Good morning.  I wanted to ask a couple of questions on wine and beer.  First on the wine side, I guess I\u2019m still trying to reconcile the 5% decline in the sales number, organic sales number in the fourth quarter with seemingly solid underlying depletion numbers.  So first question is what was the depletion number in the fourth quarter in North America wine?", "Rob Sands", "", "Right, we don\u2019t give depletion numbers but we had positive depletion growth in the fourth quarter for North American wine and yes there was a 5% decline in sales but as we\u2019ve told you in the past, that was primarily related to the change in shipment patterns as a result of the distributor inventory reduction.  Historically we shipped much more product in the fourth quarter than our new shipment patterns than will be our new shipment patterns and consequently, the sales downturn was fully expected and is not in any way reflective of the underlying sales trends which as we said, depletion trends were positive.", "Judy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Was there any change in the depletion trends from third quarter to the fourth quarter at all?", "Rob Sands", "", "Depletion trends from third quarter to fourth quarter improved.", "Judy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay because, okay.  And then on the beer side, you know I think obviously you know you\u2019ve talked about the price increases and you\u2019ve talked about the transition issues hurting the 08 performance, I\u2019m just wondering I mean obviously there was a lot of competition as well from some of the new product and [takatis] performance was also stronger when you kind of look back in the past 12 months or so.  ", "I\u2019m just wondering if you think that there\u2019s been any impact on the competitive front and then you alluded to the comment about California being pretty weak and that you\u2019ve got some initiatives in place to restore growth in that market, so if you could just talk about what you\u2019re trying to do in California and then whether you expect to see even more impact from competition as Bud rolls out their Bud Light with lime.", "Rob Sands", "", "Right, yeah we specifically said just to be clear that we expect mid single digit growth in our imported beer business this year.  And that\u2019s going to be accomplished in a number of ways but I guess specifically to some of your questions, first of all competition from new products, the Modello portfolio and Corona has always had competition from new products every year or two, there\u2019s always products that are introduced that are geared or aimed to compete with Corona.  And I think that we\u2019ve been very successful in competing against those products.  ", "You know we have very strong marketing programs, very strong sales and promotional programs with both retail and with our distributors and you know although we take competition seriously, it\u2019s really been a fact of life almost forever.  Now a lot of the competition that you see is in the area of flavored malt beverages, thinks like Bud with lime and Miller Chill and things to this effect.  And generally our experience has been that customized products generally haven\u2019t been highly serious competition for Corona because the consumer generally as it relates to lime and lemon like to customize the product themselves.  ", "That\u2019s also been some of the experience in the soft drinks industry as well.  But you know that said, you know as I said we always take competition seriously.  Southern California is a tough market.  It has been particularly hard hit by the economic downturn.  And all I can say relative to that is that it\u2019s a market we\u2019re going to be working extra hard in and looking at very closely to make sure that we optimize our performance in that market.  In general and in a lot of our markets where we\u2019ve lapped the price increase, we\u2019re seeing good positive growth return to the brand and that\u2019s why we\u2019re pretty confident that we can accomplish mid single digit growth rates this year.", "Judy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay and then just a follow up on beer, if you pro forma last year\u2019s number to include the full three months of Crown, could you tell us what the sales line would have been in the fourth quarter?", "Bob Ryder", "Judy this is Bob, as you know they\u2019re not comparable because of the weakness in the back half for Crown which was attributable to frankly last year\u2019s high.  The sales for the full year will be slightly negative.  But it\u2019s all driven by the previous year\u2019s activity because of the formation of the Crown JV.  And that\u2019s not a depletion number, that\u2019s a sale number.", "Judy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Right and can you tell us what the depletion would have been?", "Bob Ryder", "Depletions would have been positive in the low single digits.", "Judy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you.  Our next question is coming from [Riza Zabazita] from Lehman Brothers.", "[Riza Zabazita] \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Good morning.  Just I\u2019m wondering if share repurchases of any size is something that you would consider, obviously your stock is where it is and this time last year you had some share repurchases conducted when the stock was I guess in this range, how do you think about share repurchases?", "Bob Ryder", "In general we\u2019re right now we\u2019re focused on debt repayment, we\u2019re not going to rule anything out.  But debt repayment is probably where we\u2019re focused right now.", "[Riza Zabazita] \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Okay so you don\u2019t have an appetite for it and is there any restrictions on that as well?", "Bob Ryder", "Not really.  It would be an internal decision.", "[Riza Zabazita] \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Okay and then how do you think about acquisitions?  Obviously you\u2019ve been opportunistic in the past including the Fortune Wine.  Is there a thing that could come out of the recent consolidation activity in the industry or are you still focused on the base business?", "Rob Sands", "", "Yeah I mean I think as Bob pointed out that we\u2019re pretty focused on optimizing our existing business and generating efficiencies within our business, cash flow generation, debt pay down, but you know acquisitions remain a part of our strategy so we wouldn\u2019t categorically rule out acquisitions at this point.  But you know we\u2019ve made a lot of acquisitions and we\u2019re very well positioned for the future so you know it remains to be seen if we have any specifics we\u2019ll certainly let you know at the time.  But in the meantime the focus is on the organic business and again as Bob said debt reduction and cash flow generation.", "[Riza Zabazita] \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "And then lastly will cash flow from Crown imports roughly approximate the earnings from that business that\u2019s running through your P&L?", "Bob Ryder", "", "Yeah, it will roughly equate to it.  There\u2019s a separate line item on the cash flow statement where you can see the difference between the two.  I think this year was about $20-$30 million difference and that had actually something to do with just the startup of the JV.  But generally we both partners sweep the cash from Modello pretty regularly.", "[Riza Zabazita] \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Thank you.  Our next question is coming from Lauren Torres from HSBC.", "Lauren Torres \u2013 HSBC", "Good morning.  Just a clarification Bob, you talked about good earnings growth but a decline, year over year decline in free cash flow.  Is that all due to just taxes you\u2019re getting hit with or that the change in taxes year over year?", "Bob Ryder", "", "Yeah it\u2019s pretty much attributable to taxes Lauren.  And a lot of its timing.  We paid again because of timing extremely low cash taxes this year.  That cannot be replicated in future years.  So we\u2019ll be paying a lot more cash taxes next year than this year.  And that\u2019s sort of driving the year over year reduction in cash flow, although the number I still think I\u2019m very happy with, it\u2019s still a very strong number even with those cash tax payments in 09.", "Lauren Torres \u2013 HSBC", "Okay and also if I could just ask a question or two on your wine business?  Obviously we saw a number of these wine inventory reductions last fiscal year, if you could just talk about Rob maybe where you are now, are you comfortable at these levels even with the Fortune Brands coming in.  Is everything complete, what you expected to have done in the fourth quarter as we look into this year?", "Rob Sands", "", "Yeah, we completed the inventory reduction pretty much in the second half of last year and we\u2019re very comfortable with distributor inventory levels and have no intention at this stage to reduce distributed inventory levels further or to operating on any different basis, so that\u2019s pretty much history.", "Bob Ryder", "", "And Lauren the other one that you referred to is the reduction in the Fortune Brand inventories and that was also completed by the end of our year.", "Lauren Torres \u2013 HSBC", "Okay and just quickly, lastly also on wines, we\u2019ve seen the sale of value brands.  Are there more types of sales like that to come and how should we think about that in our numbers for this year?", "Rob Sands", "", "You know we\u2019re always looking at our portfolio.  You know obviously we can\u2019t talk about specifics when it comes to dispositions until such time that we have something to announce.  But you know I would say that if as we continue to examine our portfolio if it makes sense to dispose of anything and there\u2019s a buyer and the right purchase price can be obtained, that\u2019s always a possibility in the future.", "Lauren Torres \u2013 HSBC", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "", "Thank you, our next question is coming from Marc Greenberg from Deutsche Bank.", "Marc Greenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Good morning.  My question relates to the $822 million write down in overseas assets.  You noted that that was primarily Hardy\u2019s.  That\u2019s a significant portion of the $1.4 odd billion that you paid for the asset in 2003.  I know these are non cash in nature, but I really wanted to have a return discussion with you, that was about 14 times LTM EBIDTA in 03, in my mind a write down of this size highlights deal risk.  ", "I was hoping you could talk about how we should think about return that you\u2019re getting on your acquisitions in light of this kind of a write down and should we be concerned about other non cash charges and maybe as an example, since then you\u2019ve both Mondavi, Vincor and Fortune in the US and how should we think about, I know we\u2019re not seeing it, the risk to further write downs were we to see significant weakness in the US wine market and what that might say about returns on acquisitions, thanks.", "Bob Ryder", "", "Sure, logical question Marc.  You know as we\u2019ve been talking over the last two years, you know we\u2019ve been subject to some unique things happening between the UK and the Australian market with the excess Australian wine, the retailer pressure, the duties in the UK and frankly what\u2019s happened to foreign exchange rates.  So we think that the Hardy acquisition itself, it\u2019s a unique circumstance that we have to take this reduction.  The US wine acquisitions we\u2019re very happy with.  We\u2019re nowhere near any kind of impairment charge and as you guys know, the calculation for SFAS 142 is different than a calculation you would do like if you were deciding to buy a business or not.  ", "It\u2019s different in a lot of ways but one of the big ways is the discount rates assumed.  So you know the SFAS 142 impairment charge had a much higher discount rate than we would assume if we were looking to buy something.  That all being said, look the profits that we\u2019re generating from Australia and the UK are a lot less than we assumed when we bought the Hardy business, that\u2019s just a fact and as the SFAS 142 calculation looked at it, the future cash flows, although we expect them to grow, they would not grow enough to support that large of an asset base, which is what drove the SFAS 142.  But I would also say that this impairment hit really would have no reflection on the other acquisitions that we have done.  This one is unique.", "Marc Greenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay and so you know Rob you talked about the $8.00-$20.00 wine segment continuing to perform well and that really is a sweet spot for you guys.  If we began to see market deterioration within those price points and prior wine cycles certainly there\u2019s been some volatility there.  And it had a negative impact on profitability, would you then based on this impairment stuff be forced to go back and look at your asset value in that kind of a scenario?", "Rob Sands", "", "Yeah we don\u2019t anticipate having any impairment issue with any other acquisitions period.  I don\u2019t agree that that segment is as negatively affected in economic downturns, I actually don\u2019t know what history you\u2019re referring to there.  But I can tell you that for instance the luxury segment is growing at over 20% at the current time.  And as I said, the other super premium category and super premium plus in general is high single digits.  You know this is not, these are not categories that are beyond what I would refer to as affordable luxuries.  ", "You\u2019re not talking about $50.00 bottles of wine.  So we don\u2019t anticipate that these categories should show any different momentum than they\u2019ve shown in the past.  And you know we\u2019re, our acquisitions in general are performing extremely well, they\u2019ve added a lot of value to the company.  And you know I don\u2019t anticipate any issues whatsoever outside of, as Bob pointed out, the pretty unique circumstances that we\u2019ve talked about in great detail as it relates to Australia and the Australian business in the UK.  That\u2019s a very specific set of circumstances and I think that the good news there is you now really twofold.  ", "Number one, I think that that\u2019s bottomed out, I think that we\u2019re pretty optimistic that at this stage you know it\u2019s only, there\u2019s only upside as opposed to downside and at this stage we\u2019re talking about 10% of our EBIT.  So its importance has greatly diminished.  So when you combine those two factors that it looks like its bottomed out, there\u2019s only upside, it\u2019s only 10% or so of our EBIT, I think that you know we\u2019re pretty optimistic as we move forward here.", "Marc Greenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Thank you our next question is coming from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel Nicolaus.", "Mark Swartzberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Thanks.  Good morning everyone.  A couple questions, cash flow balance sheet and then a beer question.  But on the cash flow side of things, when you talk about your interest expense assumptions for fiscal 09 Bob, what assumption are you making regarding sale of non-core assets, is that number zero, $200 million, $300 million, I mean just I appreciate what you said earlier Rob but could you just give us an idea of what your assumption there is?", "Bob Ryder", "", "Yeah we\u2019re not assuming any sale of core assets in our guidance.", "Mark Swartzberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, great.  And then if we shift over to free cash flow and look at how its unfolded in the year that just wrapped, obviously very nice and very healthy number, that $376 number, it was quite a bit higher than what you had guided to when you came out of the third quarter.  And a little bit of that\u2019s earnings related but it seems like most of that is more working capital related.  Can you talk a little bit more about what is going on, I think receivables is a big variable there.  ", "What\u2019s going on there, was it a big customer, what\u2019s going on there?  And then if we think about working capital just as a larger area of opportunity, we\u2019ve heard from you Rob about comping folks more on the basis of really delivering the free cash flow, what\u2019s changed in terms of how persons running his or her respective business to make them really just consistently generate cash flow off a given level of sales?", "Bob Ryder", "", "Yeah, I\u2019ll handle the first half of that.  But you know cash flow did come in higher than we had guided on the third quarter call, I think we said it would be $280-$300.  And you know Mark as you know, cash flow because it\u2019s just a snapshot at the last minute of the year tends to be a little bit more volatile than earnings and I\u2019d say that we had some positive timing.  Some of it around working capital in 08 but also a lot of it around tax cash flows, I think that\u2019s probably the big driver here and you know in our K we actually give cash taxes paid and you\u2019ll see it\u2019s a very low number.  So that was probably the biggest positive surprise to us versus the guidance that we gave in the third quarter.", "Mark Swartzberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay and practice wise can you just comment on you know all of us are trying to figure out how much of this is kind of one-off in nature and how much of it is just you know a higher level of core free cash flows than most of us thought about before?", "Bob Ryder", "", "So I guess some general things and then some specific things.  And general things is we are making cash flow, we have made cash flow a component of management incentive which does in my experience does tend to change focus and mentality of the business.  So I do think we will see improvements there, we are talking about I call it manageable cash flow which I\u2019ll sort of separate into a couple buckets.  And working capital is a big buckets, capital spending is a big bucket and taxes are a big bucket.  They\u2019re sort of manageable.  So we are focusing a lot more on that.  ", "I would also say that this year mother nature probably helped us a little bit because of the low harvests, primarily in New Zealand and Australia and somewhat in the US.  So and that\u2019s a big driver, you know we have an agro piece of our business that we\u2019re exposed to.  But even there we\u2019re trying to get more of that within our control and as we speak we\u2019re launching a project to try to see how much we can reduce our investment in inventories.  So we\u2019re focusing on our reducing our net investments in working capital.  So that\u2019s about it.", "Mark Swartzberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "That\u2019s very helpful.  Thanks for that.  And then Rob on the beer business the scanner data for March is showing a nice pickup in depletions for Corona, do you think that\u2019s representative of depletion rate that we can all see is more broadly occurring across all channels including those that are not captured by the scanner data in March?  And then obviously Easter helped but in your experience is Easter a big mover of a given month\u2019s depletions versus a prior period or latter period depletions?", "Rob Sands", "", "Yeah I think that Easter being early definitely had some impact on that but it is only one month, so we\u2019re talking about 12 week period which is, so that kind of balances it out a bit.  And then you know we\u2019re expecting mid single digit growth so I think that the trends that you site are demonstrative that we should be able to achieve our targets.  So you know we take also as a positive sign and the brand is continuing to exhibit much of the same patterns as its exhibited in the past which is flattened out sales growth in the 12-15 month period following a price increase with growth returning to the brand thereafter but perhaps at a slightly lower rate or a bit lower rate than the growth where it was before the price increase.  ", "So you know all indications are that brand strength is still strong.  You know you\u2019re probably read in the paper today that you know Nielsen was quoted as saying that in the 21 year to 35 year old group that Corona is still sighted as the strongest brand and you know that\u2019s pretty indicative of the strength of the brand for the future.  So you know we feel pretty good about where we are right now with Crown and the beer business.", "Mark Swartzberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "That\u2019s great and real quick, on California you\u2019re kind of highlighting that as an area that\u2019s kind of more challenging than some other markets but sequentially if you look at March for California how is that doing for you again at depletion level versus what you\u2019ve been seeing prior to that?", "Rob Sands", "", "Yeah, California has not bounced back at this stage.  You know we don\u2019t want to look like we\u2019ve got our head buried in the sand but not take into account the fact that California has been particularly hard hit by the economy and that could have some effect on the brand in California.  On the other hand, you know balancing that with other parts of the country that are not as hard hit and the cycling through of the price increase we think it\u2019s going to get us to the growth that we\u2019ve indicated in our guidance of mid single digit.  If California wasn\u2019t as hard hit as it was we\u2019d probably be talking about higher growth rates than that for 09.  So our guidance in that regard or the growth rates that we\u2019re indicating that we expect take into account potential softness in that particular market.", "Mark Swartzberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Great, thanks Bob, thanks Rob.", "Operator", "", "Thank you, our next call is coming from Jonathan Feeney from Wachovia.", "Jonathan Feeney \u2013 Wachovia Securities", "Thank you very much.  Rob I wanted to, as far as the economic sensitivity of branded wines I wanted to clarify you know the performance of the Mondavi brands, because I remember back in 01, 02 recession, looking at my old model here, it looks like revenues were down 8, cases were down 6 and operating profit was down 16 in fiscal 02.  And I guess I know that\u2019s probably at most one-quarter of your business right now but it seemed like that was pretty sensitive.  I know you have broader distribution and some probably better marketing but I mean that was a pretty big impact.  I mean what do you think has changed about that portfolio in the past five or six years that it\u2019s going to allow it to hold up in a tough macro environment much better?", "Rob Sands", "", "You know I think that the Mondavi brands are really strong brands and have even gotten stronger since that time.  I think that you know our having acquired them and our execution against those brands has really been superlative and strengthened the position of those brands.  In fact we\u2019ve seen performance in just about any period that you\u2019re talking about that even exceeds our expectations you know, brands like Woodbridge grew 6% last year.  I can tell you right now that you know that, we would not have conservatively estimated that the brand would have grown at that rate.  But we\u2019re very pleased with the way that it\u2019s been performing.  ", "In the time period that you\u2019re citing, there\u2019s really a big factor that\u2019s a big difference between now and then, in 2001 and that timeframe, there was a big oversupply of grapes at that particular time you know which created some of the phenomena in the marketplace like Two Buck Chuck and that kind of thing.  The world is a lot different today, we\u2019ve moved from an oversupply cycle into a cycle where we\u2019re probably moving into undersupply, so you don\u2019t have the same kind of pressures of marginal players that you had during that particular timeframe.  So you know that\u2019s one of the big differences and the other big difference is that you know we\u2019ve got the, I believe the strongest organization in the industry selling marketing the Mondavi brands today and I think that\u2019s also a major difference and we\u2019re seeing the results of it.", "Jonathan Feeney \u2013 Wachovia Securities", "Thanks and just if you wouldn\u2019t mind for Bob just one follow up question on the $310 to $340 09 free cash flow guidance, can you give us a ballpark figure how much cash taxes you plan to pay within the context of that guidance?", "Bob Ryder", "", "No, not really because again there\u2019s a lot of timing year over year.  We are going to update at our May meeting, we\u2019re going to spend a little bit more time on taxes because I think if you look historically our cash tax rate is well below our effective tax rate.  So I would say that next year our cash take tax rate again will be below our effective tax rate.  But I\u2019m not ready to give a number right now.", "Jonathan Feeney \u2013 Wachovia Securities", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "", "Thank you our final question is coming from Bryan Spillane from Banc of America.", "Bryan Spillane \u2013 Banc of America", "Hey, good morning guys.  A couple of things, first a clarification.  You said low single, fourth quarter low single digit depletion growth for beer, low to mid single digit for wine, did you give a number for spirits as well?", "Rob Sands", "", "We said positive for wine or low single digits.", "Bryan Spillane \u2013 Banc of America", "Okay and then spirits, did you give a depletion number for spirits as well?", "Rob Sands", "", "No but spirit depletions would be very high.  Our spirits growth is both with Svedka and without Svedka is pretty strong Bryan.", "Bryan Spillane \u2013 Banc of America", "Okay and then Bob were there any, was there any influence of hedges in your P&L in the fourth quarter?  So any mark to market gains or losses?", "Bob Ryder", "", "Nothing material.", "Bryan Spillane \u2013 Banc of America", "Okay and then as we look into next year could you just talk a little bit about where you stand now in terms of hedges, is there anything that we should be thinking about that might influence results next year in terms of hedges?", "Bob Ryder", "", "No I mean we\u2019re keeping our normal hedging policy and I think you know actually year over year, we\u2019re sort of overlapping when dollar sort of reduction in 08, so 09 over 08 there shouldn\u2019t be as much Forex volatility, if we stay where we are now versus what we saw 08 over 07.", "Bryan Spillane \u2013 Banc of America", "Okay and then finally you know as you, Rob as you look out over you know over 09 and in 2010, how would you weight how you\u2019re incenting your managers, meaning what\u2019s the weighting between how much you want to see volume growth, revenue growth, free cash flow improvement and you know improvement in margins and efficiencies, if you could just kind of talk to what the weightings are for your managers now and maybe what that was like, what that is now relative  to what it was a year ago or two years ago.", "Rob Sands", "", "Well as I\u2019ve talked about quite a bit, we\u2019ve added a significant free cash flow component to the weighting of our incentives for our managers.  Now they also have a significant weighting in EBIT and so that\u2019s a little bit of a double up you could say alright because EBIT is a large portion or a significant component of free cash flow in addition to the balance sheet elements.  And then we also have a good weighting or a significant weighting in depletions and depletion growth for our managers.  ", "Because you know obviously we really want them focused on driving that.  So the exact weighting it really differs depending on what level you\u2019re talking about in the company and it\u2019s not the same for everybody because you know we tailor it somewhat to what we\u2019re trying to accomplish in various division and segments and this and that.  But those are the three things that in general would be the areas that we focus on for our people when it comes to their incentive plans.", "Bryan Spillane \u2013 Banc of America", "And just relative to what incentives look like previous, it\u2019s you know less volume oriented and more profit and cash flow oriented, is it fair to say that?", "Rob Sands", "", "More cash flow oriented and therefore less of the other two because to include cash flow obviously, something had to be reduced.  But in general and historically, our incentive comp has been pretty much focused on EBIT and depletion growth and we added the cash flow component to get more focus in particular on the balance sheet, you know people were focused on EBIT generally in any event and as Bob pointed out they\u2019ve become you know the cash flow component has people more focused on what we call controllable cash flow which in addition to the P&L would basically be the areas of working capital and cap ex and you know it really gets people focused on the nuts and bolts of working capital.  ", "I mean you know there\u2019s no silver bullet to any of it but when people start looking at all of the elements of cash flow and thinking about how they can impact each one of those elements, you know it\u2019s a little bit here and a little bit there and you know before you know it you\u2019re talking about real money and I think that that\u2019s one of the reasons why we feel pretty good about the fact that you know the kind of cash flow we generated last year is going to be sustainable as we move into this year, albeit a little bit less, our guidance was a bit less but still in the $300 plus range, $310-$340 million which you know I think is pretty indicative that you guys can expect more conversion of EBIT to cash flow and is consistent with our focus on generating cash flow and debt pay downs.  So that\u2019s where we\u2019re at.", "Bryan Spillane \u2013 Banc of America", "Okay, great, thanks guys.", "Rob Sands", "", "Okay well thank you all for joining our call today.  As I indicated I\u2019m really very pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made during the year on all fronts.  Our accomplishments in fiscal 2008 position us well for success in the future and I\u2019m very optimistic about where we\u2019re headed in 2009.  We feel that we\u2019re well on the way to meeting our mid to long term goals that I\u2019ve talked about which we\u2019re certainly going to discuss more in detail when we get together at our upcoming investor meeting in New York, scheduled for late May.  So we\u2019re looking forward to seeing you all then and thanks again for your participation today.", "Operator", "", "Thank you, that does conclude today\u2019s Constellation Brand\u2019s fiscal 2008 earnings conference call, you may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

My name is Ray and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Constellation Brands first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Madam, you may begin your conference. ", "Patty Yahn-Urlaub", "Thank you, Ray. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Constellation\u2019s first quarter fiscal year 2009 conference call. I am here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer. ", "By now, you should have had an opportunity to read our news release, which has also been furnished to the SEC. This conference call is intended to complement the release. ", "During the call, we will discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable organic and constant currency basis. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company\u2019s website at www.cbrands.com, under the investor section. These reconciliations include explanations as to why management uses the non-GAAP financial measures and why management believes they are useful to investors. ", "Discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results, excluding acquisition-related costs, restructuring and related charges, and unusual items. We will also discuss organic net sales information, which is defined in the news release, and constant currency net sales information, which excludes the impact of year-over-year currency exchange rate fluctuations. ", "Please be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company\u2019s estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation\u2019s SEC filings. ", "Thank you, and now I would like to turn the call over to Rob. ", "Robert S. Sands", "Thanks, Patty and good morning, everyone. First I would like to thank all of you who attended our recent New York City investors meeting. I hope that one of your takeaways from that meeting is that Constellation management team is intensely focused on executing a strategy that delivers value by enhancing operating margins and profitability, improving ROIC, and generating free cash flow, which enables debt reduction. I believe our first quarter results and fiscal 2009 financial goals demonstrate that commitment. ", "Another example of this strategic execution is the recently announced divestiture of certain U.S. wine brands and assets that were acquired with the Clos du Bois and Wild Horse transaction, as well as some of our northwest brands from Washington State and Idaho. ", "Collectively, these brands represented approximately 1 million cases of wine sold in calendar 2007. Despite the fact that these were premium brands, the rationale for divesting was straightforward. We simplified our portfolio, eliminated product redundancies, and better aligned the cost to produce our products with their corresponding price points at retail. We received $209 million in cash for these brands, which we utilized to reduce debt, and we have an opportunity to receive up to $25 million in an earn-out if certain business objectives are met by the buyer within the next five years. ", "So now I\u2019d like to discuss our business and financial performance for our first quarter. We\u2019re off to a great start in fiscal 2009. Our results for the first quarter were solid and in line with our expectations. We increased sales and enhanced profitability in our North American and international operations above and beyond the benefit we received from the cycling of our U.S. distributor wine inventory reduction initiative. ", "From an international perspective, we\u2019ve been taking actions to improve profitability, operating efficiencies, and our competitive position in both the U.K. and Australian markets. These actions have started bearing fruit and we\u2019ve improved our operating margins and profitability during the quarter. ", "We implemented planned price increases to retailers in the U.K., which has enabled us to realize an increase in our net sales prices. As a result, volumes have suffered somewhat but not as much as expected. Having said that, the wine market in the U.K. remains healthy, growing at a rate of mid-single-digits on a value basis in the multiple grocer channel per recent Nielsen data. ", "In Australia, the wine market is also healthy, growing mid-single-digits on a value basis. Similar to the U.K., we have recently increased prices in Australia to cover rising input costs and have seen a bit of volume reduction as we strive to improve profitability. ", "The 2008 Australian grape harvest is now essentially complete. Although final data is not yet available, it appears that the current harvest estimate is approximately 1.7 million tons versus a harvest of about 1.5 million tons last year. This outcome is a bit higher than anticipated due to the late season rainfall but it still appears that supply is in line with demand. Nevertheless, the cost of Australian grapes has increased significantly due to the fact that many growers paid for water supply during the growing season due to the drought conditions in this region. This has created the unusual situation of higher harvest volume in the face of higher prices, which indicates that it is unlikely that we will see an abundance of lower price bulk wine availability. ", "I would also like to once again remind everyone that the U.K. and Australian markets combined currently represent less than 10% of our total company EBIT. However, it is important to emphasize that despite the volume impact from price increases in our international business, we have increased profitability during the first quarter. ", "And moving to the U.S. wine business, as you know we completed our U.S. wine distributor inventory reduction initiative during the first two quarters of our fiscal year 2008. We have regained operating leverage as we\u2019ve cycled this initiative, which negatively impacted last year\u2019s first quarter results. ", "In addition, we also improved the margins of our branded wine business as a result of the favorable product mix generated by the addition of the Clos du Bois and Wild Horse brands and a divestiture of lower margin value brands, including Almaden and Inglenook. Plus the rationalization of more than 60 brands within our value portfolio, representing about 1,600 SKUs. ", "As a result of these portfolio changes, our value premium mix has changed dramatically in IRI channels. Our U.S. portfolio is now comprised of approximately 30% value wine and 70% premium wine on a volume basis and about 15% value versus 85% premium on a dollar basis. ", "From a marketplace perspective, growth in the U.S. premium wine market remains very healthy at about 7% on a dollar basis, according to recent 12-week IRI data through mid-May, and in particular the super premium plus segment where wine sells for $8 and above at retail continues to grow in the double-digit range. This segment includes brands in our portfolio such as Estancia and Kim Crawford and Robert Mondavi, all of which posted double-digit market growth during the 12-week IRI period ending May 18th. ", "Our Canadian wine business posted strong results for the first quarter, primarily reflecting sales growth from premium brands, including Jackson Triggs and Sawmill Creek and Naked Grape. ", "In the spirits segment, SVEDKA Vodka posted strong double-digit sales and market growth for the first quarter, driven by new distribution points and increased promotional activity. During the past year alone, SVEDKA has gained new distributions in more than 4,500 national on and off premise accounts. We are continuing to aggressively expand SVEDKA\u2019s export sales to countries outside the U.S. SVEDKA is currently sold in over 25 export markets, including Germany, China, Australia, France, Brazil and Canada, for example. ", "Our spirits business also reflects strong sales growth in the quarter from key brands, including Black Velvet and Ridgemont Reserve Bourbon, Effen Vodka, Meukow Cognac, and the Caravella of liqueurs. ", "In an effort to streamline operations and improve efficiencies, we recently announced our intent to sell our Valley Field, Quebec facility, which was primarily a contract production facility for third parties. This will allow us to eliminate excess capacity, reduce costs, and enhance ROIC. This transaction is now expected to close during the second quarter as we work through the final details to ensure a smooth transition. ", "Moving to Crown imports joint venture, Crown generated low-single-digit net sales growth against a tough comparison last year. We saw strong performance in April offset by weaker performance in May due to challenging comparisons to prior year promotional period for Cinco de Mayo and Memorial Day, coupled with some impact from new competitive product introductions. ", "In addition, large markets like California and Florida continue to be challenged due to adverse economic factors in these areas. However, the joint venture continues to target mid-single-digit growth for the business as they head into the key summer selling season. We believe Crown is well-positioned for execution at retail accounts with solid promotional activity and market programs in place. They are maintaining appropriate price spreads versus competitors and have a strong, fully staffed organization. ", "As a reminder, the Crown joint venture will overlap some easier comparisons in the second half of the year. ", "Now, before I move on, I want to briefly comment on a recent beer industry speculation regarding InBev, Anheuser-Busch and others and how it might impact Constellation's investment in the Crown imports JV. Regardless of which scenario plays out, Constellation's contract with Modelo for the Crown JV remains intact, as is through the initial term 2016, ending 2016, that is. At that time, there are three potential outcomes as it relates to our contract with Modelo. They are as follows: Modelo can renew the contract, number one; number two, if Modelo decides that they would like to partner with another third party to import and market their portfolio in the U.S., they must pay Constellation our 50% share of eight times EBIT; number three, if Modelo elects to become a self-importer and is not prohibited from doing so by either federal or state regulatory authorities, then they would pay us our 50% share of tangible book value. ", "At this time, I would also like to reiterate our assessment regarding the impact of the economic downturn on our business and the overall beverage alcohol category, as I\u2019m frequently asked this question. From an economic perspective, there have been some venue shift from on-premise consumption to off-premise consumption. Within the off-premise channel, we are also seeing a shift to discount retailers, including large mass merchants and wholesale club stores. We remain generally insulated from the impact of these venue shifts because we sell directly to the distributors here in the U.S. at the same margin, regardless of the end user consumption. ", "The total beverage alcohol category grew 4% for the latest 52-week IRI period, which is in line with the average industry growth rate for the past four years, and the growth trends for beer, wine, and spirits category, which comprise the total beverage alcohol segment has not varied significantly during the last 12 months, with the wine segment growing at a rate greater than that of beer and spirits. ", "Now, to further demonstrate my point, let\u2019s look at the 12 and 52-week IRI industry trends. In the wine segment, 12-week IRI value trends for the period ending May 18th are as follows: total wine up 5%; premium wine, up 7%; and super premium wine, which is greater than $8 at retail, is up 12%. The 52-week IRI trends almost exactly mirror the 12-week trends for the total wine, premium, and super premium wine categories. As you can see, the super premium plus wine segment, where Constellation has the leading market share, has experienced double-digit growth, exceeding the trends of the total U.S. wine segment. We are well-positioned in this category due to our continued premiumization efforts. ", "The results are similar in the spirits category, with premium spirits growing 4% on a value basis for both the 12- and 52-week IRI periods. And imported beer continued to grow at an industry growth rate of 2% to 3% for both timeframes. ", "While we are all aware of the economic challenges impacting many industries, beverage alcohol products are not expected to be as significantly impacted as other consumer discretionary goods. ", "In closing, our momentum continues for many of the strategic actions we have undertaken during the last 12 months. We are off to a great start in fiscal 2009 and we are on track to achieve our goals and objectives for the year. ", "And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our CFO, Bob Ryder, for a financial discussion of our first quarter business results. Bob. ", "Robert P. Ryder", "Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Overall, I am pleased with our start to the year and our results for the quarter, with comparable basis diluted EPS coming in at $0.34 versus $0.21 last year. This was in line with our expectations and puts us on a path to achieving our full-year goal of $1.68 to $1.76. We used $55 million of free cash flow in Q1 versus a use of $104 million for the prior year, and we are still on track to reach our $310 million to $340 million free cash flow goal for fiscal 2009. As a reminder, historically we are a net user of cash in the first quarter. ", "We believe our Q1 results demonstrate that the many significant steps we have taken over the past 12 to 15 months have increased our profit generation profile to drive improved financial results in fiscal 2009 and beyond. ", "Now let\u2019s look at our Q1 fiscal 2009 P&L performance, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Let\u2019s look at net sales. As you can see from our news release on page 13, our consolidated reported net sales increased 3%, primarily reflecting branded wine growth, including the net benefit of adding brands like Clos du Bois and Wild Horse, and divesting Almaden and Inglenook. We also saw favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by the impact of moving the U.K. wholesale business to the Matthew Clarke joint venture. ", "The growth rate was 16% after excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and joint ventures, and 13% on an organic constant currency basis. This strong growth rate includes the benefits of overlapping our initiative to reduce distributor wine inventories in the U.S., which negatively impacted net sales in the first and second quarters of fiscal \u201908. ", "Commentary for the following net sales comparisons will be on a constant currency basis. Worldwide branded wine organic net sales increased 15%. Organic branded wine geographic net sales for North America, which appears on page 12 of the release, increased 28%, reflecting the overlap of reducing U.S. distributor wine inventory levels last year and solid underlying growth in both the U.S. and Canada this year. ", "Branded wine organic net sales for Europe and Australia/New Zealand decreased 6% and 3% respectively. For our international business, we have implemented price increases that have impacted volume growth in the near-term but have enhanced overall margins and profitability. Volumes in these geographies were also impacted by SKU reductions of certain lower margin brands. ", "Turning our attention to spirit, net sales increased 9%, driven by strong double-digit growth of the SVEDKA Vodka brand. As discussed in our fiscal \u201908 year-end conference call, we estimated that last year\u2019s distributor inventory reduction initiatives had a one-time impact of $110 million to net sales and comparable EPS impact of about $0.15, with approximately 75% of that impact, or $80 million of net sales and $0.11 of EPS coming in the first quarter and the remainder hitting in Q2. ", "Adjusting for this estimated $80 million net sales impact for the distributor inventory initiative in Q1 last year, we estimate consolidated organic net sales on a constant-currency basis grew in the low single digits. This is a little below our mid-single-digit target due to the lower U.K. and Australia/New Zealand sales performance for the reasons I just discussed. However, North American organic branded wine on a constant currency basis grew in the mid-single-digits, after adjusting for the distributor inventory impacts. ", "Now let\u2019s look at our profits on a comparable basis using information on page 14 of the release. For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 36.4%, up 6.1 percentage points. This reflects the benefits of implementing price increases on our North American and international markets, and product mix shift from adding high margin brands like Clos du Bois and Wild Horse and divesting lower margin Almaden and Inglenook brands. The overlap of the distributor inventory initiative also provided operating leverage versus the first quarter last year. We also experienced favorability from shifting the lower margin U.K. wholesale business to a joint venture structure last April. ", "Our consolidated SG&A for the quarter was 22.3% of net sales compared to 21.2% a year ago. This increase reflects moving below our SG&A U.K. wholesale business to a joint venture structure and increase marketing investment behind our premium spirits brands. This was partially offset by the impact of lapping the distributor inventory initiative. Consolidated operating income increased to $131 million from $82 million for the prior year. ", "I would now like to turn to our segment operating income results on page 11 of the release to provide highlights of this change. Wine segment operating income increased $58 million to $145 million. This was primarily due to higher net sales as we overlapped the reduction of the U.S. distributor wine inventories, contributions from the Clos du Bois and Wild Horse brands, and profitability improvement in the international businesses. ", "For the spirits segment, operating income decreased $5 million primarily due to the higher investment behind our premium brands discussed earlier and higher raw material costs. For the quarter, corporate and other expenses totaled $24 million, compared to $20 million for the prior year. The increase primarily includes higher consulting service fees associated with our review of our Australian business and other process improvement opportunities, as well as additional costs to support the growth of the company. ", "Equity investment earnings totaled $72 million versus $76 million last year, with $70 million coming from our Crown import investment, compared to $73 million in the prior year. For the first quarter, Crown generated net sales of $673 million, an increase of 2%, and operating income of $139 million, a decrease of 5%. The operating income decrease was driven by the year-over-year timing of marketing activities and an increase in product costs. ", "As a reminder, the joint venture agreement calls for a limited annual inflationary increase for the cost of products acquired from the Grupo Modelo company through calendar 2011.  ", "Interest expense for the quarter was $87 million, up 9% over last year. The increase primarily reflects the incremental interest from funding the Beam Wine brand acquisition. ", "Now let\u2019s take a look at our debt. At the end of May, our debt totaled $5.3 billion, which was fairly consistent with our debt at the end of fiscal \u201908. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.6 billion of bank debt under our senior credit facility and $2.7 billion of fixed term and other debt. Our average interest rate for the first quarter was around 6.5%. We had $580 million of revolving credit available under our senior facility at the end of May. Our debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio at the end of May was 5.1 times. This ratio improved from the 5.3 times level at the end of February, reflecting our earnings improvement. ", "In early June, we received $209 million in proceeds from the sale of certain winery assets, which renew [inaudible] borrowings. If these asset sales had occurred before the end of Q1, our debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio would have been around 4.9 times. ", "With the strong free cash flow and earnings improvement planned for fiscal 2009, combined with the asset sale proceeds just mentioned, we now believe we can reduce this ratio to below four times range by the end of fiscal 2009. Our previous guidance was in the low to mid four times range. ", "Our comparable basis tax rate came in at 37%, in line with our targeted full year tax rate, and compared to a 38.3% rate last year. Our weighted averaged diluted shares outstanding for the quarter totaled $219 million, compared to $233 million last year, reflecting the benefit from the share repurchase during the first quarter of last year. ", "Due to the many factors just mentioned, diluted EPS was $0.34 a share versus $0.21 a share last year. ", "Now let\u2019s turn to cash flow on page 10. For purposes of this discussion, free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activity less CapEx. For the first quarter, we used free cash flow of $55 million, versus a use of $104 million in the prior year. The lower use reflects improved earnings and increased distributions from the Crown imports JV versus the prior year first quarter. ", "We saw higher inventory in the first quarter due to an increase in our Australian harvest intake. Accounts payable was also higher as some of the payments from the harvest will occur in Q2 versus last year when the payments incurred in Q1 as a result of an earlier harvest. Accounts receivable was also higher as we lapped the distributor inventory reduction. ", "As mentioned earlier, for fiscal 2009 we are targeting free cash flow to be in the range of $310 million to $340 million. This includes CapEx in the range of $150 million to $170 million. ", "Moving to our P&L outlook for the full year 2009, we are forecasting comparable basis diluted EPS in the range of 168 to 176. As reflected in the outlook section of the press release, we expect reported net sales to increase in mid-single-digits. Interest expense is expected to be in the range of $335 million to $345 million, and we are assuming weighted average diluted shares of approximately $222 million. ", "Our comparable basis guidance excludes acquisition related integration costs, restructuring charges, and unusual items, which are detailed on page 16 of the news release. ", "I believe our results for Q1 and our full year goals demonstrate our overall focus on improving our sales mix, increasing operating efficiencies, and implementing pricing to offset input cost inflation and to enhance overall margins and profitability, generating strong free cash flow and paying down debt.  ", "With that, we are happy to take your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Tim Ramey of D. A. Davidson. ", "Timothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co. ", "Good morning. Congratulations on a great quarter. I\u2019m sorry, I think you said this and I missed it, but the comparable line sales excluding the impact to the inventory draw-down was what in the quarter?", "Robert P. Ryder", "It was around mid-single-digits in North America. ", "Timothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co. ", "Okay, and there\u2019s still some of the impact of the draw-down that will fall into the 2Q. Can you help us for our modeling purposes?", "Robert P. Ryder", "It will be about $30 million in Q2, because about three quarters of last year\u2019s $110 million occurred in the first quarter, so what\u2019s left is around $30 million of sales and about $0.04 of EPS for Q2. ", "Timothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co. ", "Great. Appreciate it. And you know, there\u2019s -- I was on CNBC this morning getting asked whether you guys would buy pieces of Foster or [Derringer]. I think you made a strong case here and on the road with me that your focus is on hunkering down. Can I get you to repeat that one more time, hunker down and pay down debt? ", "Robert S. Sands", "Well, Tim, clearly our focus is on hunkering down and paying down debt, so it is as we have said, which is we are focused on generating internal efficiencies, improving free cash flow, improving ROIC and paying down debt. So these are key initiatives for our management team. ", "Robert P. Ryder", "And I think you saw that in the first quarter. That\u2019s what we did. ", "Timothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co. ", "That\u2019s terrific. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Torres with HSBC.", "Lauren Torres - HSBC ", "Good morning. I was hoping you could be a bit more specific with respect to the price increases that you took in the quarter -- any sense of the magnitude or give us a sense of how much of an increase you took, where you took it, and also just going forward, is there more to come or you pretty much took as much as you can, or as I said, take more going into the second quarter?", "Robert P. Ryder", "It varied a little bit by geography but I\u2019d say in the U.S. in the wine business, it was probably around 3% kind of pricing, and expected at -- it had a bit of a volume hit and it will take a while to build out of that. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re looking at significant pricing in the balance of the year in North America for wine. Spirits also took pricing in the first quarter and I think they are looking, because they have a little bit more input cost inflation, they are looking to take some additional pricing [down into the year]. And as we talked internationally, the U.K. originally had their pricing increase. It was around again 3% to 4% but then when the duty came in, they actually increased it to match the duty, so I think they are pretty much done with their pricing for the year. And Australia also took some pretty significant pricing in the first quarter, like 5% to 7%, and I think they are looking at maybe taking some additional pricing balance of the year because as Rob had said, they had to pay a bit more for grapes this year because of farmers had to buy a lot of water, which is reflected in our cost of goods sold. ", "And again, we\u2019re trying to balance improving our margins and using pricing to do that [with] the volume impact of that, because when we price we certainly see some volume reductions, but on a worldwide basis certainly in the wine business, the supply of grapes is pretty much matched up with the demand for them, so we do think there\u2019s -- this is the right time to do what we are doing. ", "Lauren Torres - HSBC ", "And you said there was a volume hit with respect to U.S. wine. How much of a hit was that?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Well, I think we -- for volumes, we were a little bit light on the prices on the products that we price, and I think the two brands specifically, if you look at IRI, where share probably is keeping pace is a brand called Vendange and Clos du Bois. And Vendange is sort of a lower end brand, so it tends to be more price sensitive, and we\u2019re managing it more for profitability versus share of market. And in the Clos du Bois, and I think we mentioned on previous calls, we took -- actually, the previous owner took about 6% to 7% pricing at the end of the calendar year. That\u2019s a pretty significant price increase for a wine brand, so the volume on that have actually taken a hit commensurate with that. But as we get further past that price increase, and we\u2019re like in month six, we see the volumes beginning to recover there and our market share beginning to recover as well. ", "Lauren Torres - HSBC ", "And are you seeing your competitors take some more pricing?", "Robert P. Ryder", "We are seeing pricing across the marketplace and pretty much in all of the geographies. Everybody is under the same pressures we are and I think everybody else sees the same supply/demand dynamics that we see. ", "Lauren Torres - HSBC ", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Brian Hunt of Wachovia. ", "Brian Hunt - Wachovia ", "Thank you. In line with your focus to hunker down and generate free cash, looking at your target of 310 to 340, it appears that there\u2019s a significant amount of opportunity in working capital. Could you talk about your working capital targets for the year and how much the 310 to 340 comes from working capital benefit?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yeah, I\u2019d say in general we are much more focused on generating cash flow as a company. I\u2019ll say a couple of things around that. Number one, I think the results show that. If you look at fiscal \u201908 and fiscal \u201909 and sort of average it, we\u2019d be generating about $350 million a year, which I think is much higher than we\u2019ve generated historically. At the New York investors conference, I think I said that as a company we\u2019re trying to increase the EBIT flow-through to free cash flow, which over the last three years has probably been in the mid 30% range. We are trying to get that to sort of the mid-40% range, meaning the amount of EBIT that as a percent of free cash flow. We\u2019ve changed the incentive within the company, so that people -- part of their bonus metric is now based on free cash flow and we are seeing some -- a much increased opportunity, a much increased focus on generating free cash flow because you know, if you look at our balance sheet, we have a sizable investment in net working capital. The big investment is in inventory, of course, and I think we\u2019ve -- you know, you\u2019ve seen some activities to improve that, like reducing less profitable SKUs because when you look at it from a return on capital perspective, it\u2019s difficult for those SKUs, because they are lower margin and they sort of tie up a lot of working capital, generate -- it\u2019s difficult for them to return the cost of capital. ", "So we\u2019re not giving specific working capital goals but I think you will see it as we proceed and I think you are seeing it in the bottom line as we speak. ", "Brian Hunt - Wachovia ", "Okay. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Nicolaus.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus ", "A question about Canada, which is doing very well, I think you said up double-digits in the quarter; can you give us a little more detail on what\u2019s going on there? And of course, with an [inaudible] towards sustainability, give us an idea of growth you see in the market going forward. ", "Robert S. Sands", "Yeah, Mark, you know, Canada is in general a great market for us. People are consuming more wine as the -- the consumers are very loyal to Canadian wines. There\u2019s big trading up going on into the EQA segment, and in general it just remains a strong market. I would say that we don\u2019t see that abating for any particular reason. I think that the trends are pretty firmly intact and I think we should continue to see, continue to enjoy favorable trends. ", "Our portfolio is really well-positioned in terms of the products that we have to take advantage of those trends, so we are pretty optimistic about the market. ", "Robert P. Ryder", "Just the other thing on this, we are the market share leader up there. It\u2019s a country which actually some countries in Europe are looking at, it has a minimum net pricing so it tends to help the brand owner and there\u2019s a big opportunity there, big market shift towards imported new [world] lines, so from Australia, New Zealand, and the U.S. And we are very well situated to take advantage of that opportunity. ", "So we see, albeit it\u2019s not a huge market, especially compared to the U.S., but we see  some pretty good opportunities for Canada going forward. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus ", "And when you say growth not abating, what\u2019s really driving my question is it\u2019s not normally low double-digit kind of growth there, so do you see low double-digit sustained? And is that distribution, is that new products -- I mean, what\u2019s -- obviously it appears you are taking share. I\u2019m just trying to understand what\u2019s up-ticking there. ", "Robert P. Ryder", "I think in general, Canada, you know, the market probably grows 5% to 7%, so I think you are right; this quarter, I don\u2019t think we\u2019d expect double-digit growth going forward. There\u2019s some timing impacts there but it\u2019s a strong top line in Canada and we expect to take advantage of that. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus ", "And can you help us just connect the dots between the market and the growth you saw in the quarter? What besides what you have in the release in terms of the named brands really changed there?", "Robert S. Sands", "We can get back to Patty or Bob on some specifics on that, Mark. You know, it\u2019s a combination of factors, new SKUs and product introductions, things to that effect. I think as much as Bob told you that we probably would expect growth in Canada to be in excess of U.S. growth, probably mid to high single digits but we\u2019re not going to project sustained double-digit growth, so I\u2019d be -- that\u2019s what you should probably take away from now. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus ", "Great. Thanks, guys. ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Banc of America.", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America ", "Good morning. Just a couple of questions, or a question, I guess, regarding some of your cost saving initiatives and efforts to improve return on capital. First I guess, you had mentioned at the analyst day a program to reduce SKUs, eliminate some lower margin or lower turn brands, so if you could talk a little bit about how that -- if that had any impact on your sales in the quarter. ", "And then second, if you guys could just talk a bit about where you stand now in terms of your project list -- you know, what\u2019s currently being worked on and then what you have sort of in the pipeline with certain initiatives to continue to boost your turns and grow margin. ", "Robert S. Sands", "Brian, first of all, as I mentioned in my talk, we discontinued in our value segment about 50 brands, about 1,600 SKUs. That\u2019s only one of the factors that has impacted our sales growth. Even though our sales growth in North America, by the way, in general is well in line with targets, notwithstanding the fact that it\u2019s been impacted by the couple of things Bob mentioned -- Clos du Bois pricing, the way that we are managing the Vendange brand, and the third item is the fact that we now don\u2019t have those 50 brands flowing through as well. But nevertheless, on a purely organic basis, taking into account the distributor inventory reduction, even including these factors we\u2019re growing the business in North America at about a 5% rate, which is exactly consistent with our mid-single-digit growth. ", "We\u2019ve got lots of initiatives to reduce cost of goods sold. I think a good example of that is our recently announced disposition of our Valley Fields facility, primarily a contract production facility, although maybe about 20% of it in various ways was utilized for our products. We\u2019ve got a brand new modern facility in Lethbridge, Canada in Alberta that we can consolidate production into, so these are the kind of moves that we continue to make to boost margins, to improve ROIC. ", "The disposition of the brands that we recently announced that we are selling, there again -- you know, we\u2019ve developed what I\u2019ll call a disposition discipline, okay? If we\u2019ve got brands that we don\u2019t see are strategic, that we believe can be sold in excess of the net present value of our forecasted cash flows of those brands at our [inaudible], you know, those are the kinds of ROIC improvement initiatives that we are undertaking. ", "Bob, do you have anything to add?", "Robert P. Ryder", "No, I think the other thing we talked about, Brian, is -- and it relates back to the, you know, some of the projects in which we are working, is we are looking pretty intently at our Australian business and looking at sort of the return on capital and profitability by brand and actually by SKU, and that will most likely result in some reductions to the SKU count on brands that can\u2019t return their cost of capital. And that should improve our margins down there and should improve our working capital, as we have just fewer things hanging around the warehouse. And I think that, coupled with the pricing we have already taken and maybe some additional pricing we\u2019ll be looking at balance of year, should improve our profitability in both Australia and the U.K. ", "So I think, you know, there\u2019s some of the things that we are looking at. ", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America ", "Great. Thanks, guys. ", "Operator", "Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back to Rob Sands for any closing comments. ", "Robert S. Sands", "Okay, well thank you, everybody, for joining our call today. We\u2019re very pleased with our results for the quarter. As I mentioned, I think that we are off to a great start for fiscal 2009 and I believe we are well-positioned to achieve our free cash flow and EPS goals for the year. Our recent actions demonstrate that we continue to execute our strategies. A few examples include the divestiture of the California northwest assets that I just talked about. Of course, we used those proceeds to pay down debt. We have realized pricing and thus increased profitability in our international markets where we have a strong presence. And overall, we planned continued margin expansion and ROIC enhancement as we drive internal efficiencies and further premiumize our portfolio.

(Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. ", "Patty Yahn-Urlaub", "", "Welcome to Constellation's second quarter fiscal 2009 conference call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer. ", "By now you should have had an opportunity to read our news release, which has also been furnished to the SEC. This conference call is intended to complement the release. ", "During the call we will discuss financial information on a GAAP-comparable, organic and constant currency basis. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company's at www.cbrands.com under the Investor section. These reconciliations include explanations as to why management uses the non-GAAP financial measures and why management believes they are useful to investors. ", "Discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results excluding acquisition-related costs, restructuring and related charges, and unusual items. We will also discuss organic net sales information, which is defined in the news release, and constant currency net sales information which excludes the impact of year-over-year currency exchange rate fluctuations. ", "Please be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may affect the company's estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings.", "Thanks, and now I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.", "Robert S. Sands", "", "Welcome to our discussion of Constellation's second quarter sales and earnings results. We are pleased with our quarterly results, which were in line with our expectations and clearly demonstrate that we are on track to achieve our fiscal 2009 financial goals.", "In second quarter, we generated strong free cash flow, significantly reduced our debt, improved our comparable basis operating margin and ROIC, and reaffirmed our comparable EPS guidance for the year. We are particularly pleased with our ability to rapidly deleverage using a combination of free cash flow and proceeds from the sale of assets.", "From an operational perspective, we improved operating margins for both our Wine and Spirits businesses by improving our sales mix and increasing prices to offset rising input costs. Collectively, these actions have been completed during a time of increasing financial market volatility and ongoing competitive challenges in some key markets.", "During the quarter, we began the process of right-sizing our Australian wine operation, which includes the planned sale of production facilities and vineyard properties, consolidation of bottling operations, and the rationalization of our extensive portfolio with the elimination of more than 30% of our SKUs. This initiative is part of our ongoing effort to enhance operating efficiencies and improve cash flow and return on invested capital. ", "In the second quarter, we also sold U.S. wine brands and assets that were acquired with the Clos du Bois\u00a0transaction as well as some of our Pacific Northwest facilities and brands from Washington State and Idaho. We received more than $200\u00a0million in proceeds from the sale of these assets, which were used to reduce debt during the quarter.", "Now looking at our U.S. Wine business, this will be the last period that we will be comparing for the cycling of our fiscal 2008 U.S. distributor wine inventory reduction initiative, which benefited this year's second quarter results by approximately $30 million in sales and $0.04 in EPS. Above and beyond this benefit, we've continued to improve the EBIT of the U.S. wine business as a result of the favorable product mix created from the acquisition of higher-profit premium brands, the divestiture of lower-margin value brands, and the resulting synergies generated by this ongoing portfolio transformation. Nevertheless, sales for our U.S. Wine business for the quarter were a bit below our expectations for the following reasons:", "First, we've seen a slight slowing of U.S. wine category market growth, although current growth levels remain solid.", "Second, in an ongoing effort to enhance the profitability of the business, we have taken the lead in increasing prices across the majority of our wine portfolio in the U.S. These pricing actions have resulted in increased profitability in the form of overall margin improvement and enhanced ROIC for our U.S. Wine business, although volumes have been unfavorably impacted in the short term. ", "Despite the slowing market growth trend I just mentioned, according to the recent 12-week IRI data, the U.S. premium plus wine market remains healthy, at a growth rate of mid single digits. And many of our premium plus brands are exceeding this market growth trend, including Woodbridge, Estancia, Toasted Head, Simi, Kim Crawford, and the recently acquired Wild Horse brand, all of which posted strong growth during the latest 12-week IRI reporting period. ", "As expected the sales growth trajectory of our U.S. wine portfolio has been impacted by the ongoing brand and SKU rationalization currently under way for our value wine portfolio. Upon completion of this initiative, we will have discontinued more than 25% of the SKUs in our total U.S. wine portfolio. Although this represents a small number of cases, it is expected to negatively impact the growth rate of our portfolio by more than 2% in fiscal 2009. ", "We expect our sales growth for the U.S. Wine business to return to levels that are more consistent with market growth as we lap price increases and our SKU rationalization initiative and we complete the integration and restructuring activity associated with our recent acquisitions and divestitures. ", "From a U.S. wine marketing perspective, we will be launching a new Robert Mondavi\u00a0brand equity campaign to honor the legacy of the iconic California wine pioneer, Robert Mondavi. As you know, the Robert Mondavi brand has become one of the most important, recognized and valuable brand franchises in the world. We are taking this opportunity to leverage the tremendous power of the franchise with new brand positioning and a new print campaign. This initiative will become visible in the market in the coming weeks.", "As is typical at this point of the year, I'd like to provide an update relating to the U.S. grape progress, which is almost 75% complete at this point. This year's harvest is expected to produce quality output despite a spring frost, extended summer heat, and extreme winds during the bloom period. Although there are divergent estimates from varying sources relative to the expected size of this year's harvest, we are currently estimating that the 2008 U.S. industry harvest may potentially decline as much as mid single digits from last year's harvest.", "Prices for grapes are expected to increase in the high single-digit range, reflecting tightening supply for key varietals, the Pinot Grigio, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, and Cabernet. Overall, these trends are expected to keep supply and demand generally in balance, with a bias towards tightening supply. Although we may feel some pressure from a COGS perspective, we expect a more favorable pricing environment to more than offset these COGS increases. ", "Our Canadian Wine business posted strong results for the second quarter, primarily reflecting sales growth from our premium portfolio, led by brands such as Jackson-Triggs, Inniskillin and Naked Grape. ", "Although conditions remain challenging in our international Wine business, we are working toward increasing the overall profitability of this business by taking pricing, although doing so has negatively impacted volume. We are well positioned with retailers for the upcoming holiday selling season in our key international market and we are progressing as planned with our business realignment activities in Australia. I'd like to reiterate that the U.K. and Australian-New Zealand market combined currently represent 10% of our total company EBIT and should, therefore, not cause a significant amount of operational volatility. ", "During the second quarter, the Spirits segment posted increased sales and operating profit, driven primarily by strong double-digit top line and market growth for premium products, including SVEDKA Vodka, Black Velvet Canadian Whisky, and Effen Vodka. In addition, Ridgemont Reserve 1792 Bourbon, 99 Schnapps, Caravella and Meukow Cognac also delivered solid sales performance. The strong momentum surrounding SVEDKA continues to build from increased distribution points and promotional activities as well as continued expansion outside the U.S. ", "During the quarter, we also closed on the sale of our Valleyfield, Quebec facility, which was primarily a contract production site for other suppliers. ", "These efforts streamline operations, improve efficiencies and allow us to eliminate excess capacity while reducing costs and enhancing ROIC. ", "Moving to the Crown Imports joint venture. The Crown portfolio generated 1% net sales growth in the second quarter. Strong sales for Corona Light and Modelo Especial, Negra Modelo and Pacifico products were offset by weaker trends for Corona Extra, which continues to be impacted by adverse economic conditions in large Corona markets, including California, Arizona and Florida. As we discussed, there has also been competitive product introductions tied to the Corona brand which may have had some impact during the summer selling season. However, the continued success of these product introductions remain uncertain with the close of the summer. ", "We are expecting improving results for Crown in the second half of the year as we lap easier comparisons. In addition, most competitors have publicly indicated that they will begin to increase prices in order to offset rising input costs. We expect these activities to better align price gaps versus competition at more normalized levels as the significant price discounting which permeated the summer selling season is expected to dissipate. New product introductions are expected to increase our share of shelf space at retail. They include the Corona 18-pack, the Corona Light tall can and [Coranedo] Light, and we are currently market testing Modelo Especial and Negra Modelo draft in selected U.S. cities. ", "We'd originally estimated Crown depletion rates for fiscal 2009 in the mid single-digit range. Now that we have reached the halfway point for the year, we are revising our depletion estimate for fiscal 2009 to a rate that is about flat to slightly positive. Despite this revision, I want to reiterate that the Crown portfolio is healthy, execution at retail is strong, with several promotional activities, market programs and new product introductions in place for the remainder of the year. In September, we have begun to see positive growth trends for the entire Crown portfolio, with Corona Extra returning to growth and other brands growing at high single-digit rates. ", "Now before I turn the call over to Bob, I'd like to address the issue of rising input costs as I'm frequently asked about the magnitude of this impact on our business. As you know, grape purchases represent approximately 40% to 50% of our COGS spend. The cost drivers for this agricultural business are generally unrelated to the current macro factors affecting other COGS components, such as higher energy costs. We currently contract approximately 90% of our grape meat from grape suppliers around the world. Packaging represents the next largest COGS component, including glass, labels and closures, followed by transportation costs, many of which have obviously been impacted by rising energy costs. ", "Overall, we estimate that rising input costs have negatively impacted our COGS in the single-digit range; however, we have increased at a rate that offsets the unfavorable cost impact. ", "In closing, I'm pleased with the results in the second quarter. We continue to execute on all fronts, both tactically and strategically, despite challenges from marketplace dynamics. We are entering our strongest seasonal period and believe we are well positioned to achieve our goals for the year.", "And now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Ryder for a financial discussion of our second quarter business results. ", "Robert P. Ryder", "", "Our comparable basis diluted EPS came in at $0.45 versus $0.35 last year. This, combined with our Q1 results, puts us on a path to achieving our full year EPS goal of $1.68 to $1.76. ", "We generated $125 million of free cash flow in the first half of the year and remain on track to reach our $310 to $340\u00a0million free cash flow goal for fiscal 2009. ", "Our deleveraging efforts have driven more than a $400 million decrease in our total debt level since fiscal 2008 year end. ", "Now let's look at our Q2 fiscal 2009 P&L performance, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. ", "First, net sales. As you can see from our news release on Page 13, our consolidated reported net sales increased 7%, primarily reflecting [inaudible] wine sales, including the net benefit of adding brands like [inaudible] and Wild Horse and divesting [inaudible] and certain Pacific Northwest wine brands. ", "On an organic constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, the growth rate was 6%. This growth rate includes the benefit of overlapping our initiatives to reduce distributor wine inventories in the U.S., which negatively impacted net sales in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2008.", "My commentary for the following net sales comparisons will be on a constant currency basis:", "Our worldwide branded wine organic net sales increased 4%. Organic branded wine geographic net sales for North America, which appears on Page 12 of the release, increased 7%. This reflects the overlap of reducing U.S. wine distributor level last year and solid growth in Canada.", "Branded wine organic net sales for Europe and Australia-New Zealand decreased 3% and 1%, respectively. To improve margins and enhance our ROIC for our international businesses, we have been implementing price increases which have impacted volume growth in the near term.", "In the U.K., we implemented a mid single-digit price increase in January to cover cost increases and followed that up with another increase in March to offset the U.K. duty increase. These actions have been supported with increased marketing investments.", "In Australia, we also increased prices last March in the mid single-digit range after we had already reduced some of our price promotion activity. Volumes in these geographies were also impacted by skew reductions of certain lower-margin brands related to our business restructuring and realizing activities for our New Zealand operations. We expect to see some negative impact on volumes from the skew reductions for the balance of the fiscal year. The markets remain very challenging and the pricing environment is quite tight.  ", "Turning our attention to Spirits, net sales increased 4%, led by double-digit growth from SVEDKA Vodka, Black Velvet Whisky and Effen Vodka brands. As discussed in our recent conference calls, we estimated the [inaudible] to distributor inventory reduction initiative had a one-time impact of $110 million to net sales and comparable EPS impact of about $0.15. Approximately 25% of that impact - or about $30 million net sales and $0.04 for EPS\u00a0 came in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. ", "Adjusting for the $30 million net sales impact in Q2 last year, we estimate consolidated organic net sales on a constant currency basis grew in the low single digits. This is a little bit below our mid single-digit target, due in part to the lower U.K. and Australia-New Zealand sale performance for the regions I just discussed. ", "North American organic branded wine on a constant currency basis grew in the low single digits after adjusting for the distributor inventory impact. And volumes in the U.S. have also been impacted by the near-term skew reductions and price increases. ", "Now let's look at our profit on a comparable basis using information from Page 14 of the release.", "For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 37.6%, up an impressive 2.4\u00a0percentage points. This reflects the benefits of implementing price increases in our North American and international markets and favorable product mix shift from adding the higher margin brands like [inaudible] and divesting the lower-margin [inaudible] brands. The overlap of the distributor inventory initiative also provided a bit of operating leverage versus the second quarter last year. These activities should drive a long-term improvement to Constellation's profit profile and reflect the benefits of our [premiere-ization] strategy.", "Our consolidated SG&A for the quarter was 22.4% of net sales compared with 21.2% a year ago. This increase reflects increased marketing investments behind branded wine in the U.K., hedging [inaudible] and higher costs for stock compensation and professional services. This was partially offset by the impact of lapping the distributor inventory initiative. ", "Consolidated operating income increased to $146 million from $125 million for the prior year, and our operating margin increased 1.3 percentage points to 15.3%. ", "I'd now like to turn to our segment operating income results on Page 11 of the release and to [inaudible] highlights of these changes. ", "Wine segment operating income increased $24 million to $149 million. This was primarily due to the contributions of [inaudible] and Wild Horse brands, including related synergies, in higher net sales as we overlap the reduction of U.S. distributor wine inventories. These benefits were partially offset by the divestiture of Almaden, Inglenook, and certain Pacific Northwest wine brands.", "For the Spirits segment, operating income increased $2 million and operating margin increased 1.5 percentage points. This reflects positive mix shift and reduced SG&A. ", "For the quarter, Corporate [inaudible] expenses totaled $26 million compared with $21 million for the prior year. The increase primarily includes higher consultant fees associated with [inaudible] Australian business and other prospects of [inaudible] opportunity, stock compensation expense, as well as additional costs to support the growth of the company. ", "Equity investment earnings of Crown totaled $74 million compared to $79 million in the prior year. For the second quarter, Crown generated net sales of $732 million, an increase of 1%, and operating income of $149 million, a decrease of 5%. The operating income decrease was primarily driven by contractual increases in product costs and year-over-year timing of marketing activity. As a reminder, over the first five years of the initial 10-year term, the joint venture agreement calls for an annual increase in the [cost] of products acquired from [inaudible] Modelo, which we believe are below [inaudible] inflationary levels. ", "Interest expense for the quarter was $81 million, down 7% over last year. The decrease primarily reflects a decrease in our average interest rate during Q2 versus the prior year quarter. ", "Now let's take a look at our debt. At the end of August, our debt totaled $4.8 million, which represents a $420\u00a0million decrease of our debt level at the end of fiscal 2008. The decrease as primarily driven by $204\u00a0million net proceeds received in early June from the sale of certain winery assets and our free cash flow generation. At the end of the quarter we had approximately $2.3 billion of bank debt under our senior credit facility and $2.5\u00a0billion fixed term and other debt. Our average interest rate for the second quarter was around 6.3%. ", "We had $845 million of revolving credit under our senior facility at the end of August. We believe there is no issue accessing this facility, which is in place through June 2011. The next significant funding requirement is the maturity of 155 million of pound sterling notes due in November '09. ", "We continue to deleverage at a rapid pace, as our debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio at the end of August was 4.6 times versus the 5.3 times level at the end of February. This reflects our commitment to price improvement and debt reduction. With the strong free cash flow and earnings improvement plan for fiscal 2009 combined with the asset sale proceeds just mentioned, we continue to believe we can reduce this ratio to the low 4 times range by the end of fiscal 2009. ", "Our comparable basis tax rate came in at 29% compared to 35% last year. The lower rate drove some favorability in the quarter and reflects the settlement of certain tax positions during the second quarter. This benefit was already factored in our full year tax rate projections, as we continue to project our full year comparable base rate to approximate 37%. ", "Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter totaled $229\u00a0million compared to $209 million last year. Due to the many factors just mentioned, diluted EPS was $0.45 a share versus $0.35 last year. ", "Now let's turn to cash flow on Page 10 of the news release. For purposes of this discussion, free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less Capex. For the first half of '09, we generated free cash flow of $125\u00a0million versus $131 in the prior year. Net cash from operating activities was consistent with last year, and the increase in net income plus non-cash items was offset by a higher net use of working capital. ", "We have seen higher inventory through an increase in our Southern hemisphere harvest intake and higher accounts receivable as they increase sales versus the prior year. ", "Additionally, Capex for the first half of '09 totaled $52\u00a0million compared to $47 million for the same period last year. ", "As mentioned earlier, in fiscal '09 we are targeting free cash flows in the range of $310 to $340 million. This includes Capex in the range of $150 to $170 million. ", "Moving toward P&L outlook for the full year, we are reiterating our comparable basis EPS forecast in the range of $1.68 to $1.76. As reflected in the outlook section of the press release, we expect reported net sales to increase mid single digits and organic net sales to increase mid to high single digits. This includes the benefit of lapping the distributor inventory reduction initiative. ", "Due to favorability in average debt balances, interest expense is now expected to be in the range of $325 to $335\u00a0million versus our previous guidance of $335 to $345. This improvement essentially offsets the impact of the lower growth target for [inaudible] discussed earlier by Rob.", "Assuming weighted average diluted shares to approximate 222 million, our comparable basis guidance excludes acquisition-related integration costs, restructuring charges and unusual items, which are detailed on Page\u00a017 of the news release. ", "During the second quarter, we recorded approximately $129 million or $122 million after tax of charges and write downs. $109 million of the pre-tax charges was associated with the previously announced business realignment activities for our Australian operations. This included $48 million of inventory write downs, $26\u00a0million for impairment of intangible assets and an equity method investment, and $35 million of restructuring and other charges. All but a couple million of these charges were non-cash. ", "In addition, we recorded a non-cash loss of $8 million on the sale of our Valleyfield [inaudible] end of Q2. This was primarily why we revised our FY '09 reported guidance by $0.03.", "The remaining charges recorded in the quarter were primarily related to other previously announced restructuring and business realignment activities. ", "Before we take a look at your questions, I would like [you to know that I believe] our actions and results for the first half of the year, combined with our full year goal, continued to demonstrate our overall focus on one, improving our sales mix, increasing operating efficiencies, and implementing prices to offset input cost inflation and enhance overall margin and productivity. Our Q2 and year-to-date operating margin improve 1.3 and 3.1 percentage points, respectively, demonstrating number one.", "Two, generating strong free cash flow. We are maintaining our guidance of $310 to $340 million after producing strong free cash flow results last year.", "And three, paying down debt. Debt is down over $400 million this year, and we have reduced debt comparable EBITDA margin 0.7 points to [inaudible] times. ", "With that, we're happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", " (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Timothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Timothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "", "You mentioned hedging losses. Was that currency hedges or what exactly was that and the order of magnitude, please?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, it was mostly transactional currency hedges, Tim, and the total for the quarter was probably around $8\u00a0million. So we had some ineffectiveness and some other things going on in the hedging portfolio, so we look at that as a onequarter aberration.", "Timothy Ramey - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "And I think your sales guidance implies an acceleration of kind of organic performance in line for the second half, if I'm not mistaken. I mean, seasonal is with us every year. What gives you that confidence that we'll see that?", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes, your deduction is exactly right. There's a lot of things going on in the portfolio. Probably the most important thing is that, you know, we've taken a lot of pricing. Typically you see the effect pricing on volume occurring to a greater degree the closer to the actual pricing action we've taken and to a lesser degree as you start going out. So as we get farther away from the point in time when we've taken the pricing increase, then the market has adjusted to the pricing and competitors have reacted. We are expecting stronger sales growth in the second half. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Reza Vahabzadeh - Lehman Brothers.", "Reza Vahabzadeh - Lehman Brothers", "", "You talked about the grape cost increase in the U.S. and then also about the packaging cost increase as well for the Wine business. It wasn't clear to me what the total cost inflation is that you expect for next year and the price increase that you need to offset that for the Wine business and then the same thing, if it's possible, for the Beer business. ", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes. What we said was that we are experiencing about mid single digit COGS increases and that we are more than offsetting that with price increases. Our price increases have been in the mid single digit range, so mid single digit price increase has more than offset mid single digit COGS increases. [inaudible] percentage on a smaller base versus a larger base.", "Then in Beer we have contractual cost increases from the supplier Modelo, and those contractual cost increases are very small, less than inflationary rates. And we're really not subject to a lot of other COGS or input cost pressures in the Beer business. We're pretty insulated from that due to the nature of the business.", "Reza Vahabzadeh - Lehman Brothers", "Would those cost and pricing dynamics, the COGS inflation and pricing dynamics for your Wine and Beer business in the U.S., would those relationships generally hold going forward, though? ", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes. The relationship holds about 40%, 50% in the Wine business of our COGS of grapes. The rest is packaging and other components. And, as I said, we're seeing about mid single digit inflation and input costs across the board and pricing has been in the mid single digit range. So we see that kind of thing holding.", "Reza Vahabzadeh - Lehman Brothers", "And then Bob, obviously the company's deleveraged over the last 12 months to organic cash flow and also asset sales and you talk about more deleveraging going forward, but to the extent that there are attractive wine portfolios for sale in the next six months, how does the company gauge and characterize its interests in terms of acquisitions in U.S. wine assets?", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes, you know, what our position on that is that our main focus at the current time is improving efficiencies, improving ROIC, paying down debt, deleveraging. What we've said is that we're not going to categorically say that we won't ever do an acquisition or we won't look at acquisitions, but the focus has been on driving efficiencies and generating free cash flow, and I think that you can see some pretty good results in our rapid deleveraging and ROIC improvement, so that's pretty much where we're at there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS.", "Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS", "", "Rob, so much of your commentary was around pricing. Could you, given what's going on with the economy, can you talk about if you're seeing any down trading and then also if strategically there's something that you might be doing differently given the economic situation that we're in. And then hopefully some insights by region instead of just an overall view. ", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes. I mean, the basic answer to your question is there really is almost no evidence of down trading. If you look at IRI data sort of segment by segment in the Wine business, you'd see the exact same pattern that we've seen in the past, which is value products are either flat, declining and then, as you start moving up the price tier, growth is occurring at faster and faster rates, largely.", "In Spirits, I think you're seeing some moderation in the premium segment, with the premium segment coming more in line with the value segment and the value segment increasing a little bit. So you might say that there's some trading down going on in Spirits even though, as a general proposition, there isn't trading down.", "In Beer, there isn't really trading down either. There's some shifting around. The imports have been weak, but that's driven largely by our portfolio being the largest in the import category and the factors that have affected our portfolio. Excluding our portfolio, imports are pretty strong. And [crafts] are very strong and, in the domestic front, the premiums and more premium are pretty strong.", "So we really haven't seen too much trading down as a general proposition. Now, you know, you can look at specific brands and you can see what could be trading down. Our SVEDKA Vodka, for instance, which continues to grow at huge rates, you know, 40%, 50% growth in SVEDKA on a very large base, it could be the beneficiary - it's the beneficiary of, I think, both trading up and trading down. You've got people that are trading up from, say, the domestic vodkas that are slightly below it, and then you might have people trading down from some of the very high-priced vodkas, which definitely have seen some slowdown.", "But, as I said, as a general proposition, trading up continues to be a pretty strong trend across all beverage alcohol categories.", "You asked me about regionally, I don't think that we're really seeing any huge regional differences that are worth noting. As it relates to our Beer portfolio, there are some states in the U.S. that have been particularly hard hit by the economic downturn, especially as it's impacted housing. I mentioned California, Florida and Arizona in that regard, some of the border states - Arizona and California, that is. So that's pretty much I'd say a good summary of the state of the industry as it relates to your question about trading down versus trading up.", "Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS", "And then just any contingency plans or anything you might be doing differently? It sounds like you feel fine about the category, that there's nothing strategically you're changing given the economy, correct?", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes. No, we're not. The beverage alcohol business, the growth remains pretty healthy in our industry. I would say that if you look at the growth rates across most of the categories, beer is actually growing very well at the current time. Wine, I think we've seen some moderation in growth overall, but I would say it's actually moderated to the more historical growth levels as opposed to the very high levels that you were seeing maybe eight, nine months ago. And, you know, Spirits growth is pretty healthy for Spirits, in mid single range.", "So it's a pretty healthy industry in general and pretty non-cyclical, so it doesn't really call for any strategic shifts to deal with the economic conditions as might be the case in other industries that are more clearly or directly impacted by what's going on.", "Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS", "And then quickly for Bob, any contingency plans for the debt coming due in 2009? And given the credit environment, are there any issues with suppliers, grape suppliers, or anything that we need to be thinking about? ", "Robert P. Ryder", "Well, we're really not worried at all about any of our debt maturities. We have about $210 million coming due this year on Term A, I think 90, it happened, year-to-date. And yes, the sterling notes come up next year and really our discussion is do we put in more sterling notes or do it in U.S. is more the concern. I mean, you know, right now we've got zero drawn against the $900 million revolver, so we feel very comfortable with our liquidity position.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Lauren Torres - HSBC.", "Lauren Torres - HSBC", "", "Just first a housekeeping item. Bob, can you just go back and give us the reason why the tax rate was so low in the quarter?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes. I mean, essentially, Lauren, it was just a fallout of a tax position that we had taken that has become more clarified. So, you know, under the new FIN 48 rules, you sort of have to sort out your tax rate on a quarterly basis. So we don't see an impact to the total full year tax rate, more just a timing thing.", "Lauren Torres - HSBC", "So for your tax rate, your comparable tax rate, to still be around 37% for the year, we expect more than that in the second half?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, because year-to-date you're less than that, correct.", "Lauren Torres - HSBC", "And also I'm not sure if you mentioned this, Rob, when talking about Corona imports, but as you expected better second half performance and you expect your competitors to pass through some pricing, can you talk about, if you can, what your pricing strategy is for the remainder of the year?", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes. Our pricing strategy is not to take any pricing. We took our pricing last year. We have no plans to take any pricing this year. So, you know, this is going to be, I think, a pretty favorable - this is going to be pretty favorable relative to growth of the portfolio in the second half of the year. Domestics are taking pricing now. In anticipation of that pricing, there's probably been some buy-in at the retail level. That will dissipate. Price gaps are closing. And, you know, look, I mean, I said what I said about anticipated growth for the year, which we're now saying it's flattish to slightly up, but I would say that the second half of the year we're pretty optimistic about the portfolio. ", "And we're already seeing some signs of growth returning to the portfolio but, given the performance in the first half of the year, you know, the math doesn't get us to the previous guidance of mid single digit growth. It's as simple as that. But the portfolio is healthy and we're seeing growth return and we're pretty optimistic, and I think that the headwinds are diminishing significantly. ", "Lauren Torres - HSBC", "So looking at the costs that you're facing this year in the Beer segment, you're comfortable with not taking that pricing?", "Robert S. Sands", "Cost? Yes, we don't have much cost increases; very, very little, as I think Bob pointed out in his talk and as we pointed out to you all before. The only real cost increase we have is contractually dictated cost increases from the brewery, and those are very small cost increases. It's below U.S. inflationary rates. So we don't suffer from the same kind of thing that manufacturers suffer from in the Beer business. When I say we, I mean the Crown joint venture. ", "Robert P. Ryder", "If you look at the Crown operating margin versus a year ago, it's down a bit, and 60% of that is timing due to just how the marketing flows through the P&L.", "Lauren Torres - HSBC", "And if I can ask just one more question on your Wine business - I think you mentioned this, Bob, too - if you exclude the inventory reduction a year ago, your North America branded wine sales would have been up what? Did you say low single digits?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Unidentified Analyst - J.P. Morgan.", "Unidentified Analyst - J.P. Morgan", "", "Just to clarify, you beat down $400 million of debt this quarter. Could you break it out between [results] in terms of [inaudible] was? ", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes. Most of it came out of the revolver. The only other piece is the Term A loan. We paid off $90 million. The rest came out of the revolver. And as I said, I think, you know, as of right now, we really have nothing drawn down against the revolver.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "", "Rob, I was wondering if you could give us a kind of state of the union on the restructuring exercise, if I can simplify it that much. You've been engaging in restructuring for several years now and, with the exception of Crown, it's kind of covered, I guess, to an extent - with the exception of Spirits - it's kind of covered all your businesses. What inning do you think you're in in this whole restructuring process of the company now that you're more focused on internal performance versus acquisitions? And then, if you're not in the seventh or eighth inning, where do you think there remains significant opportunity and what sort of magnitude are you seeing?", "Robert S. Sands", "Well, Mark, as you pointed out, we've done a lot in this regard, and it's touched a lot of different parts of the business. Yes, I'd say, you know, seventh, eighth inning is probably as good a characterization as any. Clearly we're way beyond any beginning stages of restructuring activity. And it's not to say that there isn't opportunities as we go forward, but we've been knocking off the opportunities fairly rapidly. I would say that over time we'd really like to get away from having to do restructuring. That's why we've been pretty aggressive in getting as much done as we can upfront.", "But, you know, we look at restructuring as an investment. We analyze it in terms of return on - we analyze restructurings in terms of return on investment, and we're also pretty conservative in that regard in that our restructuring, we demand very high returns on restructuring activities. So to the extent that we would have more restructuring activities in the future - which I'm not really commenting on other than I did say that I would agree with your characterization of seventh, eighth inning - but to the extent that we have them in the future is going to be a positive thing, not a negative thing, in that our restructurings are high-return investments.", "So that's, I guess, the state of the union that I would give you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bill Leach - JWL Capital.", "Bill Leach - JWL Capital", "", "I just wanted to follow up on this tax rate question. [To reach 37%] for the year, pretty much the tax it would be around 41% in the second half. Why would it be so high? ", "Robert P. Ryder", "Again, it's all around timing, okay? So the second quarter is sort of abnormally low, and the things that are reversed aren't necessarily for this year; some are for prior years, some are for future years. So it's very difficult to deal with quarterly tax rates so I would say for your models and everything just assume a 37% for the full year. ", "Bill Leach - JWL Capital", "So my [inaudible] correct, I expect over 40% in the second half?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes. You can't really look at it on a quarterly basis. I know you're supposed to but tax rates aren't specific for the quarter. There's a lot of things that hit a quarter that actually belong in other quarters. So I would do whatever you have to with the math, which might make us around 41, to keep your full year at 37.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.", "", "I'm just trying to understand better the possibility of [inaudible] U.S. Wine business. I know a large part of that is really driven by [inaudible] impact as you've been sparring and changing your portfolio, but beyond that, if you can talk about how some of the efficiencies that you've indicated before, [inaudible] margin, other than mix, if you look at sort of your - or other than acquisition, if you look at your underlying Wine, are you seeing [inaudible] improvement there and what's the [inaudible]?", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes. You kind of cut in and out a little bit, but I think your basic question was about mix shift and how is that impacting efficiencies and what's going on beyond the acquisition front. ", "In general, we've got a pretty significant mix shift occurring. It's occurring both organically as well as through acquisitions and dispositions, you know, the Clos du Bois acquisition and the Almaden, Inglenook disposition. But going back to the point about premium products growing at a faster rate than value prices, this is also driving mix shift in the business.", "We've been able to take advantage of that and drive efficiencies in our production organization as we've move out brands, as I said, like Almaden or Inglenook, or we have discontinued brands through our SKU reduction initiative. We're making room in our premium portfolio without having to add extra PP&E. That's really the key there. That's what's driving the efficiency. Therefore we're getting a higher and better use out of our assets all the time as the mix shift occurs, both organically and through acquisitions and dispositions.", "So this is a trend that we're taking advantage of and do something that's driving efficiencies in the business both organically as well as not organically, as I've stated. ", "Robert P. Ryder", "Just to add on with what Rob said, it's a combination of things. If you just take - this is all sort of delivered\u00a0 if you just take the Clos du Bois, Inglenook transactions, okay, we bought Clos du Bois in the portfolio, which of course, has a much higher margin than Almaden and Inglenook, the combination of those two things improved our gross margin in the U.S. Wine business by 250 to 300 basis points. And remember, you know, net-net we've almost paid off all that incremental debt, okay, because we paid like $880 for Clos du Bois. We brought in about $130 for Almaden and Inglenook. We're generating cash flow and we've paid off $420 million of debt year-to-date.", "So we're sort of left with a faster growing, more profitable portfolio, and with those higher gross margins, we're able to leverage our SG&A infrastructure better as well. That sort of what we're trying to do.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.", "Okay, and then just quickly, I know - can you give us your ballpark, just [inaudible] the numbers, for U.S. wine and Crown Imports?", "Robert S. Sands", "Ballpark numbers for what?", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.", "Ballpark depletion - depletion trends.", "Robert S. Sands", "Well, we're sticking to the guidance that we've given.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.", "For the third quarter, Rob, third quarter.", "Robert S. Sands", "Third quarter?", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.", "Yes. ", "Robert S. Sands", "We don't give - well, obviously we don\u2019t give quarterly guidance in any event, but we're looking for mid single-digit growth in Wine, and Beer, we're looking at flattish to slightly up. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.", "I'm sorry. In the second quarter, was the depletion trend - how does that trend in the second quarter, sorry, for the Wine and the Beer business?", "Robert S. Sands", "Beer was a little bit on the downside. And, you know, Wine sales have been lower than we expected primarily due to, as we said, the price increases. So, you know, slightly down.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch.", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "", "Just a quick one on inventory levels or working capital issues at your distributors. Are you seeing anything going on there with respect to the credit crisis and just a greater desire to manage working capital? Is that hurting shipmenttodepletion ratios?", "Robert P. Ryder", "No. There's a constant to and fro between us and the distributors on inventory level, but we took our distributor inventory down last year and we're really not seeing anything out of the ordinary. Now maybe our competitors, many of whom have higher inventory balances, are seeing that, but we really are not.", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "We're hearing basically high-end products, so those where the cost of carry might be higher. So I know you've taken your inventory levels down. I'm just wondering if perhaps some of your higher-end Spirits are facing some of those issues.", "Robert P. Ryder", "No, we're not seeing that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities.", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "", "I guess a follow up on Judy's question on the profitability of the U.S. Wine business. First question, the $8\u00a0million hedging loss that you recorded, what segment did you record that in?", "Robert P. Ryder", "It was mostly in the Wine division.", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "Mostly in the Wine business.", "Robert P. Ryder", "I'm sorry, I didn't catch the last [inaudible], Bryan.", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "All right, so you recorded - the $8 million loss was recorded in the hedge - in the Wine business? ", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, most of that is in the Wine segment.", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "And that's $8 million pre-tax?", "Robert P. Ryder", "That's pre-tax, yes. It's $6 to $8 million, in that range.", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. And then in terms of going forward are there other hedges? Do we have to think about other hedges as we're modeling out margins for the back half of the year?", "Robert P. Ryder", "No, we think that will be much reduced in future quarters.", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "And then, so as we're looking at the - because when you look at the margin in the back half of the year, as you've now pretty much lapped the impact from the inventory de-stocking last year, I guess the question's going to be what's your confidence in your ability to grow margin off of sort of a higher margin base? And, if I'm thinking about this right, your margin performance in the second quarter would have been better had you not have recorded the hedge loss, but are there any other factors we should think about in terms of margins in the back half of the year that would sort of give confidence to be able to grow margins off a higher base?", "Robert P. Ryder", "I mean, it's sort of the back half of the year. I would agree with you. I would expect our margins to get a little bit better in the back half of the year. I think there was some timing stuff in the SG&A for this quarter that we expect to [inaudible] balance of the year. And I do think that distributor inventory reduction is behind us, so that actually helped our margin versus prior year this year. But you sort of have enough of those numbers. ", "So I would expect the balance of the year margins to get a little bit better.", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. And then just one follow up. In terms of the price increases that you put through on your Wine business generally, has all of that pricing now been put through or are there going to be more price increases between now and the end of the year?", "Robert P. Ryder", "I think that we're always looking at pricing and its impact on volumes, so I don't know if we've made those decisions. I'd say the majority of them are behind us, but we may be looking at some incremental ones. Probably it won't be an overall increase like we've had. It might be on specific brands.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no further questions and this does conclude today's Q&A session. ", "Robert S. Sands", "Okay, well, thank you all for joining us for our call today. And I apologize for our little fire alarm here, but I think that we were able to hear the questions and I think that you were able to hear us. ", "In general, I'm very pleased with our continued execution towards meeting our financial and operational goals for the year, especially given the tough macro environment we're facing. During the quarter I'd point out we generated strong free cash flow and rapidly deleveraged. We improved our comparable gross profit and operating margins, and we enhanced the profitability of our U.S. line of spirits. Our plan clearly is to continue this strong execution throughout the remainder of the year.

My name is Brandy and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Constellation Brands first quarter 2010 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. ", "Patty Yahn-Urlaub", "Thank you, Brandy. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Constellation\u2019s first quarter 2010 conference call. I am here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer. ", "By now you should have an opportunity to read our new release which has also been furnished to the SEC. This conference call is intended to complement the release. ", "During the call, we will discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable organic and constant currency basis. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company\u2019s website at www.cbrands.com under the investors section. ", "These reconciliations include explanations as to why management uses the non-GAAP financial measures and why management believes they are useful to investors. ", "Discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results excluding [inaudible] costs, restructuring and related charges and unusual items. ", "We will also discuss organic net sales information which is defined in the news release and constant currency net sales information, which exclude the impact of year over year currency exchange rate fluctuations. ", "Please be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. Although statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company\u2019s estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation\u2019s SEC filings. ", "And now I would like to turn the call over to Rob. ", "Robert S. Sands", "Well, thanks, Patty and good morning, everybody and welcome to our discussion of Constellation\u2019s first quarter sales and earnings results. We are generally pleased with our quarterly results, which were in line with our expectations and demonstrate that we are on track to achieve our goals for fiscal 2010. Despite the ongoing challenges of a difficult operating environment worldwide, we continued to reduce our debt and improve our operating margins. ", "We completed the sale of our value spirits business, which is consistent with our strategic focus on premium high growth, higher margin brands and utilized the transaction proceeds to reduce debt. ", "In addition, we began to reap the benefits of our cost reduction initiative, which was implemented with the goal of mitigating the negative impacts from the turbulent global economy and creating efficiencies that will drive performance benefits over the long-term. ", "This cost focus helped us to offset the unfavorable product mix created by ongoing shifts in consumer buying patterns. However, a continuation of our planned SKU reduction activities worldwide has tempered our top-line growth. ", "Our focus on driving operational efficiencies, as well as portfolio pruning through divestitures and SKU reductions, is absolutely the right strategy to pursue as one of our top priorities is to manage for improved profitability in this challenging environment. This helps to ensure the long-term health of our business. ", "And now I\u2019d like to discuss the operational aspects of the quarter, beginning with the North American wine business. ", "During the quarter, we completed the integration of our remaining spirits business into our North American wine organization and [begin resigning] the structure of our U.S. wine business into a single, integrated organization, especially in the areas of sales and marketing. These actions will simplify our organizational structure, provide synergy benefits, and are intended to improve efficiency and effectiveness with our trade partners. ", "We are also progressing with our efforts to consolidate our U.S. distributor network in key markets and implement a new go-to-market strategy. This has been made possible through the dramatic transformation of our portfolio which has occurred throughout the last 18 months and has resulted in a much more focused set of premium, consumer preferred brands that also have a desirable margin profile for distributors. ", "We are currently in the process of negotiating with our distributors. The initial transition will encompass up to 17 states representing approximately 50% of our total U.S. volume for wine and spirits. The goal of our new U.S. organizational structure and distributor consolidation initiative is to gain better alignment of dedicated selling resources working on a focused set of priorities and processes aimed at driving execution and accountability. We will implement an enhanced distributor incentive structure with the objective of driving organic growth. ", "We expect to begin transitioning by the end of this summer and will provide additional details when we are ready to officially launch the program. This new level of increased importance to our key distributor partners is designed to position us for future growth in a consolidating market. ", "From a marketplace perspective, growth in the U.S. wine market remains healthy at about 5% on a dollar basis, according to recent 12-week IRI data. The premium plus segment of the market where wine sales for greater than $5 a bottle at retail continues to grow in line with the total category. And as you know, we have a strong portfolio of U.S. wine brands throughout all price segments and we continue to see consumers turning to trusted brands that represent quality for good value. ", "Many of our well-known premium wine brands performed well in the marketplace during the quarter, including Woodbridge and Rex Goliath, Blackstone, [inaudible], Clos du Bois, [Simi], Wild Horse, and Kim Crawford, just to name a few. ", "SVEDKA Vodka posted another great quarter and generated sales growth of more than 30% versus last year. According to market data, it has become the fifth largest vodka brand overall in the U.S. and now ranks as the third-largest import. Black Velvet also posted solid sales results for the quarter. ", "Our Canadian wine business posted positive results for the quarter, primarily driven by the premium wine portfolio, including Jackson Trigg, Sawmill Creek, and Naked Grape, which all contributed to solid sales growth. ", "Recently, Canada\u2019s Le Clos Jordanne chardonnay captured the top spot for chardonnay in the judgment of Montreal expert\u2019s blind tasting, surpassing wines from France and other parts of the world. ", "And now moving to our international business, as you know, Australia and the U.K. continue to be challenged by a myriad of issues that have negatively impacted our business in these locations. These challenges do not relate to Constellation alone but to all suppliers who do business in these geographies. ", "We often discuss these markets in the same vein and we ship approximately 70% of our Australian exports to the U.K. marketplace. Although the U.K. and Australia combined represent a small percent of our total profits, our goal is to minimize operational variability for these businesses and our overall results going forward. ", "Therefore we are now running the U.K. and Australia business with a focus on cash. We will continue to take out costs, decrease our networking capital investment, and increase efficiencies by consolidating as much production as possible. Our goal is to generate cash, improve gross profit, and variabilize the business model. ", "As you know, we recently announced changes in our international management structure aimed at better aligning our businesses in the U.K. and Australia to provide opportunities for cost savings and increased efficiencies. We are working on developing the appropriate long-term strategy for these businesses and will move rapidly to implement these plans once finalized. ", "In the U.K., positive year-over-year sales trends in the first quarter were primarily the result of a year-over-year pre-buy and timing related to the duty increase. The 2009 grape harvest in Australia is now complete. Although final data is not yet available, it appears that the current harvest estimate is approximately 1.7 million tons, versus a harvest of about 1.8 million tons last year. However, overall supply continues to outstrip demand. ", "The cost of Australian grapes has decreased significantly for the calendar 2009 harvest due to the fact that last year many growers paid for water supply during the growing season due to the drought conditions in the region at the time. ", "Moving to the Crown imports joint venture, Crown experienced positive momentum during the Cinco de Mayo holiday driving year-over-year improvement in case sales through excellent execution at retail. However, this positive momentum was offset by the economic driven trends, particularly in the on-premise and convenience channels and an overall mix shift away from imports. ", "In addition, competitive price discounting has become prevalent in the form of mail-in rebates offered at retail as Crown enters the busy summer selling season. More recently, however, Crown is beginning to see some improving trends in the grocery channel from national chain stores as a result of targeted marketing efforts and programming against those key channels. ", "These efforts include the reprisal of Corona Extra\u2019s iconic television ads from the 1990s following considerable analysis and consumer research. This is a very cost-effective approach to media investment. ", "Overall, Crown is focusing on optimizing promotional activity and media support into and through the peak seasonal periods when consumers buy the most. ", "Crown is also seeing some success with a number of new SKU and packaging introductions, expanding distribution to additional states with Modello Especiale, Corona, and Corona Light 18-packs, Corona Light 12-pack cans, and Modello Especiale 24-packs. And the next phase rollout for Modello Draft will begin in late July. ", "Modello Especiale continues to be one of the few major super premium brands that is experiencing double-digit market growth. ", "Now in closing, we\u2019ve been impacted by the global slow-down but are taking the necessary actions to fortify the company short-term. The culmination of everything we are doing positions us well to drive sales growth, margin expansion, and improved ROIC once we clear the headwinds from this challenging external environment. Overall, our business strategy remains intact. We are executing and taking the appropriate actions designed to further position our business for success in the future. ", "And now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bob Ryder for a financial discussion of our business results. ", "Robert P. Ryder", "Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Given the continuing difficult global economic and market conditions, I am generally pleased with our results, which were in line with our expectations. Our comparable basic diluted EPS for the quarter came in at $0.33 a share versus $0.34 last year. ", "The quarter saw quite a bit of change due to foreign exchange rates. The dollar strengthened dramatically versus our key currencies when compared to the prior year. In dollar terms, this reduced our international sales and SG&A expenses. ", "The state of the global economy also impacted our sales mix as consumers across the beverage alcohol category gravitated towards lower priced products. For us, this generally means a lower gross profit margin. ", "The profit margin for our international business also continues to disappointing. We began to see the sales mix trend at the end of last year and we took some dramatic offsetting actions. We sold our value spirits and other businesses and eliminated the associated standalone SG&A. We began our global cost reduction initiative, tightened down on marketing and general expense, and continued to focus on debt pay-downs and interest expense reduction. ", "These tactics were generally successful in Q1 as our SG&A and interest savings offset gross profit reductions resulting in slightly higher pre-tax income versus the prior year. ", "We also continued to pay down debt and are well on our way to achieving a comparable basis debt-to-EBITDA ratio by the end of fiscal 2010 in the high three times range. ", "Now let\u2019s look at our Q1 P&L performance, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. First, the net sales line -- as you can see from our news release on page 13, our consolidated reported net sales decreased 15%, primarily due to the impact of year-over-year currency exchange rate fluctuations and the divestiture of our value spirits business, spirits contract production services, and certain Pacific Northwest wine brands. ", "On an organic constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and for-ex rate changes, net sales increased 1%. ", "My commentary for the following net sales comparisons will be on a constant currency basis. Our worldwide branded wide organic net sales increased 1%. Organic branded wine net sales for North America, which appears on page 12 of the release, decreased 1% while Europe and Australia/New Zealand increased 6% and 7% respectively. ", "Our global branded wine business continues to be impacted by ongoing SKU reductions in a challenging economic environment which is driving unfavorable sales mix. However, the SG&A reduction efforts are having the expected benefit of offsetting much of the reduced gross profit margins from the negative mix. ", "We estimate that SKU reduction actions negatively impacted North American sales growth by approximately 2 percentage points. ", "Sales for Europe benefited from year-over-year timing related to customer buying prior to the U.K. duty increases. ", "Australia and New Zealand saw some improvement, albeit on a small base, driven by sales in the Asia-Pacific region. ", "Spirits organic net sales increased 13%, led by 33% growth from SVEDKA Vodka. ", "Now let\u2019s look at our profits on a comparable basis, using information on page 14 of the release. For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 34.9%, down 1.5 percentage points. This reflects the unfavorable sales mix that I discussed earlier, partially offset by the sale of the lower margin value spirits business. ", "Our consolidated SG&A for the quarter was 19.3% of net sales compared to 22.3% a year ago. The 3 percentage point decrease was primarily driven by previously mentioned cost reduction actions, lower advertising and marketing expense, and gains on foreign currency hedges. ", "Consolidated operating income decreased 6% to $123 million but our operating margins increased 1.5 percentage points to 15.6%. ", "I would now like to turn to our segment operating income results on page 11 of the release to provide highlights of these changes. ", "With the sale of the value spirits business and the integration of the remaining spirits business into our North American wine organization, our segment reporting has changed accordingly and the spirits business is now included in the wine segment. Prior periods have been classified in our press release and our segment history schedule on our website reflects this change. ", "Wine segment operating income decreased $8 million to $148 million. The decrease is primarily due to the divestiture of the value spirits business and certain Pacific Northwest brands, negative mix, and a decrease in international profitability, partially offset by our SG&A reduction initiatives and foreign currency gains. ", "For the quarter, corporate and other expenses totaled $24 million, which was level with the prior year. Higher stock compensation was offset by cost savings. ", "On page 14, you can see consolidated equity investment earnings totaled $63 million versus $72 million last year. Equity earnings for Crown totaled $63 million versus $70 million. For the first quarter, Crown generated net sales of $636 million, a decrease of 5%, and operating income of $126 million, a decrease of 9%. ", "Similar to the wine category, we have seen consumers gravitate towards lower priced beers. Sales were impacted by soft performance in the convenience and on-premise channels which have seen a more dramatic impact from the economy. In addition to the sales decrease, operating income was primarily impacted by a contractual cost increase and negative sales mix. ", "Interest expense for the quarter was $67 million, down 23% versus last year. This decrease was driven by our significant debt reduction over the past 15 months and a decrease in our average interest rate for the quarter, versus the prior year as LIBOR decreased for our variable rate debt.", "Now let\u2019s take a look at our debt position -- at the end of May, our debt totaled $4.3 billion, which represented $112 million decrease from our debt level at the end of fiscal 2009. The decrease reflects proceeds received from the sale of the value spirits business partially offset by the use of free cash flow in the quarter. I\u2019ll talk about free cash flow in a few moments. ", "Our average interest rate for the quarter was down to about 6%. ", "Our debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio at the end of May was 4.3 times, consistent with the ratio at the end of fiscal \u201909. The benefit of the debt reduction was essentially offset by lower EBITDA, reflecting our softest financial performance over the last two quarters. ", "Our comparable basis tax rate came in at 39% compared to 37% last year. We are still targeting a full-year tax rate of 38%. ", "Due to the many factors just mentioned, diluted EPS was $0.33 versus $0.34 last year. ", "Now let\u2019s turn to cash flow on page 10 of the news release. For purposes of this discussion, free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. ", "Due to seasonal factors, we\u2019re normally a first quarter user of cash and for the first quarter of 2010, we used free cash flow of $102 million versus a use in the prior year of about $55 million. ", "The higher use of cash was due in part to higher CapEx spending for the quarter due to timing. In the working capital area, inventory benefited from lower grape harvest in Australia and New Zealand versus the prior year. ", "The majority of the higher cost fiscal year 2009 harvest is rolling through cost of goods sold in this fiscal year, contributing to our reduced international profits. ", "Receivables were higher due to the timing of sales in the quarter. For fiscal 2010, we are still targeting free cash flow to be in the range of $230 million to $270 million. This includes CapEx in the range of $150 million to $170 million. As a reminder, free cash flow for 2010 was expected to be negatively impacted by higher taxes paid primarily due to the $65 million tax payment related to the sale of the value spirits business, which we expect to make in Q2. ", "We expect to continue to utilize free cash flow to reduce borrowings. ", "Moving to our P&L outlook for full year 2010, as reflected in the outlook section of the press release, we continue to forecast comparable basis diluted EPS in the range of $1.60 to $1.70 a share. Interest expense is expected to be in the range of $265 million to $285 million and we\u2019re assuming weighted average diluted shares to be about 222 million. ", "Our comparable basis guidance excludes acquisition related integration costs, restructuring charges, and unusual items which are detailed on page 16 of the news release. ", "During Q1, we recorded approximately $0.12 in charges for restructuring and related activity, including our global cost reduction initiative announced in April. We also recorded a $0.17 charge associated with the sale of the value spirits business. ", "Before we take your questions, I would like to note that in these uncertain times, with difficult economic and market conditions, we remain focused on margins and ROIC, reducing debt and keep leverage at manageable levels. I believe the strength of our portfolio, combined with our SG&A reduction efforts, positions us well to work through the current environment and take advantage of opportunities when conditions improve. ", "With that, we\u2019ll open up the line for questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with UBS.", "Analyst for Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Warburg", "Good morning. This is [Seth] standing in for Kaumil. [Regarding the distributor] transition that you mentioned would be taking place this summer, should we be concerned about any disruption in 2Q or 3Q because of that?", "Robert S. Sands", "You know, we don\u2019t expect any disruption at this time as a consequence of our distributor activities. You know, we\u2019ve put a lot of things in place to ensure that things remain intact during the transition period so right now, we feel pretty good about that. ", "Analyst for Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Warburg", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Ramey with D.A. Davidson.", "Timothy Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Good morning. Congratulations, guys. As you get into the latter half of the year, have you -- I know you don\u2019t give quarterly guidance but have you given thoughts to how the currency impacts shake out and what that might mean for you, particularly with regard to your new strategy in Australia and the U.K.?", "Robert P. Ryder", "You know, we do look at that stuff but if we were real good on anticipating for-ex rates, we\u2019d be working down on Wall Street but what we try to do with all our -- with our hedged activities is we try to offset the volatility, so for instance in this quarter, we actually saw some positive impact from our hedges, whereas in last year\u2019s first quarter, we saw some negative impact from hedges specifically. Now, there are offsetting things helping the other line items. But we don\u2019t -- it\u2019s not really a big number. We expect for-ex volatility to be maybe a positive/negative of about $0.01 in any quarter. ", "Timothy Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay, and then just on some of the mid-tier brands, you know, can you kind of more fully flesh out a little bit on what you are seeing in terms of trade down and -- I mean, you described a couple of the results as solid but I\u2019d rather have numbers than letters. ", "Robert S. Sands", "In terms of our mid-tier brands, we are seeing some positive results. We see brands like Woodbridge continuing to grow in the high-single-digit range. We see brands like Clos du Bois, for instance, we\u2019re seeing about 8% volume growth on that particular brand. So you know, there\u2019s ups and downs in the portfolio and we do see a trend towards what we would describe as better known and trusted brands that represent good value for money. I think that some of our brands are benefiting from that in general. ", "We do see volume basis trading up continuing in the industry with total wine in the lower single digit range. Premium plus and super premium in the mid and moving up into the higher single digit range on a volume basis. ", "On a dollar basis, interestingly enough, in the value business we continue to see a lot of pricing being taken in the marketplace, so while we see value wines growing at a lower percentage on a volume basis than premium and super premium plus wines, on a dollar basis they are actually growing faster because I think the major players in that industry, in that segment, of which we are not one, are taking the opportunity to take pricing in the value segments. ", "Timothy Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Thanks. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Carla Casella with JP Morgan.", "Carla Casella - JP Morgan", "Hi. One clarification question -- you mentioned the gain on FX hedges that was in SG&A. Did you give the amount that was in this year and last year?", "Robert P. Ryder", "No, but I\u2019d say you can figure it out -- it was about a penny positive this year and about a penny negative last year, so the -- so again, in any quarter it\u2019s about a penny but this quarter when you look year over year, the delta is a positive to a negative so it sort of makes it look bigger than it is. ", "Carla Casella - JP Morgan", "Okay, and then in the other segment of sales, I guess it\u2019s wholesale and other, it looks like some of the businesses you sold might have been included in that. Can you just say -- the run-rate is about $43 million this quarter. Is that a good run-rate to use or was that seasonally low or somewhat otherwise affected?", "Robert P. Ryder", "I think the biggest product in that category is our cider business in the U.K. and the cider business in the U.K. is very much a summer product, so you might see like a higher number in say the second quarter. You also have a lot of translation going on because most of those sales are overseas. ", "Carla Casella - JP Morgan", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then one question on gross margin -- can you clarify anymore how much of the gross margin change was affected by mix versus any promotional activity versus packaging or other cost increases?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Well, we sort of look at it all as one big bucket but obviously as we said, negative mix shift had a pretty big impact on us in the quarter because -- and this is a general statement -- as you move down the price ladder, the gross profit margin tends to be less. ", "The thing we are really happy about is we sort of saw this coming and we took some pretty dramatic cost-out actions and those cost-out actions are offsetting most of the negative mix shift up in gross profit. You can see the SG&A coming down. ", "Carla Casella - JP Morgan", "Okay, so it sounds like it\u2019s more mix than any promotional activity?", "Robert P. Ryder", "It\u2019s more mix than promotional activities, yes. ", "Carla Casella - JP Morgan", "Okay, and then just one last question -- June weather we know has been pretty bad and a lot of retailers have been hit. Have you seen -- has that affected any certain segments of your business that are dependent on outdoor summer activities, et cetera?", "Robert S. Sands", "I think it\u2019s a little early to tell how June weather will affect the business. Obviously the beer business is heavily skewed towards the summer selling season. This is the big time and we are going to have to see how -- we are going to have to see how the -- you know, our brands in particular fair over the summer selling season. We\u2019ve got a lot in place relative to that. ", "You know, other than beer, obviously, in the U.S. and Canada in particular -- actually, worldwide wine sales don\u2019t tend to be affected by weather. It\u2019s not a weather related -- ", "Robert P. Ryder", "It\u2019s not a thirst-quencher. ", "Robert S. Sands", "-- beverage. Right. ", "Carla Casella - JP Morgan", "Right. Okay. ", "Robert S. Sands", "So it\u2019s really the beer business and it\u2019s too early to tell how we\u2019re going to do during the summer selling season. ", "Carla Casella - JP Morgan", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Christine Farkas with Bank of America.", "Christine Farkas - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Thank you very much. Good morning, Rob and Bob. I think, Bob, you might have answered this a little bit but I want to get a little more color on your North American or the overall wine margin, I should say. In the fourth quarter we saw margin contraction of about 180 basis points on the operating profit line. It sounds to me that cost controls are coming in maybe even stronger. Can you tell us if your margin contraction was better or worse than what we saw in wine in the fourth quarter?", "Robert P. Ryder", "The fourth quarter generally had some anomalies that caused the margins to be lower year over year but I\u2019d say in Q1, we saw slightly better margins than in Q4 so it\u2019s getting a little bit better and I think you got the point, Christine, of the cost-savings initiatives that we began at the end of last year are really starting to kick in in Q1. You know, in Q1 we had to take out quite a few Constellation associates and that will continue through the balance of year and we are also taking some facility actions and we are being really cautious on our marketing spend. On spending that we can hold back on, we are holding back on.  ", "Christine Farkas - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Can you quantify -- sorry, I was going to ask if you can quantify what your targets were for SG&A or I should say overall cost reductions and how much you have achieved so far?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Sure. So what we said, and this is just for the global cost initiative that we announced I think in the fourth quarter call last year, we will be taking out savings this year, $25 million, full-year run-rate is $50 million because we will only have about a half-year of savings this year, so again you will see our savings as we go through the year pick up. I mean, again unfortunately just last week we announced 100 people would be leaving the U.S. wine business and that will be happening in Q2 and forward quarters, so it continues to -- ", "Christine Farkas - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "And these are all part of your already announced global initiative program as we see these headlines?", "Robert P. Ryder", "That is correct. ", "Christine Farkas - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Okay, and a final question, if I could, on your international wine business -- certainly your comments are clear about a challenging environment and SKU reduction, yet we saw positive sales growth in both Australia and Europe. Can you give us just a little bit of color -- and I know that mix is hurting the profit, but can you give us a little bit of color on the strength of the top line?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yeah, so what I\u2019d say is -- and if you compare it to prior quarters, both Europe and Asia-Pacific sales were up a lot. I wouldn\u2019t get too excited about that, I guess. In the U.K., or in Europe the big thing driving that is in the previous year in the fourth quarter when the governments announced the duty increase, which as you\u2019ll recall was pretty sizable. They gave a decent amount of time between the announcement and the implementation of the duty increase, so it gave everybody quite a while to sort of buy in a lot of product ahead of the duty increase, and what that ended up doing was it sort of kept our first quarter sales lower as that inventory sold through. This year when the duty increase was announced, there was no time between announcement and execution, so that duty buy-in didn\u2019t happen. So it\u2019s sort of a technical year-over-year selling activity which should even out over time. Really what happened is inventory got built up, so that\u2019s sort of Europe. ", "And in Asia-Pacific, it\u2019s more related again to some timing of sales into mostly the Japanese market, which I think will also even out over time. The other thing to keep into account is unfortunately sales in these two regions have a much lower margin than sales in North America, so as sales growth accelerates versus North America in any quarter, that tends to be a negative geographic mix shift for us. ", "Christine Farkas - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Got it. Thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Rob, I was surprised to hear you comment that you didn\u2019t expect disruption this summer with the plans to consolidate wine and spirit sales into fewer distributors. Could you -- I may have missed it but could you tell us when that was announced for the trade? Is that happening today? ", "And then talk a little bit about why you don\u2019t expect too much disruption and I take it if you don\u2019t, that you don\u2019t have disruption in your guidance of $1.60 to $1.70?", "Robert S. Sands", "I think you asked when we\u2019re announcing for the trade, is that was you asked?", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Yeah. ", "Robert S. Sands", "You know, we expect that we should be announcing for the trade actually fairly shortly, within the next 30, 60 days, something to that effect, and it might not be all at once, so it\u2019s not necessarily a big kind of a thing. And then to your second question, you know, in planning for how we would handle the changes that we are going to be making related to the consolidation, operationally we obviously put in place some mitigation plans and there are some natural things that occur when you make these movements that tend to offset each other, such as when you are moving the brands, you\u2019ve got inventory moving around, shipments to new distributors, et cetera. So when you balance everything out, we really don\u2019t think that it will have a huge impact on retail sales. We think that depletion should be somewhat stable. There might be some loss from distributors who are losing brands, some pick-up from distributors who are gaining brands and actually the same kind of thing on the shipment side.", "So we expect it at this time to balance out. You know, if there were any timing issues, which is probably the worst-case scenario, you know, we -- well, let me just put it this way; at the current time, we don\u2019t expect any significant timing issues related to the distributor transition between second quarter and third quarter. And as we move into third quarter, it should be largely complete. I think the thing should be stabilized, which was part of the idea, which was to get this done before OND -- October, November, and December, which is one of the key selling seasons. ", "So a lot of operational planning has gone into this, Mark, to ensure that we mitigate any possible disruption. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, great, and am I right that today\u2019s comments on this call are the first the trade\u2019s actually hearing of these intentions?", "Robert S. Sands", "No, no -- the trade is well aware of our intention and is well aware of what we are both doing internally with the sales organization, meaning the consolidation of the operating companies in the sales organization and we\u2019ve been involved in an intensive RFC, request for -- we call it a request for commitment as opposed to a request for proposal. We\u2019ve been involved in a heavy RFC process with the distributors now for several months and are in the process of final negotiations as we sit here right now. So there\u2019s -- everybody knows what\u2019s going on, basically. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Great. Thank you, Rob, that\u2019s helpful. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JP Morgan.", "John Faucher - JP Morgan", "Good morning. I apologize; I seem to be getting confused about something. You started off the conference call by saying I believe that the category was up about 5% and high-end was growing at the same pace, and then you talked about a shift into some of the higher priced wines, at least from a volume standpoint. And it sounded like the category mix was coming down at the -- sort of at the very low end, of if -- I apologize. I\u2019m trying to figure out why the mix is such an issue when what continues to come up, it seems like, is the high-end stuff seems to be holding up and growing at roughly the same pace as the category. And if you could talk about that sort of on a total category basis, as well as just for your portfolio. Thanks. ", "Robert S. Sands", "What is the case as you look at the total industry, you see the total industry growing at lower -- about 3%. When we said 5%, I was talking dollars, not volume, so 3% on a volume basis, 5% on a dollar basis, which in and of itself, this is total wine, would be indicative of the continuation of the general trade-up trend. So you see super premium plus, which starts at $8, growing at about 6% both in volume and dollars versus the total industry at 3% volume and 5% dollars. I\u2019m quoting IRI figures. ", "Now, within our -- that doesn\u2019t mean, however, that within the respected categories that there might not be -- and in fact I think that there is  to some degree some trading down. So take the super premium category, okay, which might -- which ranges from $8 to $12. The highest end of that category is being more negatively affected or being negatively affected versus the lower end. People are looking for bargains even within the respective categories. So when we talk about trading up in general, it does continue to be a phenomena in the marketplace as measured by either the difference of the total business in volumes and dollar sales or by looking at say the whole super premium plus category versus the value category. ", "Now, there\u2019s also some trading down going on from the high-end of the segment of the wine business, so wines over $15, over $20, there\u2019s clearly some trading down that\u2019s going on in those categories as well, and our high-end portfolio, which is our highest gross margin portfolio, sold by Icon, which is -- what we used to call Icon; well, it still is Icon, actually. It won\u2019t be much longer but the white table cloth on-premise branded brands are definitely being hurt in the economy. You can call it trading down, you could say that it\u2019s also an impact that the economic downturn is having on the on-premise in particular. ", "So the highest margin brands in our portfolio, which are more on-premise oriented, are being negatively affected by the economic impact, especially on the restaurant business. ", "So it\u2019s hard not to confuse sort of general trends with what is very specifically going on; in our case, as I said, the highest end of our portfolio is being negatively affected and some of the -- even within premium, some of the lower premium products, everyday products like Woodbridge, which is premium by definition, are growing at a fairly rapid rate. So this is what\u2019s causing the negative mix shift. ", "Robert P. Ryder", "So John, just a little bit of background math, when we are talking negative mix, we\u2019re talking to previous year, okay? So what we are seeing is what Rob just said -- the total wine category is growing pretty consistently with prior years, say 4% to 5%. The brands below $5 are going a lot faster than they were last year, okay? The brands above $5 a bottle at retail are growing slower than last year but the brands above $5 a bottle are still growing in line with the total category. They used to grow faster than the total category. ", "So when we say mix shift, we\u2019re talking year over year and you can see if you look at IRI or Nielsen data that the lower priced brand -- this is across beverage alcohol, right? We see the same thing in our beer portfolio -- the lower priced brands are now growing much faster than they were last year. The higher priced brands are not growing as fast as they did last year. They are all still in growth. ", "John Faucher - JP Morgan", "Okay, so to be technical, what\u2019s really going on is it\u2019s actually a lack of a mix shift -- you\u2019ve been getting the more positive mix shift in the past. If everything is growing at the same pace, and I realize that\u2019s a generalization, then you are not getting the positive mix shift that you are used to, so I think that\u2019s -- is that -- if everything -- if the low-end and the high-end are both growing 5%, then it\u2019s the lack of a positive mix shift as opposed to a mix shift?", "Robert P. Ryder", "That is correct. ", "John Faucher - JP Morgan", "Okay. ", "Robert P. Ryder", "We\u2019ve had less of a positive mix [shift] -- that\u2019s a fine way to put it. ", "John Faucher - JP Morgan", "Okay, I got it. Great. Thanks so much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin [Dryer] with [Cavelli] & Company.", "Kevin Dryer - Cavelli & Company", "I just have a question on your margin -- on your margin changes. What kind of driving -- you\u2019re saying that you\u2019ve got efficiency initiatives offsetting the negative mix shift. Should that accelerate then as the year goes on, since you said you\u2019ve got this $25 million coming in this year, going to $50 million next year?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, I think that\u2019s true because we will have -- of the $25 million in savings, okay, we\u2019ll see much more of that in Q2, Q3, Q4. We would also hope that the gross margin might improve a bit if the economy starts to improve a bit but we\u2019re not really relying on that. ", "Kevin Dryer - Cavelli & Company", "What drove the increase in the EBIT margin for the wine and spirits division this quarter? What were the costs you took out, or did you pull back on marketing or -- what were the specific items that helped it this quarter?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Most of it was around SG&A, okay? The two big things were -- the first was our global cost initiative, which we started last year. We saw a reasonable amount of savings of that in Q1. The other piece -- ", "Kevin Dryer - Cavelli & Company", "-- people?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, primarily people, I\u2019m sorry, yes. And the other thing, the other big ticket item, which again was primarily people, when we sold our value spirits business, which used to be an entire segment with a lot of very capable people in mostly Chicago running the business, we took the two largest, highest gross profit margin brands and we plugged them into our North American wine business to leverage that SG&A and unfortunately again, we had to eliminate the spirits SG&A, which resided in the ex spirits segments. That actually for this quarter provided quite a bit of SG&A savings for us. That\u2019s a permanent savings that the people are no longer within the company. ", "Kevin Dryer - Cavelli & Company", "Okay, and then in terms of the distributor transition, I guess I\u2019d have to agree with the previous comment, not totally clear to me why there wouldn\u2019t be some disruption but I guess all that being said, what\u2019s the reason for it? Why -- what are you seeing in your business that makes you decide you need to go with fewer distributors now and what\u2019s changed versus how you did things previously?", "Robert S. Sands", "It\u2019s really very related to the dramatic change in our portfolio. When we had a significant value wine and spirits portfolio with many brands that competed with each other and that were fairly generic and low margin in nature, the only model that really worked for selling that was to put brands that competed against each other in different -- with different distributors. Okay, we had a huge number of brands as well, so it made sense to split the portfolio in a given market between different distributors to get better prioritization against each set of brands that each distributor had and then to also get more effort against competing brands. So you have two vodkas selling at the same price that are basically what we call well products, meaning they don\u2019t go on the back bar, nobody knows what brand it is. Okay, you were better off having two distributors sell the two different brands that one, because you\u2019d get more exposure to different outlets. ", "With the elimination of our value spirits portfolio and our value wine business, and the really the narrowing down of our portfolio to a relatively small number of brands that are fairly well-differentiated -- I mean, really just about 10, 12 brands that are the key Constellation brands, you know, we are able then to focus -- one distributor can number one, prioritize those brands and we don\u2019t have the issue of selling largely generic inter-competitive product. ", "At the same time, if we consolidate our portfolio with a single distributor in a market, Constellation today is in the top three largest operating profit providers to the U.S. distribution network in general and in the top two largest gross profit providers to the U.S. distribution network. ", "Now, if you\u2019ve got your portfolio split in half, half of it with one distributor in a market and half of it with another distributor in a market, you know, you don\u2019t get the full benefit of your size and strength and the contribution that you are making to the distributor, because they only have 50% of the business and thus 50% of the margins, whereas today, many of our -- many of the major spirits producers are consolidated in the marketplace, so it was really two-fold, as I said. It was the change in our portfolio facility facilitated the change with a narrower portfolio of much more highly differentiated brands. And then number two, it gives us -- it increases dramatically our level of importance to each individual distributor that we are consolidated with. ", "Kevin Dryer - Cavelli & Company", "Great. Thank you. And then maybe just one final one -- on [inaudible] big brand, continues to grow at a very healthy clip. How much of that is new distribution versus just increased consumption, you know, where you are already selling it, share gains versus other brands? And also, how much of that do you think is just benefiting from some trade-down within premium vodkas from the luxury vodkas down to a price point like SVEDKA?", "Robert P. Ryder", "I\u2019d say yes, yes, and yes. SVEDKA is really hitting on all cylinders, so even in places like New York City where it has heavy penetration, okay, we still see per capita consumption increases. We\u2019re also focusing on increasing penetration on the West Coast where it\u2019s under-represented in the Vodka category. And the marketing and sales guys are spending a lot of time on that and we are seeing some success there. ", "And also the economy is certainly helping SVEDKA because it is at a price point for a 750-millilitre, save off $10 a bottle, so my guess is is getting some sales from products like the Kettle One and Grey Goose, which are say $20 to $30, so two to three times that price point, because SVEDKA offers the premium positioning. It has all the marketing glitz and it\u2019s a great tasting product like those others. It\u2019s just more affordable. ", "So I\u2019d say it\u2019s a very good product in general and it\u2019s an even better product in these economic times and we are seeing the results of that. I mean, it will be above 2 million cases at the end of this fiscal year. That is a sizable spirits brand and it\u2019s still growing in the high double-digits. We\u2019re -- it\u2019s pretty amazing. The team there, the commercial team is doing a fantastic job with that product. ", "Kevin Dryer - Cavelli & Company", "Great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Watson with HSBC.", "James Watson - HSBC", "Good morning, everyone. I had a question about the cost environment in the quarter. You mentioned -- well, we saw the gross margin come down but you also mentioned that value wines in the U.S., the prices were being taken up. I mean, is that -- are they both caused by the same thing, by any underlying increase in grape costs? Or are they just separate from [inaudible]?", "Robert P. Ryder", "So within cost of goods, we did see some increase in grape costs and we did see some increase in glass costs, okay, across the portfolio. But we also saw generally a mix shift to -- even if those were the same, we saw mix shift towards lower gross profit margin product, so that -- those three things were the big movers in the gross profit mix shift. But again, we offset most of those with our SG&A reduction initiatives. ", "James Watson - HSBC", "Okay, and this increase in value pricing was in the U.S. -- have you seen it anywhere else? I mean, especially the U.K. or is the environment in the first quarter in the U.K. just as competitive as it was in the fourth quarter? ", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yeah, when we see the pricing, really we can see this in the spirits, the beer, and the wine category in the value segments. You actually see pricing and I guess positive mix shift in the value segment. We see that in North America across all the beverage alcohol categories. The U.K. is a very different market in that there\u2019s kind of a price ceiling there that\u2019s put in mostly by the retailers who use beverage alcohol to sort of just get people in the stores. ", "So although -- you know, we do see a general, a mix shift positive in the U.K. In our category and in wine, we\u2019re still seeing a pretty much in total a stabilization of that price point. There\u2019s kind of a ceiling there, which impacts everybody\u2019s margin in beverage alcohol in the U.K. ", "James Watson - HSBC", "Great. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Brian Hunt with Wachovia.", "Brian Hunt - Wachovia", "Thank you. I\u2019m glad to make it under the wire. I was wondering if you could just talk about the potential costs associated with your distribution transition. It sounds like there\u2019s a lot of moving parts. And also if you could clarify whether or not -- again, this will be something where you flip a switch and all these states at one time [or are you going] by a state-by-state basis and execute this plan?", "Robert S. Sands", "Yeah, you know, in terms of costs, there\u2019s a lot of puts and takes and obviously that\u2019s all built into our guidance for the year. Patty or [Bob] can talk to you more about that if you would like but you know, nothing that you should be particularly concerned about. And relative to flipping a switch, as I said it will all be put in place over the next say 60 days-ish, you know, not everything will happen simultaneously but it will be in place prior to the beginning of the key selling season, beginning with October. So 60, 90 days. ", "Brian Hunt - Wachovia", "Okay, and my last question would be looking at your organic net sales growth on North American wine relative to the IRI data you\u2019re recording, it appears that [the overall losses] of share during the period, could you maybe clarify that -- those statements that you made and where do you feel like, if you did lose share, where were you losing share? In what segment? And maybe why?", "Robert S. Sands", "Yeah, well, you know, our growth is a bit behind the general growth but in general, we don\u2019t really operate the business, okay, on the basis of maintaining share, especially in the short-term in a largely fragmented category. You know, it\u2019s not the same kind of thing as if you are selling potato chips. Now, we\u2019ve also taken pricing during the period, so if you look at our average pricing versus the same period a year ago, it\u2019s up and that always has an impact on share and also that if you just look in general at our volume growth versus our dollar growth, our dollar growth is ahead of our volume growth. Again, related to pricing, which will have some impact on share. You know, we\u2019re growing generally in line with our respective categories. We could be off a bit here and there but again, we are much more concerned about striking the right balance between profit and volume as opposed to just worrying about share per se. ", "Also, we have had -- as a -- there\u2019s probably a couple hundred basis points of impact on SKU -- of SKU rationalization that -- we know that that\u2019s flowing through at least on the shipment side and flowing through to depletion. You know, retail sales lag a little bit but you know, there is an impact of SKU rationalization on the retail numbers as well. ", "So you know, we have large brands, large brands aren\u2019t going to grow as fast as small new brands, so in general we are happy and tend to look at our growth rates for our brands on an absolute basis, meaning are they growing at the rate we think is important. Like a brand like Woodbridge, as opposed to, you know, is it taking share versus all the little brands that are coming and going in the marketplace. ", "Robert P. Ryder", "The other -- I\u2019ll just add another math comment in that we are under-represented share wise in the below $5 a bottle, and as we said earlier, that is growing much faster than the above $5 a bottle, so if you look at total wine category and our share of wine category, a lot of our share loss would be the fact that we\u2019ve chosen not to participate heavily in the under $5 a bottle at retail and we\u2019ve made that decision because the profit margins at that level are kind of less than we would want. ", "So that\u2019s kind of one of the math reasons why we are losing share total. In the premium plus category, so $5 a bottle and more, we\u2019re pretty close to growing with that category. It\u2019s much less demonstrative. ", "Robert S. Sands", "And when Bob talks about the value category growing faster, it\u2019s on a dollar basis, not on a volume basis. It\u2019s growing slower on a volume basis and faster on a dollar basis. ", "Robert P. Ryder", "Correct. I was talking all dollars, sorry. ", "Brian Hunt - Wachovia", "Well, thank you for clarifying that and thanks for taking my questions. ", "Operator", "At this time, I will turn the call back to Rob Sands for closing remarks. ", "Robert S. Sands", "Well, thank you, everybody, for joining our call today. I would say that we are off to a solid start in fiscal 2010, despite the ongoing challenges from a tough macro environment that everybody is facing. ", "Now, during the quarter, we did decrease debt, we realized the benefit from our cost reduction efforts and in doing so, we improved our operating margins. I believe we are well-positioned to achieve our free cash flow and EPS goals for the year. I am especially excited about the implementation of our new distributor initiative and go-to-market strategy. We\u2019ll certainly have more to say about this in the next coming weeks and next quarter when we talk to you again. ", "Now in addition, we are planning on an investor day in New York for the early to mid November timeframe, so stay tuned for the details on that. And thank you again for your participation and we hope you are able to enjoy some of our great products during the upcoming Fourth of July weekend.

Good morning everyone and welcome to Constellation\u2019s third quarter 2010 conference call.

Welcome to our discussion of Constellation\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2010 sales and earnings results. Before we get started I would like to thank those of you who attended our recent New York City Investor Meeting. I hope one of your key take aways from that meeting is that Constellation is evolving as a fundamentally different company that is better positioned than ever to deliver value. ", "We are focused on executing a strategy into the foreseeable future that delivers this value through organic growth, enhanced profitability, free cash flow and ROIC. The third quarter is evidence of the fact we continue to make progress against our strategic goals of generating cash, paying down debt and reducing costs. During the quarter we advanced our portfolio transformation with the announcement of our agreement to sell our U.K. cider business to C&C Group for approximately $70 million. ", "The Gaymer Cider Company was originally acquired in 1998 with the Massey Clark business. This transaction is consistent with our strategic focus on premium, higher growth, higher margin wine, beer and spirits brands. The deal is on track to close by mid-January and we expect to use the proceeds to further reduce our borrowings. ", "During the quarter we also progressed with transition activities associated with our US distributor consolidation effort which now encompasses 22 states representing approximately 60% of our total US wine and spirits volume. As you know, the initial distributor transition commenced September 1st with the second quarter benefiting from the implementation of this program. At that time, actions were taken to ensure maximum levels of customer service between distributor and the retail customers during the transition period. ", "Now these actions had the planned effect of moving a portion of third quarter sales into the second quarter and resulted in some inventory build at the distributors. During the third quarter consumer take away was softer than expected at the beginning of the quarter but it is improving as our new selling model and promotional efforts take effect. As a result, at the end of the third quarter distributor inventories were higher than historically targeted levels. However, as you can see from the latest IRI data through December our US wine trends have improved from where they were early in the third quarter as our promotional activities have returned to more normal levels. ", "From an overall marketplace perspective, in the IRI channel growth in the US wine market remains healthy at about 4% on a dollar basis according to recent 12-week data with the greater than $8 price segment growing in the high single digit range. The on-premise channel remains challenging although we believe it is stabilizing and the mass merchandise club channel is outperforming the food and drug channels. ", "Despite the fact that many of our planned promotional activities were not implemented until late in the quarter many of our leading, well known brands continue to perform well in the marketplace throughout the third quarter including Robert Mondavi\u2019s Private Selection and brands like [Goliath] and Kim Crawford. And we recently received some noteworthy portfolio awards. Two of our wines were selected to be served at President Barack Obama\u2019s prestigious Nobel Prize banquet in Oslo and included the 2003 Inniskillin Gold oak aged Vidal Icewine and the 2005 Robert Mondavi Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon. ", "In addition, Wine.com recently released their top brand list for 2009 showcasing the top wines sold through their website. Five Constellation wines made that list. Five made that list including Robert Mondavi, Kim Crawford, [Shimi], Hogue and Clos du Bois. ", "Our third quarter spirits net sales results are not representative of strong underlying performance because SVEDKA Vodka shipments this quarter are being compared against last year\u2019s third quarter which was impacted by some unique circumstances. Glass shortages related to new bottling changes for SVEDKA in last year\u2019s second quarter drove strong shipments in last year\u2019s third quarter creating the difficult comparison. ", "Despite this issue, SVEDKA posted another strong quarter of double digit depletion growth with our year-to-date net sales increasing more than 40%. We continue to build SVEDKA\u2019s on premise brand awareness by leveraging new distributor roots to market. We are growing our national accounts in on and off-premise channels and are expanding in other core markets outside the US. ", "Moving to the Canadian wine business, the overall business continues to be impacted by economically driven negative mix trends. However, positive sales results were recorded by Naked Grape during the quarter which is one of the leading premium brands in our wine portfolio. As you know, Vincor is a sponsor of the upcoming Winter Olympic Games scheduled for mid-February in Vancouver. We expect to fully capitalize on the brand building opportunities we have planned in connection with this event. ", "Now moving to our international businesses. The challenges impacting the operating environment in Australia and the U.K. have not subsided. However, as you know we continue to execute the previously announced restructuring of our businesses in these geographies in order to align them with the reality of their respective markets. This includes continuing to focus on cost reductions, decreasing network and capital investment and consolidating our overall footprint in these markets in order to increase efficiencies. ", "In the short term, we are optimistic about our marketplace performance especially in the U.K. during the holiday selling season. In early November we announced we were working towards the potential combination of portions of our U.K. and Australian operations with Australian Vintage Limited in an effort improve the prospect of these businesses going forward. I have nothing new to report at this time as we continue working to bring this transaction to a successful conclusion. ", "Moving to the Crown Imports joint venture, as you know we recently received notice of legal action by Modello pertaining to the funding of the JV partners of an immaterial amount of incremental promotional and marketing dollars for the upcoming calendar year 2010. Previously Modello provided this incremental spending and had agreed to do so once again for the 2010 business plan year. My point in addressing this issue is to remind everyone that the Crown joint venture is not a party to this legal action. Crown\u2019s 2010 business plan has already been agreed upon by Modello and Constellation and the JV will go forward with a focus on growing the business through the entire term of this contract. ", "We intend to continue working closely with Crown to support the joint venture as it continues to operate its business and deliver products in a manner designed to meet or exceed the expectations of consumers, distributor and retail customers. ", "Now moving to Crown\u2019s operational results for the third quarter, during the quarter sales and operating income for the Crown joint venture continued to be impacted by economically driven challenges in the on-premise and convenience store channels. Operating income in particular was unfavorably impacted not only by the volume decline but by the timing of national media programming for Major League Baseball and the National Football League that occurred in the third quarter. However, depletion trends outpaced shipments in the quarter due in part to the favorable impact of these media programs and resulted in temporary wholesaler inventory reductions. ", "Crown is also realizing stabilizing trends and import category share gain in the grocery channel where it is performing in line with the US Beer industry and outperforming the imported beer category. We believe this is a result of targeted marketing efforts and programming against its key channel. Recent IRI data coinciding with the end of our third quarter confirms improved performance across the Crown portfolio.

What gives us confidence we can achieve these goals? Crown continues to execute well at retail with solid promotional activity, marketing programs and the rollout of new products and packaging. Expanded distribution has helped to increase selection, retail impact and price point options for consumers. These efforts have resulted in over 60,000 new points of distribution since August 1st.

As you know, Jay Wright, President of our North American Wine Organization who many of you met at our recent New York investor meeting will continue to lead the business as we have cultivated strong management continuity in the face of Jose\u2019s passing.

Our Q3 comparable EPS came in at $0.54 versus $0.60 in the previous year. The quarter witnessed quite a few unfavorable timing impacts across most product categories. ", "US wine was impacted by the shift of sales from Q3 to Q2. Spirit sales growth was impacted by a previous year glass shortage for SVEDKA and Crown\u2019s profits were impacted by unfavorable sales timing and marketing expense timing in the quarter. In addition to these quarterly timing-related items, North American wine depletion did not begin to improve until late in the quarter, our international business continued to experience gross margin pressures and Crown\u2019s beer business continued to be impacted by the economy. ", "We believe the negative timing events will correct themselves this year and we also believe we have strategies in place to improve the more fundamental challenges facing the business. We have continued taking steps to strengthen our organic business model and we are seeing good progress in a number of areas. As we continue to reduce costs which has helped offset the impact of consumer shifts to lower margin products in this challenging economic environment, focus on generating free cash flow as we are targeting to be in the high end of our full-year free cash flow guidance range, reduce debt and interest expense and work with our consolidated distributor base in the US to drive improvement in our organic sales and mix trends. ", "We saw good promotion and displays for our brands during the holiday season and began to see some improving depletion and marketplace trends in US wine and beer as the quarter progressed. Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the quarter was 35%. We also project a full year rate of approximately 35% versus our previous targeted full-year rate of 38%. The Q3 rate drove about $0.03 to $0.04 of EPS favorability in the quarter when looked at in relation to the previous full-year tax rate projection of 38%. ", "Now let\u2019s look at our Q3 P&L performance in more detail where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Let\u2019s go to the net sales line. As you can see from our news release on page 13, our consolidated reported net sales decreased 4% primarily due to the divestiture of our Value Spirits business partially offset by the positive impact of year-over-year currency exchange rate fluctuations. ", "On an organic constant currency basis which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and forex, net sales were even with the prior year. My commentary for the following net sales comparisons will be on a constant currency basis. Our worldwide branded wine organic net sales which appear on page 12 of the release were even versus last year. This included a 3% decrease for North America offset by an increase of 12% in Europe and 2% in Australia and New Zealand. ", "North American sales were impacted by continuing economic challenges, higher levels of promotional spending and the shift of sales from the second quarter to the third quarter as part of the US distributor transition activities. We estimate this shift represented approximately $40-50 million in net sales and about $0.05 to $0.07 of EPS. ", "For Europe sales benefited from increased volumes for our value priced product offerings in the U.K. and an easier comparison versus Q3 last year. Spirits organic net sales decreased 2% for the quarter. Rob has already discussed the difficult comparison item we faced in the quarter. ", "Now let\u2019s look at our profits on a comparable basis using information on page 14 of the release. For Q3 our consolidated gross margin was 35.4% versus 40% in the prior-year quarter. This reflects lower sales driven by the shift of US sales from Q3 to Q2, higher promotion costs in the US, higher Australian COGS due to the flow through of the more expensive calendar 2008 harvest and negative sales mix in the U.K. and Australia. On a year-to-date basis gross margins are down 2.3 percentage points, much less than the Q3 figure, again reflecting the many unfavorable timing aspects of Q3. ", "The higher promotion costs in the US represented a proactive effort to shift more promotion dollars into the second half of the year as we transition to our new distributor partners. Our consolidated SG&A for the quarter was 16.1% of net sales compared to 18.8% a year ago. The reduction was primarily driven by our global initiatives, lower marketing expense and the elimination of our spirit SG&A commensurate with the sale of the Value Spirits business. ", "Consolidated operating income decreased 13% to $190 million and operating margin decreased 1.9 percentage points to 19.3%. Given some of the shifts between Q2 and Q3 that I have discussed it is important to look at our Q3 year-to-date operating margin of 18.1% which is up 1.1 percentage points versus Q3 year-to-date last year. Our appropriate stewardship of SG&A spend more than offset the reduction in our gross profit margin on a year-to-date basis. ", "I would like now to turn to our segment operating income results on page 11 of the release to provide highlights of our Q3 operating income change. Wine segment operating income decreased $22 million to $218 million. The decrease was primarily due to the Q2 sales shift, higher promotion costs in the US, divestiture of the value spirits business and the decrease in international business profit margins due to negative mix and higher grade costs for our Australian wine. These items were partially offset by savings from our SG&A reduction initiatives. ", "For the quarter corporate and other expenses totaled $28 million versus $22 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by costs related to project fusion, our multi-year program designed to strengthen our global business system and processes as well as our efforts to improve our U.K. and Australian businesses including the possibility of combining portions of these businesses with Australian Vintage Limited. ", "On page 14 you can see consolidated equity investment earnings totaled $60 million versus $76 million last year. Equity earnings for Crown totaled $46 million versus $62 million. The remainder of equity earnings in Q3 fiscal 2010 and Q3 fiscal 2009 are primarily generated by Opus One. ", "For the third quarter Crown generated net sales of $499 million, a decrease of 10% and operating income of $91 million, a decrease of 26%. Economic challenges continued to drive soft performance in the convenience and on-premise channel and consumer movement to lower price beer. Q3 witnessed an unfavorable sales timing which we expect to reverse in Q4 as depletion trends improve and outpace shipments during the quarter. ", "Crown continues to execute on its targeted promotional marketing support and new package introductions to drive share improvement in the grocery channel import category. Operating income for Crown was impacted by lower net sales, marketing expense timing related to national media for Corona Extra and Corona Light and a contractual cost increase. ", "Interest expense for the quarter was $64 million, down 18% versus last year. The decrease was primarily driven by our significant debt reduction actions during the last 12 months. ", "Let\u2019s take a look at our debt position. At the end of November our debt totaled $4.1 billion which represents a $336 million decrease from our debt level at the end of 2009. The decrease primarily reflects the proceeds received from the sale of the Value Spirits business and positive free cash flow. Our average interest rate for the quarter was around 6.2%. Our debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio at the end of November was 4.2 times versus 4.3 times at the end of fiscal 2009. Proceeds from the pending sale of our U.K. Cider business combined with targeted free cash flow generation in Q4 should reduce this ratio to the high 3 times range by the end of fiscal 2010. ", "We feel that our strong cash flow, reduced leverage, improved credit profile and much improved credit markets make this quarter and appropriate time to offer to extend our revolving credit facility. We will most likely initiate this process in the very near term. ", "Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 35% which reflects the favorable outcome of various tax items. The rate for Q3 fiscal 2009 was 39%. As mentioned earlier, we now project our full-year comparable basis tax rate to approximate 35% which is much improved versus the previous guidance of 38%. ", "Now let\u2019s turn to cash flow on page 10 of the news release. For purposes of this discussion, free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the nine months of fiscal 2010 we generated free cash flow of $100 million versus $235 million in the prior year. The lower cash generation is due primarily to higher taxes paid including approximately $65 million related to the sale of the Value Spirits business. ", "In addition, timing of sales in the quarter resulted in higher US receivable balances. This higher receivable balance more than offset by inventory reductions and lower fiscal 2010 grape harvest costs in Australia, New Zealand and the US versus the prior year and less interest paid. As a reminder, free cash flow for the first nine months of fiscal 2009 reflected a benefit of approximately $85 million in pre-tax proceeds related to the favorable settlement of certain foreign currency hedges. ", "For fiscal 2010 we now expect CapEx to be in a range of $130-150 million versus our previous $150-170 million projection. The reduction in planned CapEx spending is contributing to free cash flow targeted at the upper end of our $230-270 million guidance range. ", "Moving to our P&L outlook for full year fiscal 2010, we still expect comparable basis EPS to be in a range of $1.60 to $1.70 with reduced full-year expected tax rate of approximately 35%. Our comparable basis guidance excludes acquisition related integration costs, restructuring charges and unusual items which are detailed on page 17. ", "During Q3 we recognized approximately $60 million of impairment and other charges related to Rufino, an Italian wine company in which we have a 40% ownership interest. This includes a $25 million non-cash impairment for this equity method investment as the financial performance of this business continues to decline due in part to the strengthening of the Euro versus the US dollar. In addition a $45 million charge was reported as a 10% shareholder of Rufino gave notice of its intent to exercise a put option to Constellation at a contracted option price determined at the 2004 acquisition date. This put essentially represents the deferred purchase price from the 2004 investment that we expect to pay in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. ", "Before we take your questions I would like to note we are working to leverage the benefits of our distributor consolidation initiative and leverage our P&L through expense management and increased operational efficiency. We plan to use free cash flow to further de-lever and reduce interest expense. All of this activity should drive improvement in our organic business model and ROIC.

Can you help give us a read on why the range is as wide as it is? ", "Robert Ryder ", "", "We kept the EPS range at $0.10 when normally in the third quarter we might tighten it a little bit by $0.02 or so. I think it was because of the continued vibrations in the economy and perhaps if it follows through the potential cost of the refinancing of the revolver. They are the two big reasons.

It is just more terms of lack of visibility on what core trends are versus where they would have been six months ago? ", "Robert Ryder ", "", "I think that is fair. We just felt we would like to keep the range at the $0.10 given all the uncertainty as our depletions continue to improve in both beer and in wine but we are not sure what is going to happen in the economy and we are still fine tuning our distributor transition. ", "Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Warburg", "At Crown, how do you feel about where the inventory levels are currently at the distributors? There is obviously a big spread between your trends in depletions. What should we expect in the relationship between the two over the next quarter or so? ", "Robert Ryder ", "", "Generally in the beer business, shipments and depletions are prealigned. This is actually a good news story in that we feel that we were able to get some pretty good media buys because the prices came down in the advertising market over some peak sporting events and actually the sporting events had pretty high ratings. They were actually some pretty good games if you remember back to that. So we think they were good buys and we do think that drove some increased depletions in the quarter. The level of increased depletion surprised us a little bit so we had a slight de-stocking in the beer channel which I think will be replenished in the fourth quarter.

I guess I am just trying to get a better sense of with the holiday season obviously being more promotional maybe there is some discounting in there and is that really just driving that momentum or do you think it is coming from somewhere else? So with on-premise still being weak and convenience stores being weak is it just kind of consumers buying in here at lower prices and your lower price brands doing better or do you feel you are really seeing some difference here versus last quarter? ", "Robert Sands ", "", "First of all that comment was relative to our business, not the industry in general. The industry in general although is performing well. I would say it has been fairly consistent as opposed to there being an uptick. In our business on the wine side yes we are seeing some improved performance. I think that is generally as a result of the fact that a lot of our efforts for instance our distributor consolidation and the increase of our promotional activities in the third quarter these things are now kicking in and we really are starting to see some positive impact on that in late third quarter and we have seen some of the positive impact of that into December and the holiday season. ", "We are pretty optimistic that things are working pretty well at this stage on the wine side. On the beer side, as much as Bob said we had some very good media. The media I think drove some pretty strong sales particularly in grocery. We are seeing some stabilization on the on-premise side. I would say the convenience sector still remains highly challenged. ", "On beer, I would say that while we are generally pleased and optimistic with the performance we are nevertheless still believing that we will be down from a depletion perspective mid single digits for the year because in general that segment, the import segment although we are way outperforming the competitors. That segment still remains pretty challenged in the beer business. ", "Lauren Torres - HSBC", "So would you say for beer and wine both on-premise and convenience that generally it has been stable, not getting worse? ", "Robert Sands ", "", "Well convenience isn\u2019t a big factor for wine. For beer it is the largest channel. So two completely different things. In terms of, no I don\u2019t think it is getting worse but as I said it remains a pretty challenged segment but let me just reiterate for wine it is not a factor. For beer it is a significant factor.

Any real changes there from your comments last quarter? ", "Robert Sands ", "", "Not really. By the way in general I would say trading up has picked up and fundamentally there isn\u2019t trading down in that the higher priced segments are now growing much faster than the lower price segments with the super premium plus category growing high single digits again. That said, I still would say that within category there is some trading down going on. I would say categories mean price segments. So if you look at the $10-15 segment within that there will be some trading down towards the lower end of that segment versus the higher end or if you are looking even the higher end segments there will be some trading down. ", "Fundamentally there is trading up although within segments there is trading down and therefore there can be some negative mix shift which is the case.

We will see mass merchandise grow faster than that. We will see on-premise grow slower than that. There is going to be puts and takes.

", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "On CapEx, 130-150 is the guidance for the current fiscal year but the 150 number seems rather large unless you have something large in the way of spending happening in the current quarter. That is part one of my CapEx question and then I have a follow-up. ", "Robert Ryder ", "", "I would say we are a pretty big business and in every industry I have been in the wide majority of your capital spend occurs in the fourth quarter because sometimes it is the engineering school training that happens. I have been in a couple of different businesses so that is kind of happening. The other thing going on is the fusion ERP project we have going on that certainly we will be spending around that in the fourth quarter and there was very little if any in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. So that is probably the answer to that. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "That is the low visibility item back on the line of questioning Bill had? You would think that in January you would know what you are going to spend on that. Is that the item that has uncertainty to it? ", "Robert Ryder ", "", "There is a lot. Again as I said, the way you do a capital forecast there are thousands of projects that sort of roll up and it is very difficult to get\u2026the engineers always want to hold onto that capital forecast so we do the best we can to try to isolate the numbers and give the best guess we can. But you never know. So it could be a lot of projects get spent against and also the fusion project is a new project so there is no history against which we can look. We are relatively comfortable in bringing down that CapEx number and again the range is $20 million in a $250-270 million number. So there is a lot of moving parts in the cash flow forecast. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "I think you answered my follow-up. As we think longer term it sounds like last year the number was just shy of 130. There are some unusual items this year regardless of whether it is 130 or 150 for the fiscal year. It sounds like long term you think the number is closer to 130 than 150?", "Robert Ryder ", "", "I think that is a pretty narrow range for a long-term forecast. I think if I was you the long term forecast a fair number would be 130-150 and again because of where we are in the wine business we are pretty mature. We have all our facilities so our big use of capital is more around inventory than it is around capital spending. 130-150 I think is probably about 3.5% to 4% of sales which for us isn\u2019t a real big number. ", "Operator", "", "There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the floor back over to Mr. Robert Sands for any closing remarks. ", "Robert Sands ", "", "Thanks for joining our call today. Let me summarize what I think are the highlights of the third quarter as follows: First, we continued to benefit from our global cost reduction initiatives. Our full year free cash flow is targeted to be at the upper end of our guidance range. We reduced debt by more than $335 million since the beginning of our fiscal year. We continued our portfolio transformation efforts with the proposed sale of our cider business, the proceeds of which we expect to be used to further reduce our debt. We are experiencing improving depletion trends in our US wine, spirits and beer business. Lastly, we continue to progress with our distributor consolidation initiative. Our plan is to continue execution of our strategic initiatives throughout the final quarter of the year. ", "Finally, we will be providing guidance for our fiscal year 2011 during our next quarterly conference call scheduled for early April. Thank you again everybody for joining our call.

[Operator Instructions.] I would now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Patty Yahn-Urlaub", "Thank you operator. Good morning everyone, and welcome to Constellation's third quarter fiscal 2011 conference call. I am here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release which has also been furnished to the SEC.", "During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable organic and constant currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com under the Investor section.", "Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. Although statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company's estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings.", "And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.", "", "Rob Sands", "Thanks Patty, and good morning and happy New Year everyone. I hope you all had a great holiday and certainly had the opportunity to enjoy some of our fine products during the festive season. Now before we get started with a review of our third quarter results, I'd like to spend a few moments discussing the strategic intent behind the recent announcement of our plans to sell our U.K. and Australian business to CHAMP Private Equity.", "Since the time that we acquired Hardys in Australia and Matthew Clark, we have adopted a new business strategy which has been focused on premiumizing our portfolio, generating strong free cash flow, and improving return on invested capital, all in an effort to drive profitable organic growth. And the sale of the U.K. and Australia is the next transformational step in the execution of this strategy, as the business is no longer aligned with our strategic imperatives. ", "These international markets have been consistently challenged by foreign exchange volatility, grape oversupply, retail pricing pressures, and ongoing duty assessments which have collectively eroded profitability. And the majority of our sales volume in Australia has been dedicated to value-priced bag in the box products. However, we will continue to maintain a 20% interest in the business.", "As a private equity firm, CHAMP will be operating the business very differently, and our remaining interest will enable us to participate in the potential upside. All employees currently dedicated to this business will transfer to the new entity. Despite the sale of our two largest international businesses, Constellation remains the world's number one premium wine company, and we remain committed to growing an international operation that is consistent with our overall strategy. ", "Remember we currently sell and distribute our portfolio of brands in about 150 countries worldwide through Constellation Wines International, which will continue to invest resources in new, emerging, and established markets around the world. Constellation Wines International represents growth potential for the company going forward, and will continue to drive our premium portfolio around the world. ", "And now I would like to focus our discussion on our financial and operational results for the third quarter. This quarter marks the continuation of the strong momentum we've experienced this year in a number of areas which include the generation of record free cash flow levels that has been driven in part by our diligent focus, particularly in the area of working capital. ", "The great news about this new level of free cash flow is that we believe it is sustainable longer term. And, it was during last year's third quarter that we began the official transition for our new U.S. distributor network, giving select distributors the right to sell Constellation's portfolio of wine and spirits exclusively in their respective U.S. markets. ", "There seems to be some confusion related to the intricacies of the distributor contracts and their impact on our financial results since the inception of this initiative, which commenced September 1, 2009, so I will take a minute to describe how you should be thinking about the nuances of these contracts.", "We initially negotiated long-term contracts with five U.S. distributors currently representing about 60% of our wine and spirits volume in the U.S. These contracts included shipment commitments that required distributors to purchase specified levels of product in fiscal 2010 and during this fiscal year, 2011. ", "Last year, depletions or distributor sales to retail lagged our shipments to distributors due to the challenging economic environment and the disruption caused by the distributor transition activity and our sales force reorganization. In fiscal 2011, while depletion trends for our products are healthy, they have not caught up to the contractual shipment levels.", "As a result, our sales volumes to distributors are exceeding distributor sales to retail and on-premise channels. This has benefitted sales and profits for our U.S. wine business and will create an EBIT comparison challenge for fiscal 2012. After the shipment commitments roll off at the end of fiscal 2011, under the distributor contract we expect shipments to essentially equal depletions for the remainder of the contract term on an annual basis.", "This was absolutely the best way to execute the distributor contracts as it ensured more stable sales, earnings, and cash flow, as well as complete distributor focus on the Constellation portfolio of products during the transition period.", "So, to put things into perspective relative to how Constellation is performing, it's best to consider the following. For the three months ending November, which coincides with the end of our fiscal third quarter, estimated depletions or distributor sales to retail for Constellation's total U.S. wine and spirits business across all channels increased 3%. ", "Interestingly, this includes the on-premise channel, which has been slowly improving throughout the year and posted positive growth trends in the low single-digit range during the third quarter for Constellation and for the industry as well. More importantly, our focused brand group, which represents the majority of our U.S. wine profitability, posted depletion trends of almost 10% in the third quarter. ", "We are managing for cash and margin our other, more mature U.S. wine brands, many of which are in declining categories. Overall, consumer takeaway trends for our U.S. wine portfolio are generally aligned with industry trends across all channels in the mid-single-digit range. It is a combination of these and depletion trends that are indicative of the underlying health of our business.", "Additionally, although promotional spending on an industry wide basis appears to be abating slightly, it is a bit higher than last year and what we originally anticipated. During the third quarter Constellation Wines U.S. also progressed in efforts to improve cost, cash, and operational effectiveness with activities that included completion of the east coast winery consolidation effort, further consolidation of the California warehouse system, continued expansion of the solar energy initiative at several of our California facilities, and in addition to these accomplishments, we've recently received several accolades for our well-known portfolio of brands, the following of which are particularly noteworthy.", "Robert Mondavi's director of wine making, Genevieve Janssens, has received one of the industry's highest honors and was named 2010 Wine Star Winemaker of the Year by Wine Enthusiast magazine. Constellation also won eight Impact Blue Chip Brand Awards, more than any wine company has ever won in a single year. Our winning U.S. brands include Estancia, Blackstone, Clos du Bois, Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Woodbridge, Corona Light, Modelo Especial, and SVEDKA. ", "Wine and Spirits Magazine named Ravenswood as one of the top 100 wineries of the year and Joe Peterson, founder of Ravenswood, is being inducted into the Culinary Institute of America's Vintner's Hall of Fame in February.", "The accolades also continue for our Canadian business. At the International Wine and Spirits competition in London, Vincor achieved Gold and Best in Class wins for Inniskillin Wines' Niagara, the 2007 Cabernet Franc Icewine, and 2007 Sparkling Vidal Icewine. Jackson-Triggs Okanagan Estate 2007 Proprietors Grand Reserve Riesling Icewine, and 2007 Sunrock Vineyards Shiraz. And Jackson-Triggs Okanagan Estate was also awarded best Canadian producer.", "And moving on to SVEDKA and our spirits business, SVEDKA delivered strong year-to-date performance, posting double-digit sales and depletion growth. We continue to build SVEDKA's on-premise brand awareness by leveraging new distributor roots to market. We are growing our national accounts in on- and off-premise channels, and are expanding in other core markets outside the U.S. ", "Moving to Crown Imports, we previously reported during the third quarter we settled our legal dispute with Modelo relating to the calendar 2010 funding of marketing and promotional spending, which was incremental to that [inaudible] original Crown joint venture agreement. As part of this settlement, the partners decided on future funding levels for these same expenditures for calendar 2011, through the remainder of the term of the joint venture agreement, which requires that Crown pay for a percentage of the incremental funding going forward. This investment by Crown will ensure that the joint venture continues to have the world-class marketing and promotional programs that have made it the unrivaled leader in the U.S. imported beer category. ", "I would now like to move on to a discussion of Crown's operational results for the third quarter. During the third quarter, Crown worked closely with distributors to bring their inventories to more normal levels after experiencing supply chain disruptions this summer related to a combination of Hurricane Alex and a Modelo brewery strike in Mexico. ", "This effort, combined with the positive marketplace momentum that the Crown portfolio of products has experienced throughout the year, resulted in improved performance through the third quarter. During this timeframe, Crown outperformed the industry, the import category, and the other three major beer suppliers in the SymphonyIRI Food, Drug, Mass Merchant, and Convenience channels on a dollar sales basis.", "Among the four major suppliers, Crown was the only one to gain dollar and case volume market share. This is the third consecutive quarter that Crown posted positive depletion results, which increased in the mid-single-digit range, including positive depletion trends for Corona Extra.", "Based on Crown's year-to-date results, we are revising their depletion estimate upward for fiscal 2011 to growth in the low to mid-single-digit range with profits increasing low-single digits versus last year. Originally, Crown's estimated depletions were to be down slightly, with operating income declines in the mid-single-digit range. ", "Throughout the remainder of our fiscal 2011, we expect Crown to be focused on strong market execution, supported by new product introductions, package expansions, and solid promotional activities, which are planned for the balance of our fiscal year. Some examples include: Following the successful introduction of Modelo's Victoria beer brand in Chicago as an initial test market in June, Mexico's oldest beer was launched state-wide in Texas and in key Colorado markets in December. ", "Victoria is one of Mexico's most prestigious beer brands and is being introduced at a price point premium to Corona Extra, the brand that's scheduled for rollout in additional markets in early calendar 2011. Modelo Especial, one of the fastest-growing large beer brands, eclipsed yet-another major milestone by surpassing 30 million cases sold in the 12-month period through October. Since its U.S. introduction in the 1980s, Modelo Especial has risen through the ranks to become the number three imported beer and the number 15 ranked beer on a dollar sales basis in the total U.S. beer market.", "The Corona Extra \"Find Your Beach\" campaign was kicked off in September, and has been well received in the marketplace. It includes a TV spot called \"Moments\" that encourages consumers to find their beach wherever it may be. And Corona Light's national multimedia campaign continues to carve out a distinct personality for this brand. In fact, one measure of its success is the fact that the number of Facebook fans has increased from 3,000 to more than 200,000 in just two months.", "Before we turn the call over to Bob, I wanted to inform you that we have received notification by the majority shareholder of Ruffino of their exercise of its option to put its interest in Ruffino to Constellation. Prior to this notification, we had initiated proceedings against the majority shareholder questioning the validity of the put option. This action should take some time to resolve. ", "In closing, we continue to execute and make great progress in a number of areas. We have strong marketplace momentum for our U.S. wine and beer business, and the U.S. distributor transition is working well. I'm especially pleased that we have found a suitable buyer for our U.K. and Australia operations who we believe is committed to growing the business and providing a home for our dedicated employees in these markets. Collectively, these efforts reflect our diligent focus on achieving profitable organic growth.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Bob for our financial discussion of our third quarter business results.", "Bob Ryder", "Thanks Bob. Good morning everyone. Q3 comparable basis diluted EPS came in at $0.66 versus $0.54 last year, as we saw improvement in interest expense and tax favorability versus the prior-year quarter. The third quarter also marks pretty significant progress in our strategy to drive profitable organic growth: improve the flow through of EBITDA to free cash flow and enhance the financial profile of the company. ", "Efforts to strengthen our organic business model under our new U.S. business structure and consolidated U.S. distributor network continue to progress. These efforts have helped to drive continued positive depletion, retail, and mix trends for our U.S. wine business. ", "Our increased focus on improving free cash flow generation continues to drive benefits. This is demonstrated by our very strong free cash flow performance during the first nine months of fiscal 2011 and our improved visibility to future cash flow generation. As a result, we're increasing our full-year cash flow target by $100 million to a new range of $475 million to $525 million. ", "In addition to reducing interest costs, cash, taxes, and restructuring costs, we continue to make progress in reducing our network and capital investment and we believe this new level of free cash flow is sustainable on a longer-term basis. This will be a new record of free cash flow generation at Constellation, and we are pleased with our results. Many dedicated people, from grape buyers to wine makers, throughout the company, are thinking in new ways to generate better financial returns from our business. ", "We completed our accelerated stock buyback transaction during the quarter. Under this transaction we paid $300 million in April 2010 and received 17.2 million shares for an average cost of $17.42 a share. 13.8 million of the shares were received in the first quarter, and the remaining 3.4 million shares came in on November 30.", "We estimate the transaction will generate about $0.09 of diluted earnings per share accretion in fiscal 2011, and this has been reflected in our guidance since the first quarter. We also delisted from the Australia Securities Exchange during the quarter, which helped us eliminate the cost and administrative burden associated with that listing. ", "As Rob noted, we've reached an agreement to sell our Australian and U.K. business. The transaction is valued at $290 million Australian dollars, and should close by the end of January. We will retain 20% of this business. We expect proceeds of about $230 million, which will be used to reduce borrowings.", "With interest and cost savings, we expect the transaction to be neutral to slightly dilutive to comparable basis EPS for fiscal 2012. More importantly, this transaction is aligned with our strategy to premiumize the business and improve the financial profile of the company. Our consolidated comparable basis gross profit and operating margins should improve by about 400 to 500 basis points, and our earnings should be less volatile and we'll have much lower exposure to foreign currency swings. Without this lower return business, our ROIC metrics will also be enhanced.", "Now let's look at our fiscal Q3 P&L performance in more detail, though my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our news release, consolidated reported net sales decreased 2%, primarily due to the divestiture of our U.K. cider business. Excluding the cider sale and impact of currency, net sales were level with the prior-year quarter.", "My commentary for the following net sales comparisons will be on a constant currency basis. North America wine net sales were even with the prior year, and reflected favorable product mix, offset by a decrease in U.S. shipment volume as the number of distributors under shipment commitments were less than a year ago. ", "Australia and Europe sales decreased 1%. Spirits organic net sales increased 8% for the quarter, with SVEDKA leading the way with a 34% growth rate. It continues to maintain strong momentum in the marketplace, with sales and depletions growing double digits on a fiscal year-to-date basis.", "Now let's look at our profits on a comparable basis. For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 36.5% versus 35.4% for the prior year. This primarily reflects product mix benefits. U.S. promotion expense on a dollar basis was roughly even with the prior year, as we increased promotion spending in the back half of last year, following the implementation of the new distributor contracts, which commenced in September 2009. An increase in U.S. freight costs from the higher-cost calendar 2008 red grape harvest were offset by grape cost benefits in Australia. ", "Our consolidated SG&A for the quarter increased $19 million and came in at 18.3% of net sales compared with 15.9% a year ago. This reflects incremental investments in technology around Project Fusion activities, some year-over-year incentive compensation variances, and an increase in marketing and selling expenses. Consolidated operating income decreased 8% to $176 million, and operating margin decreased 1.2% to 18.2%.", "I'd now like to turn to our segment operating income results and provide highlights of our third quarter operating income [inaudible]. North America segment operating income decreased $18 million to $193 million. Improved sales mix in the current year's quarter was more than offset by higher grape costs, investments in technology, marketing and selling, and higher incentive compensation costs. The Australian and Europe wine segment reported operating income of $9 million, a $2 million increase versus the prior-year quarter. The increase was mostly due to grape cost benefits in Australia.", "Corporate and other expenses totaled $26 million versus $27 million for the prior-year quarter. Consolidated equity earnings totaled $71 million versus $60 million last year. Equity earnings for Crown totaled $58 million versus $46 million for the prior-year quarter. The remainder of equity earnings in Q3 fiscal 2011 and Q3 fiscal 2010 are primarily generated by Opus One.", "In the quarter, Crown generated net sales of $612 million, an increase of 22%, and operating income of $116 million, an increase of 27%. As Rob mentioned, sales and operating income primarily benefitted from volume growth as wholesaler inventories returned to more optimal levels following very low Q2 inventories resulting from supply chain issues experienced during the summer.", "Crown's operating results also benefitted from lower promotional spending, but were unfavorably impacted by a legal arbitration decision regarding a former distributor and the contractual cost increase for Modelo products. As Rob mentioned, we now expect Crown to deliver growth in sales and depletions and a slight increase in operating income for fiscal 2011.", "Interest expense for the quarter was $49 million, down 25% versus last year. The decrease was primarily driven by a lower average interest rate and reduced debt levels during the quarter. Our average interest rate for the quarter was a little above 5%.", "Let's take a look at our debt position. At the end of November, our debt totaled $3.7 billion. This represents a $109 million decrease from our debt level at the end of fiscal 2010. This decrease is impressive given the funding of our $300 million stock buyback earlier in the year. Our debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio at the end of November was 4.3 times. ", "With our increased free cash flow guidance, and expected proceeds from the sale of the Australian and U.K. business, we're targeting to be around the high 3 times range by the end of fiscal 2011. Our comparable-basis effective tax rate benefitted from the favorable outcome of certain tax items and came in at 29%. This compares to a 35% rage for Q3 last year. Given the favorable run rate for the first nine months of the year, we're now targeting a full-year tax rate of 31%.", "Now let's discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities, less cap ex. For the nine months of fiscal 2011, we generated free cash flow of $299 million versus $100 million for the same period last year. This improvement reflects lower interest, tax, and restructuring payments. We saw a sizable source of cash resulting from the reduction of inventory. There was also an increased use of cash from accounts receivable due to the timing of sales in the quarter.", "Cap ex came in at $70 million versus $89 million for the first nine months of last year. As mentioned earlier, we're now targeting free cash flow for fiscal 2011 in the $475 million to $525 million range. This includes cap ex in the region of $100 million to $120 million, a $10 million reduction from our previous projection.", "Now let's move to our full-year fiscal 2011 P&L outlook. We are tightening our range and increasing our comparable basis EPS guidance to $1.80 to $1.85 from our previous range of $1.63 to $1.78 per share. This increase is primarily driven by the improvement of our targeted tax rate, which I discussed earlier.", "The tax rate improvement represents about $0.10 of benefit per share. Please remember that in Q4 of last year, we reduced distributor inventories, so our FY11 Q4 EBIT should look very positive to the previous year. Our full-year EBIT is essentially on our guidance, as the beer upside is being reinvested in U.S. wine promotion spending.", "We now expect interest expense to be in the range of $195 million to $200 million, and weighted average diluted shares to be about $214 million. Our comparable basis EPS guidance excludes restructuring charges and unusual items, which are detailed in our news release.", "Consistent with the past few years, we intend to provide next year's detailed financial guidance after we finalize our plan, and in connection with our fourth quarter press release and conference call, which is scheduled for early April. However, given our earlier discussion, I would like to frame in a couple of potential impacts to FY12 for you.", "As highlighted by Rob, while we are pleased with our underlying U.S. depletion trends, our contracts with newly appointed distributors require specified product purchase levels. This will result in shipments exceeding depletions during fiscal 2011. All product purchase requirements will have expired as of the end of fiscal 2011. ", "Going forward, shipments should align with depletions through the balance of the contracts on an annual basis. As we overlap the FY11 shipment commitments in FY12, we will face a difficult comparison, and as a result we currently anticipate nominal EBIT growth for our U.S. wine business in fiscal 2012.", "Rob outlined the incremental marketing and promotional funding by Crown going forward. This is expected to inhibit operating earnings growth in FY12. However, we expect slightly lower interest expense and a continued low comparable tax rate due to additional anticipated tax outcomes. ", "Given the factors just mentioned, directionally we currently anticipate comparable basis diluted EPS for FY12 to be slightly above FY11 guidance. As mentioned earlier, we feel the improvements we have made in generating free cash flow are sustainable and we currently estimate that free cash flow in FY12 will be at least in line with that in FY11. ", "With that level of free cash flow, [rough map] would indicate a comparable EBITDA leverage ratio in the low 3 times range by the end of fiscal 2012. That will be towards the lower end of our targeted leverage ratio, and we have not ruled out future stock buybacks.", "Before we take your questions, I would like to note that our simplified U.S. organizational structure, streamlined brand portfolio, and consolidated U.S. distributor network have contributed to improved depletion volumes and marketplace performance versus last year. Promotion spending has not yet abated in the U.S. wine category, and we will need to keep an eye on market spending rates. ", "In the beer business, we continue seeing positive depletion and retail results from Crown's branding and marketing initiatives. The sale of our Australian and U.K. business will result in a dramatic improvement to most financial metrics. Although the business constituted roughly a quarter of our net sales, it contributed very little of the profits. ", "Our free cash flow generation profile has improved dramatically, and we are on track to produce an all-time high free cash flow result for the year, and we anticipate that level of free cash flow in future years. This will provide opportunities for further deleveraging of stock buybacks.", "With that, we're happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions.] Your first question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala of UBS.", "Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS", "On these noncore brands, they're a small piece in terms of your profit but a good piece of your volume. Can you talk about what you're doing there to see if you can get trends to stabilize on some of those noncore wine assets?", "Rob Sands", "You're talking about our noncore brands?", "Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS", "Yes, outside of the 15 or 17 focused brands.", "Rob Sands", "There's about 17 focused brands, and then we have other categories which we describe as either tactical or protect and defend. The object is not really to stabilize those particular brands, and as I said in my talk our focus is really to operate those brands with a focus on margins and cash flow. That will continue to be our focus for those brands.", "Bob Ryder", "There in, like, eroding categories, but they have very good financial profile, so you can't really turn them around on growth, but we're trying to sell as much as we can because they have very good financial metrics.", "Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS", "And then in talking about your fiscal 2012, it sounds like depletion should be ahead of shipments. Are you willing to give some sort of estimate on what you're expecting for the depletion in fiscal 2012?", "Rob Sands", "In our next fiscal year we expect depletions and shipments to be essentially equal.", "Bob Ryder", "So this gets a little confusing. The shipments, absent shipments and depletions, will be relatively aligned, but because of FY11, the base - when you do a growth calculation depletions will grow faster than shipments, but we'll ship in absolute numbers about the same number of cases as will be depleted, if that makes sense.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.", "Judy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "First, just from a big picture perspective, obviously you guys have been focusing on at least pacing your volume in line with the category growth in the U.S. wine business. It looks like the category, I think you said is growing at a mid-single-digit rate. Your depletions are up about 2%. I know there's some drag in terms of these noncore brands, but can you just give us some big-picture comment about how you think you're performing in terms of the market performance, especially in light of the heightened promotional environment that you continue to see in the marketplace as well as your stepped-up spending to gain some of that share in the market?", "Rob Sands", "I think our performance is actually pretty good. You quoted the 2% depletion in the third quarter, and that's only for the quarter. For the whole year our depletion growth has been in excess of that, and very much in line with the marketplace. As you also mentioned, yes, there is some drag on that depletion growth as a result of how we operate our noncore brands. But when we really look at our core brands, which is the vast majority, vast vast majority, of our profitability in only 17 brands, as I said we had about 10% depletion growth in the third quarter, and I think that that's really indicative of the strength of the business, and I think is really the critical thing in looking at how we're performing relative to the marketplace. And that performance is well in excess of industry growth rates, so we're pretty pleased about that.", "Judy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And then just a little bit more color in terms of the promotional environment. Are you looking at certain price segments or certain channels, or certain brands that are being a little bit more aggressive here? What is your strategy to tackle that situation going forward as you relate to more price discounts, or new products, innovation, marketing, and so forth.", "Rob Sands", "We're looking at that very carefully. I would characterize the current environment as promotional activity in general being slightly higher than it has been in the past, or let me say versus last year. Our promotional activity similarly has been at the higher level, but we're balancing that out, in fact, by being judicious in the way that we promote our noncore brands versus how we promote our core brands, meaning we're investing more in promoting our core brands than in our noncore brands to balance our overall promotional activity. That's part of our strategy of how we're dealing with this to make sure that it stays within our own expectations. ", "In the future, our total strategy around driving profitable organic growth is all about brand-building, and brand-building is really all about having brands that are strong enough to not have the degree of price sensitivity that more commodicized brands have, so that they don't have to be promoted to an extent greater than we think is necessary. So that's how we're thinking about all of this, and a lot of our activities around how we're marketing our brands and advertising our brands and the new products and line extensions that we're developing, is all about our brand-building efforts.", "Judy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And then Bob, just in terms of that mismatch between shipments and depletions, a few questions there. One is how does that play out in the fourth quarter, because last year you had a pretty significant destocking. So I'm wondering if you're going to now benefit from a shipment perspective in the fourth quarter. Two, the 40% of the distributors that are not under the new distribution agreements, how is their inventory level right now. And then finally, I guess the understanding in terms of fiscal '12 shipments and depletions now matching going forward, does that suggest basically the distributors that are under the new agreements will carry higher inventory than they have previously?", "Bob Ryder", "So your comment on Q4 is correct. I tried to indicate that a little bit in my script. Your recollection is correct, we did reduce distributor inventories last year in the fourth quarter in return for some distributor investments in our brands. We thought that was a pretty good tradeoff. So in the fourth quarter you should see pretty healthy sales and EBIT growth in the North American wine and spirit category. So that would be correct. And for the full year, our EBIT should be pretty well aligned with the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year and actually might be slightly higher than what you guys think on average. So that's the Q4 comment.", "On the other distributors, meaning the distributors that were not converted to a consolidated distributor system, that's been business as usual. So ships have pretty much equaled depletes all along. There's not been a lot of action there.", "And as far as FY12, again you are correct. The way we distribute our contracts, or agree to, was that there was this initial period of shipment guarantees and the day those shipment guarantees end the inventory on that day stays with the distributors through the end of the contract. So it does get a bit confusing. So as of the end of this year, those shipment guarantees end, so next year we expect in general shipments to equal depletions. However, as you do a growth calculation, the sales growth will be less than the depletion growth, simply because of the respective denominators.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Vivien Azer of Citi.", "Vivien Azer \u2013 Citigroup", "I'm just wondering, with respect to your distributors is there a difference in the product mix that they're selling, i.e. that the five distributors that have 60% of your volume do they skew more to your focus brands or is it pretty much even across your distribution system?", "Rob Sands", "No, there's not really a difference in - I mean there's differences in makes and markets and in distributors in general, but as a general proposition there's no difference in mix in the distributors that have contracts versus those that don't. We as a company are very focused on mix, and driving the mix towards our core brands, which are higher margin, higher gross profit as a general proposition, and that gives us the opportunity not only for depletion growth but also for a positive mix effect. So that's what we try to do in general across all our markets, but there isn't a huge difference or there's nothing peculiar about mix in distributors with contracts versus those that don't have contracts.", "Vivien Azer \u2013 Citigroup", "The reason I asked is while I understand that there is a difference between the depletions and the shipments from a growth perspective and how that's going to impact FY12. I guess I'm still kind of surprised because you're putting up such good depletion growth for your higher margin brands that that's not going to show up any more in EBIT than what you've indicated for FY12.", "Rob Sands", "That also emanates from the fact that the shipment guarantees that were in place this year also took into account mix, and therefore shipments next year will be at a similar mix level as this year because we're comparing shipments not depletions. Whereas, as to what we're doing in the market place it's all about driving depletions for future growth and for future mix benefits. I'm sorry that this is as confusing as it is, but it's shipments versus shipments from a financial point of view but from an underlying growth perspective it's depletions versus depletions, year-over-year.", "Bob Ryder", "And what we have seen, in the market and IRI, we have seen positive mix shift. The whole market has seen positive mix shifts. We don't anticipate that changing dramatically next year, but the gravity is basically just overlapping the fact that shipments exceeded depletions in fiscal '11.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Lauren Torres of HSBC.", "Lauren Torres \u2013 HSBC", "My question is on the beer business. You're benefitting, and we're seeing some upside here as a result of easy comps. Also, coming back from some of these supply chain challenges. But with that said, I'm just curious about the actual health of the beer business, whether it be on-premise trends, also maybe with your competitors taking some pricing, how the narrowing of that price gap is helping your numbers. Once again, just an overall sense of how these trends are improving ex the comps and ex some of these supply chain challenges.", "Rob Sands", "Our beer business, Crown, is, I would say, particularly healthy at the moment. As you know, we increased our guidance on what we expected on depletions this year, for the total year, to the low to mid-single-digit levels. In the third quarter we actually experienced very solid mid-single depletion growth, up approximately 5%, and year-to-date depletions are running also in the mid-single digits. So I think that's indicative of a very healthy beer business. ", "Imports in general are outperforming the total beer business, the domestic beer business. Crown is outperforming the other three major suppliers. As it relates to our specific brands, we probably have, in terms of scale brands, we have the hottest brand in the marketplace with Modelo Especial, which is now the third largest import, as I said. It's now the 15th largest beer overall. On a dollar sales basis, it's the third-largest import. It's in excess of 30 million cases. And it's got very strong growth. ", "Corona Extra has returned back to growth. So as I've said in the past, the beer business has proved to be one of the most cyclical parts of our business and the silver lining in that cloud is that as the economy continues to recover I think that the Crown business is going to continue to improve as well. So in general, we're really pleased with how Crown is performing and how that business is doing from an underlying depletion trend point of view.", "Lauren Torres \u2013 HSBC", "And just with respect to the relationship, obviously now that the litigation is out of the way, does that open more avenues to kind of grow your brands and open up discussions between the two? Has that changed at all?", "Rob Sands", "Well, the relationship is good, and the consequence of how we resolved that matter was an agreement relative to incremental spending against the brand for marketing and promotion. And I think that that's playing out well. We've got great programs in place and I think that those programs are driving some of our results, our very positive results, really because I think that our marketing programs and advertising is truly a cut above really anything else in the industry in a lot of ways. ", "I think that our execution is fantastic, and I think that more importantly, our brand, we have delivered a very consistent message relative to Corona Extra and our brand, which has resonated with the consumer. As opposed to, I think, some of the herky jerky marketing programs and activities of some of the competitors, which I don't think has worked to their benefit. And it's hard to repair because the consistency hasn't been there for the number of years that it has been for Corona Extra in particular.", "Lauren Torres \u2013 HSBC", "And lastly, can I Bob, the cap ex guidance for this year now is $100 million to $120 million? Is that what you said?", "Bob Ryder", "Correct.", "Lauren Torres \u2013 HSBC", "So that would imply $30 million to $50 million in the fourth quarter. Just wondering why that seems a bit high relative to the last couple of quarters?", "Bob Ryder", "You know, if you've spent as much time with engineers as I have, they like to kind of wait until the fourth quarter to spend all their cap ex. Every company I've been at. So it's all like year-over-year timing stuff.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.", "Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley", "Bob, what tax rate are you assuming in the 2012 earnings guidance range you gave us? Comparable tax rate?", "Bob Ryder", "Good question. I expected a lot of tax questions. We're not giving a specific rate right now. We will on the April call, but what we're saying is the rate will not be above the rate guidance for this year, which is about 31%. So you shouldn't expect any tax rate in FY12 above 31%.", "Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley", "I assume that's not an ongoing tax rate, and what kind of range do you think your ongoing long-term tax rate is? Does that include some one-time benefits next year?", "Bob Ryder", "We generally don't give longer-term guidance, but we have, and it kind of sorted out a little bit last year, more this year, and we expect some of it in future years, some relatively positive outcomes with some tax jurisdictions we have around the world. So we're seeing that flow through a lower effective tax rate, and you also see some lower cash tax payments as well, so we're very happy with our tax rates and we think that's why we can say this year will be a low rate and next year will be a low rate. But when the dust settles, and this could be a number of years out, if we're just a North American business, generally in the U.S. tax rates are higher than anywhere else in the world. So I wouldn't assume that we're going to have a 31% tax rate for like a 12-year duration, but I think we'll have some positive tax outcomes for the relative near future.", "Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley", "And then Rob, you commented promotional levels in wine were worse than you expected. Can you give us more detail there? Is it a significant gap? And it sounds like you'll be matching that with higher than expected promotional levels on your part than you originally expected?", "Rob Sands", "I said that they're a little higher than perhaps we had expected. I wouldn't say that it's anything particularly outstanding. Our promotional levels have been higher throughout the year, but we've also had the benefit of that in our depletion trends and we don't expect anything outside of our communicated expectations for the remainder of the year. So we expect them to continue to remain moderately higher than they have in the past, but at this stage not beyond our expectations, and it's baked into all of our thinking and our guidance for the year, so that's where we're at.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Nicolaus.", "Mark Swartzberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "A few questions, but staying here on wine, the promotional spending being a little bit higher in the quarter than expected, a little higher in the coming quarter than expected. I wonder if we could kind of step back a little bit here. And the game plan here circa summer of 2009, I guess, was to do things that are going to allow you to improve share and we're yet to see that happening. And the spending is going to be greater than what you had anticipated. So sometimes these things take longer than anticipated, but can you just kind of give us a state of the union in terms of what you think from a one-year, two-year, three-year timeframe from here. Do you think there's going to be the things that are going to allow you to actually deliver on that hope of indeed being a share taker without dollars being the only driver of that?", "Rob Sands", "Yeah, when you're looking at the longer range, the thing that we're trying to accomplish as I said is all about the underlying depletion growth. And we've established some pretty good trends in our underlying depletion growth as it relates to both actual percentage growth and mix, meaning that if you look at our depletion mix, in terms of dollar sales of depletions, it would be significantly ahead of our actual physical case growth. Therefore, as we move into periods next year and the year after and so on and so forth where the depletions equal shipments and we don't have this overlap and the imbalance issue, and we won't. That's going to bode very well for our underlying growth, and let me put it this way, as that starts to flow through to sales, we ought to be able to leverage that throughout the P&L to a positive net income result.", "Mark Swartzberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "So you feel like it's early innings - I guess I'm still struggling, but okay. Fair enough. As we look at the contract you have with these larger distributors and that 60% of volume, can you remind us what the duration on them is, how much time is left on them? And then if we think, and I realize there's confidentiality here, but if we think from their perspective in terms of early termination rights, are there share objectives that have to be achieved? Are there certain absolute rates of depletion growth? Can you talk a little bit about what rights they have it there comes a point where they're not happy with the relationship?", "Rob Sands", "Contracts generally run for about 5.5 years from our fiscal 2010 and [inaudible] includes fiscal 2010. So partially through '15, fiscal year '15. ", "Mark Swartzberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "And any thoughts on early termination or performance provisions that would make it earlier?", "Rob Sands", "No. There's generally, related to performance, no early termination. In fact, it's the opposite, in that there are incentives and disincentives in the contracts for distributor performance, meaning if distributors overperform there's incentives for them. If they underperform there's disincentives for them. But there's not early termination so to speak.", "Mark Swartzberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "And then just shifting over to the Ruffino comment, can you just - I realize it's a dispute, but from Ruffino's perspective what kind of number are we talking about in terms of the put they're trying to implement here?", "Bob Ryder", "It was in last year's Q and there will be a little bit more verbiage in this quarter's Q as in last quarter's Q. The maximum amount of the put is EUR55 million. We're disputing the put in total. But under SEC regs we have to disclose the maximum amount of the put, so that's EUR55 million. ", "Mark Swartzberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "And Bob, also on the tax rate, can you talk a little bit more, kind of flesh it out a little bit more in terms of what's driving this improvement? It seems like you think it will be multi-year in nature. Can you talk in a little bit more detail about what is the source of these improvements?", "Bob Ryder", "In the tax world, it gets so complicated. And the other thing is there's these big time lags between, you know, when the original tax return was filed and when the ultimate settlement happens that we'd rather not talk about specifics.", "Mark Swartzberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "And then last one, over on beer, can you give us some sense of how December was? Obviously weather was an issue, but the industry, or at least your business, picked up nicely in the quarter, your quarter. Can you talk about December?", "Bob Ryder", "I don't know if we can talk about December specifically, but right now both us and the Crown business are very happy with the momentum that our beer business has. In the third quarter, Corona Extra, as Rob had mentioned, actually registered positive growth, which is the first time since the JV was formed, so we're very happy about that. We think that's some of our nice marketing, and we've done some restructuring in our sales organization, so we think our execution is getting a little bit better there. And we remain quite bullish on Modelo Especial, which you know as Rob said, is at 30 million cases, and it's still growing at 15-20%. It's pretty amazing. And we're very bullish, although very early days, on the launch of Victoria. We're bringing it into new states next year, so we expect pretty good things from that brand, which also has a high deal of brand equity and resonates pretty immediately with, especially the Hispanic community, but we think it could even have legs beyond that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Timothy Ramey of D.A. Davidson.", "Tim Ramey \u2013 D.A. Davidson", "Just as we think about the target inventory levels before the end of the fourth quarter, the idea of freezing them, are there levers that the distributors can pull in terms of incremental promotion to kind of work those down since there, I assume, would be a multi-year incentive for them to do extra-well this quarter.", "Rob Sands", "To work what down?", "Tim Ramey \u2013 D.A. Davidson", "Their distributor inventory.", "Rob Sands", "Yeah, there are some mechanisms in the contract that the distributors can utilize to pull down inventory through overperformance, yes.", "Tim Ramey \u2013 D.A. Davidson", "Does any of that require copayment along with you, or co-investment, or how does that work?", "Rob Sands", "That's up to them how they generate the performance other than they can't generate performance in a manner that's not to the benefit of the brand. But they can increase their investment against the brand to drive growth as long as it's done in a manner that's consistent with the brand health.", "Bob Ryder", "And they can't, irrespective of what they do, they can't force us to do anything that we do not want to do, so we're kind of independent. So they can spend more promotion out of their pocket if they want, but it has to be consistent with what we both agree is the brand equity. And no matter what they do, they cannot force us to follow them.", "Tim Ramey \u2013 D.A. Davidson", "So in general, the fourth quarter performance could be both organically and optically a little better than what -", "Bob Ryder", "Well, fourth quarter, again, on a year-over-year basis, we're overlapping the fact that we took inventories down last year, so that will make both sales and EBIT growth look pretty robust in the fourth quarter, but that's mostly a prior-year overlap issue. Normally, the third quarter is the Christmas build. Everybody builds inventory in the third quarter. The normal cadence would be for the fourth quarter for depletions to actually exceed shipments as that Christmas inventory kind of gets [inaudible].", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Christine Farkas of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Christine Farkas \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "I had a question on Australia and grapes if I could. One of the beautiful things about the global structure of Constellation is your ability to source globally, and I'm just wondering if the sale of the Australian operations will change that ability to act as to or source the [inaudible] from Australia to use in some of your operations.", "Rob Sands", "Nope. Doesn't change that. In fact, it gives us more flexibility over the longer range than less flexibility, because we're not tied any further to the bricks and mortars of our own operations and therefore if there are supply imbalances or oversupply around the world in various appellations, whether it's Australia or otherwise, we can take advantage of that and take advantage of favorable pricing trends to buy bulk wine if that's what we decide to do, from other operation. Whereas obviously if you've got your own vineyard, plants, etc. your first instinct would be to utilize your own production regardless of how that matches up with other opportunities that are available in the marketplace. Or advantageous situations. ", "Christine Farkas \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Then if the reverse were true, if there was a shortage, that's where your scale would potentially come into advantage as well?", "Rob Sands", "You could say that, but there's no shortages anticipated in the near future on a worldwide basis, and we certainly have sufficient production capabilities in the rest of the business overall to meet any demand needs that we think could be foreseeable as well as the ability to move or switch appellations in brand, certain brands, where it's appropriate, as we need to do. So we don't anticipate any issue in that regard in any timeframe that would be of concern to any of us, you or I.", "Christine Farkas \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And then just to round out on grapes, you did mention or highlight grape costs as a source of pressure on gross margins. I'm wondering if you could just highlight for us where we are in that inventory. Is this high-cost inventory going to run through for the next few quarters, or are we at the end of that? Just kind of frame how that inventory situation is working out. ", "Bob Ryder", "In the U.S. the harvest year '08 was a relatively expensive harvest, and that is flushing through cost of goods sold this year, which is making the fiscal '11 COGS look higher than fiscal '10. We expect most of that to flush through this year. There might be a tiny amount in next year, but it probably won't be noticeable. So that should be behind us. The opposite is happening on the Australia COGS, where last year they flushed through more expensive grapes in fiscal '10 than we are seeing in fiscal '11, but of course that won't be much more of a concern to us on a consolidated basis. It will only be a concern for our 20% equity interest in the new entity.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Carlos Laboy of Credit Suisse.", "Carlos Laboy - Credit Suisse", "Rob, how do you gauge, or what is the danger, that these line distributors build excessive inventories to meet these distribution commitments? And if it does happen, what do you do about it? How do you go about it?", "Rob Sands", "Well, first of all, the distributors don't have excessive inventories, and the shipment guarantees are over, and so on average those distributors with shipment guarantees are running about 2-3 months of inventory, which is pretty standard in the industry. So if anything, you might argue that inventory levels are where we want them - that's we, meaning us, the supplier. Distributors would always like to have lower inventories to higher inventories. And since the shipment guarantees are over, in one case halfway through this fiscal year and the rest of the cases at the end of the fiscal year, and then under the agreement shipments have to equal depletes, those inventory levels in terms of number of cases will remain where they are. Now, they'll come down as the business grows, or if the business grows let me say, which of course we expect that it will, but they'll come down in a number of days as the business grows thereafter.", "Carlos Laboy - Credit Suisse", "And to close out with a beer question, Rob, would you buy back the other 50% of Crown if you could? And what keeps you from asking for it?", "Rob Sands", "My answer to that is I really can't comment on that. We have no intention at the current time of buying back the other 50% interest in Crown. I did see what you wrote in Beer Business Daily, by the way, or your quote in Beer Business Daily. But obviously that's your own speculation and we as I said really have no plans that we can comment on.", "Operator", "That was your final question. I'll now turn the call back over to Rob Sands for closing remarks.", "Rob Sands", "Well thank you everybody for joining our call today. I am pleased with our third quarter, and would like to summarize the highlights as follows. Number one, we did generate very strong free cash flow, which has enabled us to not only fund our share buyback, but has allowed us to continue our debt reduction efforts. We increased our free cash flow target for the year and believe it is sustainable for the longer term. We are experiencing strong momentum in our imported beer business, and marketplace trends for our U.S. wine and spirits business are healthy and our U.S. distributor initiative is working. Our plan is to continue solid execution of our initiatives throughout the final quarter of the year.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Patty Yahn-Urlaub", "Thank you, Jackie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Constellation's Third Quarter Fiscal 2012 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer.", "This call complements our news release, which has also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP, comparable, organic and constant-currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com under the Investors section and Financial History.", "Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call.

I hope you all had a great holiday and the opportunity to enjoy some of our fine products throughout the season. Welcome to our discussion of Constellation's Third Quarter Fiscal 2012 Sales and Earnings Results. ", "We continue to progress through the year with results that are generally in line with our expectations for most areas of the business. I'm especially pleased with our significantly improved consolidated margin structure and our continued progress in the area of free cash flow generation, which has essentially enabled us to fund our share repurchase efforts where we have already completed more than 50% of our current authorization.", "Our top line performance for the quarter was not surprising, as we continue to lap last year's third quarter U.S. distributor inventory build. As a reminder, our shipments to distributors last year exceeded distributors\u2019 sales to retail as part of our U.S. distributor transition initiative. This had the effect of benefiting our sales and profits for fiscal 2011, but created a sales and EBIT comparison challenge for fiscal 2012.", "Now despite these sales trends, our U.S. Wine & Spirits depletions improved sequentially during the third quarter, with the entire portfolio growing almost 2% and focused brands growing about 6%. As previously discussed, we expected our depletion trends to improve as we progressed through the year due to the gating of the promotional spend for our U.S. Wine & Spirits businesses.", "This year, we are driving enhanced promotional and merchandising activity in the second half to better align with the seasonality of our business. As such, you can see in the IRI data, coinciding with our third quarter, that we gained volume share for total table wine and the Premium Plus segment, which represents the greater-than-$5 retail price point. This channel accounts for about 35% of our business. And our spirits sales remain robust as we gain share driven by our SVEDKA Vodka brand.", "However, growth for our total U.S. wine portfolio continues to lag that of the overall U.S. wine category on a year-to-date basis through the third quarter. Our U.S. wine share loss for this time period can be primarily attributed to a decline in value brands below the $5 retail price point as we increased net prices for some of our higher volume value brands such as Vendange and Arbor Mist. As would be expected, this action negatively impacted volumes, but to a bit greater degree than we originally anticipated.", "So what are we doing about this market share issue? We are in the process of revamping up innovation and new product development where we currently have more than 20 new product launches underway in fiscal 2012, many of which are included in hot categories that are experiencing significant growth. We currently have strong momentum for many of our newly launched products like Primal Roots Sweet Red Blend, Rex Goliath Moscato, Ruffino Prosecco, Woodbridge Malbec and the Simply Naked unoaked line of varietals. Our most recent introduction to the new product lineup is The Dreaming Tree brand, a collaboration between Steve Reeder, our award-winning winemaker at Simi, and acclaimed musician Dave Matthews, that is receiving rave reviews.", "This collection of new products is gaining traction and performed very well in the marketplace during the holiday selling season. And next year in fiscal 2013, we expect to have an increasing percentage of our sales growth coming from innovation. As I mentioned earlier, from a depletion perspective, during the third quarter our focus brands grew almost 6%, with several brands growing double digits, including SVEDKA Vodka, Black Box, Rex Goliath and Kim Crawford, just to name a few. However, the previously mentioned price increase on Arbor Mist has reduced our focus brands growth rate somewhat. To mitigate this, we have introduced Arbor Mist Pomegranate Berry Pinot Noir, which is doing very well in the marketplace, and we recently launched Arbor Mist Strawberry Moscato at Wal-Mart. This new flavor extension has exceeded all initial launch expectations.", "Next month, we are introducing Arbor Mist frozen wine cocktails at Wal-Mart in order to capitalize on one of the fastest-growing segments in beverage alcohol. We have other initiatives underway to drive some of our key focus brands. They include our recent relaunch of the Ravenswood brand with new labeling and a refinement of the Ravenswood blend to produce a more fruit-forward taste profile. Ravenswood is a great turnaround story, with recent SymphonyIRI trend showing mid-single digit volume growth rates during the third quarter. ", "For Blackstone, we have new packaging in the works and 2 new line extensions. A red blend was introduced last fall, and we will be rolling out a Malbec in the New Year. One of the things which I am particularly proud is the string of awards and accolades that we continue to receive for many of our focus brands from several industry-leading publications. They include the following: in the December 31 issue of Wine Spectator, the 2008 Robert Mondavi Oakville Cabernet Sauvignon was named one of the Top 100 Wines of 2011. Wine Spectator also awarded the 2008 Robert Mondavi Napa Valley Reserve Chardonnay 93 points, while the 2009 Robert Mondavi Napa Valley Reserve Pinot Noir was awarded a 91-point score. The Franciscan Cabernet Sauvignon 2007 was named to the Wine Enthusiast Top 100 of 2011 list. And the Inniskillin 2007 Vidal Icewine received 92 points from the wine enthusiasts and 95 points from the tasting panel. Five of our brands made wine.com's Top 100 list for 2011, including varietals from Franciscan, Robert Mondavi, Ravenswood, Ruffino and Kim Crawford. Finally, IMPACT Blue Chip awards were given to Clos du Bois, Estancia, Robert Mondavi Private Selection and SVEDKA. ", "Overall, we are catching up with industry trends in addressing some of the short-term challenges we face within our portfolio of brands. As you can see, we have several initiatives underway, and I believe we are firing on all cylinders from an innovation and new product development perspective. ", "While our recent trends are improving, we are tracking a bit short of our goal of growing in line with the U.S. wine category growth for the year due primarily to our tactical decision earlier this year to take pricing in the value segment. However, we remain focused on achieving this goal and we are strongly committed to this as one of our strategic objectives in driving profitable organic growth over the long term.", "Moving to SVEDKA Vodka. During the quarter, SVEDKA posted double-digit sales depletion and consumer takeaway trends in addition to gaining share in the vodka category IRI channels. In advance of the holiday selling season, SVEDKA launched its first-ever limited edition party bottle package in the marketplace. This was accompanied by a multichannel marketing campaign, including mobile and social media applications. ", "Now moving to the Crown Imports joint venture. As expected, Crown faced a difficult third quarter sales and earnings comparison versus last year when sales increased 22% driven by the rebuild of wholesaler inventories to more affable [ph] levels after Crown experienced supply-chain disruptions in the summer of calendar 2010. Despite these comparison issues, the Crown business remains very healthy, with depletions growing mid-single digits during the third quarter driven by Modelo Especial, Victoria and Corona Familiar. In addition, Crown continues to experience strong consumer demand resulting from the combined success of a number of promotional and marketing initiatives, including the Corona Extra \"Find Your Beach\" campaign and additional advertising investments during the NFL season.", "According to SymphonyIRI retail data, coinciding with the end of our third quarter, Crown continues to outperform the total U.S. beer industry, the import category and the other 3 major beer suppliers in both case and dollar sales trends in the food, drug, mass and convenience channels. And Crown is also the only major supplier to gain industry dollar share or case share. ", "Throughout calendar 2011, Crown achieved several milestones and has received recognition from some of the most notable beer and marketing channels in the industry, including the following. This is the first year that Crown Imports has been named to Advertising Age's prestigious Marketers A-List. This is the second consecutive year that Corona Extra has been named one of the best global brands by Interbrand.", "Modelo Especial won an Impact Hot Brands Award and an IMPACT Blue Chip award, with Corona Light winning a Blue Chip award from Impact as well. Modelo Especial and Victoria each received Cheers Growth Brand Awards, and Victoria also received a Market Watch Leaders Choice Award in the best new product segment. These awards highlight the continuing success of the brand portfolio and understand -- underscore Crown's unique approach to marketing.", "Overall, calendar 2011 was the largest volume year for the collection of Modelo brands in the U.S. Throughout the remainder of the year, Crown has focused on market execution and optimizing promotional and marketing initial -- initiatives. Some examples include the continued expansion of the Corona Familiar 32-ounce bottle, primarily in Mexican and Hispanic markets throughout the U.S. Launched in the U.S. in calendar 2010, Corona Familiar had strong depletions in calendar 2011. Victoria will expand to select cities within those states where it is already available. In addition, new packaging configurations are being introduced for the brand in existing markets. Victoria already ranks as a top import and is larger than many national distributed competitors in the import category. Crown continues to expand its draft offerings for the Pacifico, Negra Modelo, Modelo Especial and Victoria brands, which are doing extremely well in existing markets.", "Year-to-date, through the third quarter, Crown's depletions for its draft offerings increased 60% versus the same period last year.", "Now in closing, we believe we are in good shape to deliver our financial objectives for the year. Even though we may fall a bit short of our depletion goals for our U.S. Wine business, we have solid promotional programs in place designed to drive continued improvement in these trends throughout the remainder of the year. ", "I would now like to turn the call over to Bob Ryder for our financial discussion of our third quarter business results.", "Robert P. Ryder", "Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. The quarter came in essentially in line with our Q2 earnings call discussion. Our free cash flow is running ahead of expectations and we've increased our free cash flow guidance for the year. As it relates to earnings guidance for the year, we're maintaining our comparable basis EPS goal of $2 to $2.10 provided at Q2, which is essentially the guidance provided at the beginning of the year exclusive of the benefits from reduced shares and reduced tax rate.", "For Q3, our comparable basis diluted EPS came in at $0.50 versus $0.66 last year. The majority of the EPS decrease was driven by a 17% decline in comparable basis EBIT. This EBIT result was in line with the expectations we outlined last quarter and was driven primarily by 3 items all related to overlaps of events which occurred in fiscal '11. These include the overlap of the Q3 fiscal 2011 distributor inventory build from our U.S. Wine & Spirits distributor consolidation initiative, the overlap of the Q3 fiscal '11 distributor inventory replenishment combined with the incremental marketing funding at Crown and the divestiture of the Australia and U.K. Wine business.", "We've generated $587 million of free cash flow for the first 9 months of the year, $287 million more than the same period last year. Due to this excellent performance, we've increased our fiscal '12 free cash flow target by $100 million to a range of $700 million to $750 million, an all-time high at Constellation. Through Q3, our strong free cash flow generation has enabled us to reduce debt, repurchase stock and acquire the remaining 50% interest in the Ruffino business. I will outline more details on this activity in a moment.", "Given those brief highlights, let's look at our third quarter 2012 P&L performance in more detail, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our news release, consolidated reported net sales decreased 27%, primarily due to the divestiture of our Australian and U.K. business. North American net sales on an organic constant currency basis decreased 8%, primarily due to a decrease in volume driven by the overlap of distributor inventory build in Q3 last year. This result also reflects higher promotion cost partially offset by positive mix.", "Now let's look at our profits on a comparable basis. For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 40.5% versus 36.5% the prior year. This primarily reflects the benefit of divesting the lower gross margin Australian and U.K. business. ", "I'd now like to discuss the segment operating income results to provide highlights of our operating income change.", "North America segment operating income decreased $21 million to $172 million, primarily due to the lower volume combined with higher promotional and transportation costs partially offset by favorable product mix. Corporate costs were down $6 million, primarily related to a benefit from the early redemption of notes receivable from Accolade, our former Australian and U.K. business, and from lower compensation cost.", "As a reminder, the Australia and Europe segment reported EBIT of $11 million in Q3 last year. ", "Consolidated equity earnings totaled $53 million versus $71 million last year. Equity earnings for Crown totaled $43 million versus $58 million for the prior year. The remainder of equity earnings in Q3 of both fiscal 2012 and 2011 are primarily generated by Opus One. ", "For the quarter, Crown generated net sales of $541 million, a decrease of 12%, and operating income of $87 million, a decrease of 25%. The net sales decrease was primarily driven by lower volume due to the overlap of the prior-year quarter distributor inventory build following the supply chain issues during the summer of 2010. As Rob mentioned, Crown depletions have been growing mid-single digits in an industry experiencing negative volume growth for the year. Lower volume and higher marketing cost drove operating income decrease.", "Interest expense for the quarter was $46 million, down 6% versus last year. This decrease was primarily due to lower average borrowings.", "Let's take a look at debt. At the end of November, our debt totaled $3.1 billion. This represents a $132 million decrease from our debt level at the end of fiscal '11. Our continued strong free cash flow generation and deleveraging efforts over the past several years have enabled us to redeploy a portion of free cash flow to repurchase stock. During Q3 2012, we repurchased about 5 million shares at a cost of $94 million.", "During the first 9 months of fiscal 2012, we repurchased 15 million shares at a cost of $281 million for an average cost of $18.79 a share. We expect total repurchases through Q3 to benefit diluted EPS by approximately $0.06 for fiscal 2012.", "During the third quarter, we funded the purchase of the remaining 50% of the Ruffino business for EUR 50 million or about USD $69 million. We also assumed debt net of cash acquired of EUR 54 million or about USD $73 million. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 37% versus 29% in Q3 last year, which reflected the favorable outcome of various tax items. We continue to target a full-year tax rate of 27% for fiscal 2012.", "Several state and federal audits are still underway. The timing and resolution of these could favorably impact our tax rate for the year.", "Now let's discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the first 9 months of fiscal 2012, we generated free cash flow of $587 million versus $299 million for the same period last year. This improvement primarily reflects a reduced use of cash to fund receivables and a cash benefit for taxes. Our receivable balance increased less in [ph] the previous year due to timing of sales and the sale of our Australia and U.K. business. As a reminder, in Q1, we received a net refund of taxes primarily related to the Q4 fiscal '11 sale of our U.K. business.", "As mentioned earlier, we are increasing our fiscal 2012 free cash flow target by $100 million to a range of $700 million to $750 million. The increase is primarily due to the expected realization of additional cash tax benefits from the sale of our U.K. business that were previously targeted for fiscal 2013.", "We are also reducing our CapEx estimate by $15 million to a range of $70 million to $80 million. As previously discussed, we believe our sustainable free cash flow is in the $500 million-plus range.", "Now let's move to our full-year fiscal 2012 P&L outlook. As noted earlier, we continue to expect comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $2 to $2.10 versus our $1.91 result in fiscal '11. This includes the estimated $0.06 benefit for share repurchases, which is consistent with our previous guidance. As outlined by Rob, we now expect depletions for our U.S. Wine & Spirits business to come in a bit below the market trend and our planned target for the full year. We expect the corresponding shortfall in sales volume to be somewhat offset by some mix benefits and cost reductions. We've also reduced our interest expense guidance.", "For Crown, we continue to target low to mid-single digit depletion growth for the year and flat to slightly down operating earnings due to the incremental marketing funding. I would also like to highlight a few Q4 fiscal '12 comparison items for you. For our North American business, we're facing an easier shipment comparison for Q4, as the inventory build during fiscal '11 was effectively completed by the end of Q3. We are also expecting lower promotional expense and some additional mix benefit in Q4 versus Q4 last year. For Crown, in Q4, we expect an improvement in sales growth and marketing spend to moderate versus the higher levels experienced in Q2 and Q3 of this fiscal year.", "Overall, the good news is that the Beer business continues to drive growth in a difficult category, and we are seeing improving depletions and marketplace trends for our Wine & Spirit business, as our focus brands are performing better and our new product development initiatives are gaining traction. ", "Our strong free cash flow generation and deleveraging efforts have created flexibility in our capital structure management. This flexibility has enabled us to buy back a significant number of shares as we have repurchased $281 million of stock through Q3, which is on top of the $300 million we repurchased in the last fiscal year.", "We expect to continue to evaluate share repurchases as an opportunistic basis as part of our ongoing efforts to optimize the capital structure of the business.", "With that, we're happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]  Your first question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with UBS.", "Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "If I could start maybe and just see if you can quantify for us the impact that Arbor Mist and Vendange have on your overall focus brand depletions?", "Robert Sands", "Yes. It actually [indiscernible] had quite a significant impact. And if we had -- if we stripped out just those 2 brands, we would have gained share in the overall category -- wine category for the quarter. So that was -- that really has been a big driver of our overall market share loss in total wine. Now if you look at just table wine, we did gain share in the quarter. And if you look at Premium Plus, we gained share in the quarter too, and I mentioned that because clearly, the Premium Plus category above $5 is our primary focus.", "Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Got it. And then also just a follow-up on quantification, is there any way for you to give us some context on what growth may have been -- on shipments, excluding the inventory build from -- at Crown last year?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes. This is Bob. Kaumil, I don't think we'd get into that kind of detail.", "Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, no problem. And then just clarifying something on your guidance for Crown. You said improved sales growth and marketing spend to moderate. I just want to understand because -- was that from a depletions perspective or is that from a shipments perspective? And then also, was the increased volume last year in 4Q also the replenishment of the supply issues?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes. So the replenishment of the supply chain issues in the Beer business was done by the end of the fourth quarter \u2013- by the end of the third quarter. So the fourth quarter from a shipment depletion perspective was pretty clean, okay? So we expect to -- for shipments and depletions to continue to have pretty good growth in the fourth quarter. Now this year, one of the reasons that the Beer business' EBIT is down is the incremental marketing spend. We think the majority of that is behind us, as this year they spent the wide majority of that incremental monies in the peak summer season, so in Q2, Q3. So that's why I said Q4, we expect continued or even slightly better sales growth, which would -- the same as depletion growth for the fourth quarter and reduced marketing as opposed to the previous year.", "Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Got it. And final question on prioritization of the free cash flow, you now have $100 million more than planned. Should we -- given how often you talked about the buyback in your prepared remarks, should we assume that much of that can go towards -- in incremental buyback?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes. Well, I mean, our board authorization is still at the $500 million level. We have a little bit over $200 million left on that. We don't have any additional board authorization at this point. But as usual, we\u2019ll be looking at the market and general trends to see whether we should be out there buying back more of our shares.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Rob, just on the Wine business, just as you think about the payback that you've gotten in this -- in the current quarter from higher promotions. Obviously, depletions improved sequentially, but it seems like it sort of came at the expense of higher promos. So can you maybe help us understand, do you think you've got enough payback on those spending? What will sort of the competitive environment look like? And then as you look out in fiscal '13, with all lot of these new products coming in line, how should we think about the promotional spending? And then is 2013, finally, the year where you think that you can get your Wine business to grow in line with the category growth?", "Robert Sands", "Yes. So, I think in terms of payback on promotional spending, we certainly feel that we are getting a payback, and you can sort of see it as a result of the sequential improvement in growth when we increased promotional spending. Now we do also mitigate that to a degree and fund it, by taking some of the actions, which we've taken such as increasing that price on our value brands, where we frankly don't care that much about share to help fund and offset some of the cost of promoting our Premium Plus portfolio. But in general, yes, promotional expense is up net net net. And yes, we think that it is paying back, given where we would otherwise be if we didn't do so. What was your second question, Judy?", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So if that's the case...", "Robert Sands", "As far as growing with the category next year, our plan is certainly to grow in line with the category next year. And as we built momentum this year and are either depending on the category, exceeding growth rates or nearing total category growth rates, we should go into next year with good momentum to achieve that.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then Bob, just in terms of the whole shipment versus depletion delta on the wine business, are we completely now done just in terms of the distortions in the fourth quarter would still distort [ph] off cleanly as depletions matches shipments at your wholesaler level?", "Robert Sands", "Yes. I mean, I'd say the wide majority of it is done. There could still be some adjustments for the fourth quarter because what we've said is for the full year, shipments will equal depletions, right? So you kind of adjust in the fourth quarter to get to the full year balance.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then on the Crown side, just any update on thinking just in terms of how you're thinking about pricing? Clearly, your depletion trends have been pretty healthy, but the margins have not really followed through. So just how you're thinking about pricing at this point?", "Robert Sands", "Yes, good question. So as we know, the beer category has been experiencing negative volumes. The larger domestic players have been taking some pricing. We actually at the Crown business took some frontline pricing in October, not as much as the domestic players, and the pricing was different by brands and by geographies. But the other thing that the Crown business is doing is reducing its promotion spending, which is, in essence, an increase in the net price to the consumer. Now that reduced promotion spending is reinvested in marketing. So that's why when you see the Crown income statement, you'll see a pretty big increase in marketing expense because there's 2 things going on there. There's money coming from promotion down into marketing and there's the incremental funding that's occurring on the Crown P&L versus the prior year. So it's a pretty big increase in the marketing spend. And looking at how volumes and how dollars sales growth has been doing versus the category, it seems to be being pretty successful, and the marketing has been pretty well received. Rob gave some of those awards. So I think those guys are doing a good job and feeling good about their top line. I think the marketing overlaps from prior year are kind of hurting the bottom line, but that should abate as we go into next year.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So if you take the frontline pricing and the reduced promo spending on Crown, the net price per barrel would've been up sort of 1% to 2% kind of level?", "Robert P. Ryder", "That's probably about right, maybe on the high end of that. Judy, you can kind of look at IRI and look at the volume growth versus the net sales growth, so you'll see that the net pricing to the consumer and IRI is up just north of 2%, which is less than the domestic guys but still pretty healthy, especially when you compare that to how the volumes are doing to prior year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.", "Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "So you mentioned innovation as one of the primary drivers to drive improved wine market share trends going forward. But I think previously, you would thought that would play out this holiday season. So I just want to get a sense from you on how much of an increase in innovation contribution you're expecting in calendar 2012 versus 2011 or the pipeline of innovation you have planned versus this year, and if there's a significant ramp-up going forward?", "Robert Sands", "Yes. We expect pretty significant increase in the contribution of innovation to our growth in next year, whether it's calendar 2012 or fiscal 2013, almost probably double the rate of the contribution that innovation made in 2012 or calendar 2011. So as I mentioned in my talk, we have very ramped up new product initiatives and expect to introduce almost 20 new products into the marketplace. And this year, it contributed roughly 200 basis points or 2% to our overall growth. And next year it should, as I said, contribute significantly more.", "Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And can you give us an update on your thoughts for the pricing environment in the wine category as we look out to calendar 2012 here and an update on the promotional environment?", "Robert Sands", "Yes. I would say, starting with the promotional environment and the holiday season, it's been fairly consistent with how things have played out through the year and basically with last year. Now as you are aware from previous calls, this year's harvest in California was down, and in certain areas and certain varietals, oversupply is turning into undersupply, especially in the North Coast. And as a consequence to that, I would say that we probably think that you will see some pricing being taken on some -- especially higher end products that are suffering from some of the undersupply. That said, are we seeing any widespread examples of that? No. I've put that just more in the category of what people think as opposed to what's really happening. So we're going to be watching it very carefully as we go into next year and see what's happening out there in the marketplace.", "Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And are you anticipating adjusting pricing at all in the value wines, given some of the demand elasticity issues, or are you more focused on profitability at this point?", "Robert Sands", "We kind of pulsed that activity, so we've taken some pricing up on some of the value wines and then we've taken some of the pricing back down on the value wines, depending on whether we think we're getting the benefit from the pricing or not over an appropriate period of time. So it can kind of go both ways. But in general, I would say that we're going to be more inclined to price value wines than the opposite, meaning take pricing down or drive for volume or share.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey with D.A. Davidson.", "Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Just -- Rob, wondering how you think about the dollar price point positioning of your portfolio now versus the wine category. It seems to me that it skews more favorably up the price point than it did several years ago, and that's been kind of where the growth is in the wine sector. Why shouldn\u2019t we think that you would outperform the overall wine category in 2013, or fiscal 2013, I should say?", "Robert Sands", "Well, again, whether we gain share or lose share in the category, it will be very dependent on sort of the decisions we make as to how we price various elements of our portfolio. Our portfolio is large. We've got a lot of wine, and I'll say outside of mainstream categories, whether it's beverage dessert wines, kosher wines, fruit-flavored varietal wine. And we are very tactical on our decisions from a financial perspective as to whether to opt more for pricing or whether to opt more for value. I'd say that's sort of the best measure of how we're doing overall is how we're doing on our focus brands, which is a relatively small portfolio of 17 brands and constitutes the vast majority of our profitability in the United States. So there, we're particularly interested in whether we're gaining or losing share. Now that said, one of the focus brands is the value brand. It is Arbor Mist, it's a big brand. And as I have said, we have made the decision, and we did so last year to -- or this year actuality of this current year to tactically raise prices on that particular brand and to sacrifice some volume, which did impact the overall growth rate of the focus brands. So it's some and some.", "Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Got you. And just a quick one on some of the brands that you used to own over at Essencia. Any -- I hear that some of those are either on the block or somewhat distressed. Any thoughts on that? You've done -- you've managed those brands before, would it make sense to look at them again?", "Robert Sands", "No. We sold them.", "Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. That's definitive.", "Robert Sands", "Nothing that we sold that we want back at the moment.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Reza Vahabzadeh with Barclays Capital.", "Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital Inc.", "You talked about optimizing the cap structure, as well as the share buyback activities. Can you continue with the share repurchase activities and delever the balance sheet and get the leverage down to perhaps below 3x in the coming year, given your $600 million to $700 million -- $600 million to $750 million of cash flow?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, Reza. This is Bob. I mean, obviously, you decide how much stock to buy back, right? So this year, we've given new guidance, which is improved, and we decide if we're going to buy any more stock in the fourth quarter, we have to decide, because next year, we should have $500 million-plus of free cash flow because it will be at least a sustainable year next year. So we would be able to delever and buy stock depending how much stock we buy back.", "Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital Inc.", "Right. And you still want to delever, right? In the past, I think you've thrown out 2.5, 3 turns as well?", "Robert P. Ryder", "No. I think what we've said is our ideal structure is 3 to 4 turns, right? And year-to-date, I think as of the -- if you just use our guidance and assume we don't buy back any more stock, I think we'll finish the year just under 3.4. Had we not bought any stock back, I think we would've been much closer to 3.0. So we've made conscious decisions by buying back stock to stay north of 3.0, and we will assess those as we go along.", "Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital Inc.", "Fair enough. And then have you commented on the food service channel, the restaurant channel on how sales are progressing in that channel for your products?", "Robert Sands", "Yes. I think that we're seeing the on-premise channel up for the first time in a long time for us. We've probably gained share on a dollar perspective and lost share on a volume perspective because we've significantly changed the mix of product that we're selling in the on-premise to more high-end Premium Plus product from, I'd say lower end. So the on-premise is rebounding. It's up a bit, we believe, overall, and we believe we're gaining share from a dollar perspective.", "Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital Inc.", "But to the category itself, on-premise is up in terms of sales?", "Robert Sands", "Correct. Probably in the 1% to 2% range.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Citigroup.", "Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "My question has to do with the focus brand strategy, specifically while I recognize that the wine category is highly fragmented, so you need a number of offerings to compete effectively. I do wonder a little bit whether 19 focus brands is maybe too many, and could you possibly better leverage your investments if you narrowed your focus a little bit? Is that under consideration at all?", "Robert Sands", "So I don't think that 19 is necessarily too many. But that said, we have had, I'll say, a strategy of narrowing our focus and investment against a smaller number of brand even within our focus brands. So fundamentally, the answer to your question is no, they're not too many, but yes, we agree that in terms of investment that probably narrowing the focus and making bigger bets against a smaller number of brands is probably strategically the way to go. On the other hand, a lot of these brands are very profitable and need to be looked after appropriately. So fundamentally, we agree strategically with what you just suggested.", "Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. Within that subset then, the really focused focus brands, where do those fall generally across the pricing spectrum?", "Robert Sands", "Well, we look at those at -- first of all, we don't have a subset of focused focus brands. You made that up, not us. But going along with that concept, you kind of start with what is the biggest piece of the portfolio, and that's the Mondavi franchise, Robert Mondavi at Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi, okay? That in and of itself is a large part or the most important part of the focus brand portfolio. Then you got a few -- I'm not just talking about wine here, you got a few other important brands, like SVEDKA Vodka, like Kim Crawford. Those would be examples of brands that really rise to the top in terms of their level of importance, Clos du Bois in the overall focus brand portfolio. And I guess I didn't quite answer your question. If you look at Woodbridge, that's Premium. If you look at Clos du Bois, that's Super-Premium. If you look at Kim Crawford, that's Luxury. If you look at Robert Mondavi Private Selection, that's Super-Premium and Robert Mondavi Napa is Luxury.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "So couple of questions on wine, and then one on Crown. Rob, you gave us that 2% depletion or that 2% contribution from innovation year-to-date for the wine business. Is that a contribution to depletions?", "Robert Sands", "Yes.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Got it, great. And then as you think about -- you remarked that you think you can grow in line with the wine category still in spite of some of these value challenges this year. How do you feel about your ability to grow operating income faster than the wine category, given the experience with spending and the mix issue and so forth?", "Robert Sands", "Yes. So to your first question, we did not say that we would grow in line with the category this year. I would say that...", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I'm sorry, I mean calendar '12, fiscal '13.", "Robert Sands", "Okay, yes. And then to your second question, we should be able to leverage the P&L.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "You do expect to, great. And then over on Crown, are we kind of done with the structural step-up in marketing spend? Do you think fiscal '13 is more of a operating income in line with revenue type of year?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes. I mean, I think we're done, Mark, with the step-up in marketing. There might still be some flux between promo spend in marketing, but they kind of zero off, it kind of gets to the bottom line. So all you'll be left with is pretty much pricing and -- normal stuff, pricing and mix. Now we do have the contractual cost of goods sold increase, okay? So just normal stuff, but I think the increased marketing and promotion spending will be behind us, and it will be a apples-to-apples year if you look at fiscal '13 over fiscal '12 from a marketing and spending perspective at Crown.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Great. And if I could build a little on the earlier question about operating income in wine growing faster than revenue. From where I sit, it's hard to see why your -- you have that view. Is that a function of your mix view? Is it simply leveraging of the fixed costs? Can you talk a little bit more about that, Rob?", "Robert Sands", "Yes, I think, Mark, most of it would come from -- we have some pretty robust plans in place to reduce cost of goods sold, and we talked about these a number of times around things like reduced number of bottling lines or higher fixed cost leverage, some blend changes, some better warehouse management, some better grape buying, things around that. I think that we will keep SG&A growing below net sales, okay? So I think those 2 areas and COGS is the big number will be -- will help us leverage the P&L. The wild card, I think, will be promotion spending, okay? Because as you know, it's a pretty fractious industry. We're not the only player, and we kind of can't raise prices when nobody else is, which is -- Rob mentioned some of that earlier. So I think the things within our control, we feel pretty good about. I think the things that are little less within our control, like pricing and promotions, well, they're not within our control. That being said, we've had 2 years in a row of short harvests. So you would hope that the industry would reduce promotion spend and maybe increase prices, but time will tell.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gary Albanese with Auriga USA.", "Gary Albanese - Auriga USA LLC, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could touch upon inventory levels, is that roughly what you were expecting? And was that impacted from the cost of the higher cost from your grape harvest this year?", "Robert Sands", "In terms of the harvest, the harvest from a dollar perspective will be smaller this year than it was last. And therefore, that's had a positive impact on our inventories and our cash flow this year. And I will say that the harvest was a bit smaller than we expected, and therefore, the inventory impact and positive cash flow impact was a bit greater than we expected. Hence, we started the year with lower cash flow guidance than we're ending the year with. And we've increased our cash flow guidance, and that was one of the components of why cash flow is coming in higher than our initial guidance. Is that what you were asking me about, Gary?", "Gary Albanese - Auriga USA LLC, Research Division", "To some degree, to some degree. Let me move on to SVEDKA. I mean, double-digit growth again in the quarter. Are you guys still on pace to exceed or was it 4 million cases I think you said the last quarter?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Gary, I'm sorry, we're having a tough time hearing you.", "Gary Albanese - Auriga USA LLC, Research Division", "Sure. SVEDKA, are you still on pace to exceed 4 million cases this year?", "Robert Sands", "No, we'll be at slightly under it, but we're fundamentally on pace to be around 4 million cases. So yes, it's -- it will be around 4 million, and certainly, the run rate is at that level. And SVEDKA is generally meeting all of our expectations and continues to grow double-digit now on a very large base. It's the third-largest vodka brand.", "Gary Albanese - Auriga USA LLC, Research Division", "Yes. I mean, being that, that\u2019s a smallest segment, I know it's been posed -- the question\u2019s been posed to you in the past about  whether it fits. But is that actually an area that the Spirits business that you contemplate actually growing?", "Robert Sands", "Well, our Spirits business is 3 brands basically, SVEDKA, Black Velvet and Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy, 3 big brands. And yes, I mean, we're certainly, conscientiously and specifically trying to grow that business, with our primary focus being taking advantage of our position in the vodka category with basically the hottest large brand.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Carla Casella with JPMorgan.", "Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "If you -- looking at your distributor markets, what percentage of your business now is in markets where it's a sole distributor? And is there still more markets to go there?", "Robert Sands", "So in terms of what we've consolidated, 60% of our business is -- has been consolidated in those markets where we've been able to do that in the United States, so 60%. And then of the remaining 40%, there's probably about another 8% for argument's sake that, in theory, could be more consolidated in the manner that we consolidated the initial 60%. And the reason that there's only 8% of the remaining 40% is because you have to remember that some of the markets are controlled state markets, like Pennsylvania, where there's really -- where the whole concept of consolidating contributors is inapplicable. And then another large percentage are what are called franchise [indiscernible], which means that we don't have the ability to necessarily terminate the existing distributors pursuant to consolidation plan. So it's difficult to change your distribution network in those franchise markets. So 8%.", "Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then do you see -- oh, go ahead sorry?", "Robert Sands", "Sorry, just saying 8%.", "Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Do you see a big difference in performance between the distributor and then -- I'm sorry, the sole distributor and the multiple distributor markets?", "Robert Sands", "Yes, and it's not so much sole distributor and multiple distributor, although that's a part of it. But what really -- yes, the answer is yes. We definitely are outperforming in markets where we've implemented our distributor consolidation efforts. But then that -- what are some of the things that really drive that the -- where we're able to consolidate, we're able to have exclusive sales forces within those distributors selling only our products. And that gives us a lot of additional focus on our portfolio as being -- opposed to being just part of a general sales force that\u2019s selling multiple products. So the answer is yes, we're outperforming in those markets.", "Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just one follow-up, you may have already answered, and I may have missed it, but can you say whether there's been any change in terms of the timing of the Crown JV decision? Is that still an end of -- I think it's end of 2012 event we should know?", "Robert Sands", "No. There's -- the initial term of the Crown contract was 10 years ending 2016. It cannot be terminated or altered for 5 more years. There are notice provisions as to what they may propose that would require them to give us notice 3 years in advance of the termination at the end of 2016. But there's 5 years left on the Crown contract period, and it automatically renews for another 10 years in the -- except in the event of their giving us advanced notice of nonrenewal.", "Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, great. So the earliest would be the notice period would be end of 2013?", "Robert Sands", "That's only notice.", "Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Right, only notice for the termination in 2012 if that were to occur, okay.", "Operator", "That was our final question. And I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Rob Sands for any closing remarks.", "Robert Sands", "Okay. Well, thank you all for joining our call today. I would say that overall, I'm very satisfied with the third quarter results, and would summarize the highlights as follows: We generated very, very strong free cash flow, and as a result, have increased our guidance for the year; our strong free cash flow results have enabled us to fund share repurchases, and we expect to be opportunistic in this regard as part of our ongoing efforts to optimize the capital structure of the business; we are experienced improving depletion momentum for our U.S. Wine business and the Spirits business as well, and our new product development initiatives are being well received in the marketplace; and our Crown Imports Beer business continues its strong marketplace momentum. Our plan is to continue solid execution of our initiatives throughout the final quarter of the year. Thanks again, everyone, for your participation.", "Operator", "Thank you.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Constellation Brands Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2012 Full Year Earnings Report. [Operator Instructions] ", "I would now turn the conference over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations, for opening comments. Please go ahead.", "Patty Yahn-Urlaub", "Thank you, Maria. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Constellation's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year End 2012 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer.  ", "This call complements our news release, which has been also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP, comparable, organic and constant-currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com under the Investors section in Financial History.

This morning, I plan to discuss Constellation's year-end results and provide a high-level outline for our plans for fiscal 2013. ", "It is certainly worth noting that we have had a very productive year in 2012, delivering against a number of key strategic goals and business initiatives. I would like to take a minute to highlight some of our achievements. ", "I am especially pleased with our record free cash flow results and our significantly improved consolidated margin structure, resulting from last year's sale of our U.K. and Australian businesses. We utilized our free cash flow to reduce debt and repurchased more than $400 million of our shares in fiscal 2012. This follows a $300 million accelerated share buyback transaction, which was completed in fiscal 2011. And in fiscal 2013, we plan to continue to return value to our shareholders in the form of a new $1 billion share repurchase program that has been recently authorized by our Board of Directors. We expect to execute approximately 50% of the new authorization this year after repurchasing the remaining shares available under our fiscal 2012 authorization. ", "We purchased the remaining portion of the Ruffino wine business, which is an iconic old world wine brand that builds a niche for Constellation in the growing Italian premium wine category. Ruffino is one of our larger focus brands, posting depletion growth of almost 10% in fiscal 2012. It is also the #3 Italian super-premium wine brand in SymphonyIRI channels. ", "We became more unified and integrated as one company by advancing our fusion technology initiative, and we are currently implementing a shared service infrastructure. Collectively, these initiatives are designed to create an integrated technology platform and enhance the processes that support our business.  ", "We expanded our international presence by establishing an office in Hong Kong, and we are currently in the process of exploring next steps for our emerging market participation strategy. ", "Fiscal 2012 marked our highest level of brand building activity in recent history, which is paying off in the marketplace. A few examples include SVEDKA. We introduced new packaging configurations and flavor profiles, which helped the brand to surpass Gray Goose in volume sales, making it the second largest imported vodka brand in the U.S. today. ", "We launched more than 25 new products in fiscal 2012, including the introduction of 4 new wine brands in fast-growing categories. They include Simply Naked, Primal Roots, Rioja Vega and The Dreaming Tree. ", "In the U.S. beer market, Crown continued its launch of Victoria, which posted significant growth and was awarded the Leader's Choice Award as the Best New Product by Market Watch magazine. Victoria has also become the #1 new beer in terms of dollar sales in the SymphonyIRI food, drug, mass and convenience channels. ", "In response to the need of consumers looking for additional ways to enjoy products, Crown also expanded its draft beer offerings, which resulted in depletion growth of almost 60% for this format and increased brand recognition for the Modelo Especial, Negra Modelo, Pacifico and Victoria brands. ", "We have recently launched the next phase of our U.S. distributor consolidation efforts in markets where it makes sense. The signing of multi-year agreements with additional U.S. distributors covering almost 10% of our U.S. wine and spirits volume will give them the right to sell Constellation's portfolio of wine and/or spirits exclusively in their respective markets. ", "In the first phase of our U.S. distributor consolidation initiative, which incurred -- occurred in the latter half of 2009, we gave exclusive appointments to 4 distributors to represent approximately 60% of our U.S. wine and spirits business in 22 states. As you know, the ultimate goal of this differentiated distributor model is to drive profitable organic growth through fully dedicated distributor teams more closely aligned with Constellation's sales force; investment of incremental marketing and promotional support behind Constellation brands; a distributor incentive structure designed to significantly increase distributor performance, with a focus on higher-margin, higher ROIC brands.", "One of the key metrics we utilized to measure the success of our U.S. distributor consolidation effort is depletion trends. I am pleased to report that those dates where our business has already transitioned to this model have outperformed the states where reconciliation has not occurred. And in terms of overall U.S. depletion performance for fiscal 2012, our distributor sales to retail for Constellation's total U.S. wine and spirits business across all channels increased approximately 2% for the year, with wine-only portion growing slightly less.", "In comparison from an industry perspective, according to recently released data from the Beverage Information Group for calendar 2011, the U.S. market grew about 2.5% in total across all channels. As previously discussed, our depletion results somewhat lagged the industry in fiscal 2012. This was primarily the result of price increases taken for some of our higher volume brands, which negatively impacted their sales to a greater degree than we originally anticipated, as well as soft performance for our Blackstone and Ravenswood brands. ", "However, we relaunched, reformulated and repackaged Blackstone and Ravenswood, which experienced improved depletion performance later in the year. And overall depletion trends improved as we progressed through the year due to the gating of promotional spend for our U.S. wine and spirits businesses. In fact, during the fourth quarter, we posted depletion growth of more than 7% for our entire portfolio, exceeding the growth rate of the total U.S. wine and spirits category. ", "Some of that fourth quarter performance was driven by channel fill for new products, which may unfavorably impact our sales and depletion performance in the first quarter. However, we expect consumer takeaway of our products at retail to continue to meet our expectations.  Overall, we remain committed to growing in line with U.S. wine and spirits industry growth for fiscal 2013 and beyond. ", "For the year, SVEDKA posted double-digit depletion and consumer takeaway trends in addition to gaining volume share of the vodka category.  SVEDKA remains one of the fastest-growing vodka brands and has become the #2 imported vodka in the U.S. It is also a top 100 global spirits brand, reaching more than 3.7 million cases in depletions in fiscal 2012. The new SVEDKA advertising campaign will debut this month, appearing on the top national cable TV stations and popular websites.  Be sure to look for the fembot on your favorite cable TV channel, perhaps while you're watching Real Housewives on the Bravo channel or SportsCenter on ESPN. ", "Now I'd like to focus our discussion on where we're headed in fiscal 2013. We will continue to focus on innovation and new product development activities as we plan to introduce more than 50 new items throughout fiscal 2013, some of which are new brands or packaging innovations, such as Arbor Mist frozen wine cocktails. I am particularly excited about a new brand introduction called Thorny Rose, which is specifically targeted for the millennial generation. ", "As we've discussed today, today's wine market is growing by the legal drinking age millennials, a group which numbers more than 55 million and is expected to grow by an additional 12 million within the next 3 years. We have -- also have a national TV launch planned for our Black Box and new Simply Naked wine brands, which currently have great marketplace momentum. ", "Similar to last year, many of our new products are included in the hot categories that are experiencing significant growth, and we expect to have an increasing percentage of our overall sales growth this year coming from the contribution of new products. One of the most important things to keep in mind is that many of our new products will be line extensions to our existing portfolio of focus brands, which represent the majority of our U.S. wine profitability and posted depletion trends of more than 6% last year. ", "As many of these focus brands have recently received recognition in the form of awards and accolades, the following of which are particularly noteworthy. Constellation recently received Impact 2011 Hot Brand awards for SVEDKA, Franciscan, Kim Crawford, Rex Goliath and Black Box. Three of our newly launched U.S. wine brands were included in IRI's list of the Top 10 New Table Wine Brands. ", "We recently received Beverage Information Group's 2012 Growth Brand Awards for SVEDKA, Kim Crawford, Simply Naked, Primal Roots, The Dreaming Tree, Rioja Vega, Black Box, bl\u00fcfeld and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. Our U.S. business was recognized with the 2012 Cheers' Supplier Excellence Award as Supplier of the Year for Best Large Wine Company and the Vibe Supplier Excellence Award as Supplier of the Year. ", "As you can infer from our fiscal 2013 guidance, our EBITDA growth this year will be somewhat impacted by our brand building initiatives, as well as additional sales investments. Bob will provide additional details on this in a moment.", "Now moving to our Crown imports joint venture. Crown had an exceptional year in the marketplace. Overall, calendar 2011 was the largest sales volume year for the collection of Modelo brands in the U.S. marketplace. And although you've heard us this many times throughout fiscal 2012, I believe it's worth repeating. Crown outperformed the total U.S. beer industry and the import category across both on- and off-premise channels and gained market share for the year. This is the result of a great product innovation, creative advertising campaigns, the ongoing support of wholesalers and excellent market execution. ", "Crown implemented several new initiatives, increased marketing investments and launched new items and packaging configurations in an effort to continue building value and increasing brand recognition. This is the 15th consecutive year that Corona Extra remains the leader in the premium imported beer category. Corona Familiar, a new SKU introduced in 2010, depleted more than 3.5 million cases in fiscal 2012. Modelo Especial remains the #3 imported beer in the U.S. This brand grew double digits and achieved a new milestone of 35 million cases sold last year.  Corona Light holds the top spot among imported light beers, and Negra Modelo and Pacifico remain among the top 25 import brands, with Victoria already breaking through and becoming a top 25 brand as well. ", "Throughout fiscal 2012, Crown achieved several milestones and received recognition from some of the most notable beer and marketing channels in the industry, including Impact Hot Brand and Blue Chip Awards for Modelo Especial and Corona Light. These awards highlight the continuing success of the brand portfolio and underscore Crown's unique approach to marketing.", "As we head into fiscal 2013, Crown has some exciting marketing initiatives underway. Some examples include the Corona Win Your Beach Retail promotion, which was so successful during last year's summer selling season, will be bigger and better this year, offering consumers more ways to enter and more chances to win prizes of their choice to fit their preferred beach experience. This promotion will be accompanied by a new Win Your Beach TV spot. ", "Crown will be dedicating additional resources to its continuing sponsorship of Jon Gruden's ESPN Monday Night Football Countdown. And beginning in the second quarter, Crown will launch new advertising for Corona Light, which will be supplemented by a combined TV, digital and social media campaign. For Modelo Especial, the first-ever English language TV campaign will highlight the quality of Modelo Especial and engage the general market consumer. Separate advertising will continue for the Hispanic consumer as well.", "Crown will once again partner with Kenny Chesney for his U.S. tour, with Corona Light as the sponsor. This initiative allows for greater awareness opportunity for Corona Light and fits with the current Chesney consumer profile. TV commercials promoting Corona Light and Kenny will run in tour markets in the weeks leading up to the shows. The successful Find Your Beach advertising campaign will be extended, with new creative in fiscal 2013. ", "Crown also plans to expand its draft offerings and will introduce new packaging configurations to the Modelo Especial lineup during the year.  These initiatives are expected to result in fiscal 2013 depletion and operating income growth in the low single-digit range for Crown. ", "Now with closing, as you can see, fiscal 2013 is shaping up to be another year of strong progress towards our strategic goals. With the achievements we made in fiscal 2012, our focus this year will remain largely unchanged. We will continue to drive growth in our base business through brand building and innovation, expand our international business in new and emerging markets and further strengthen the core of the company. And our strong free cash flow target enables us to create value in the form of significant share buyback program.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our year-end business results and forecasted guidance for 2013.", "Robert P. Ryder", "Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Our comparable basis EPS for fiscal 2012 came in at $2.34. This result included tax rate benefits recognized in Q4, which drove the full year tax rate of 17% versus our previous 27% rate expectation. Exclusive of the reduced tax rate, our results were generally in line with our expectations. ", "From an operational perspective, our comparable basis operating margin improved more than 400 basis points, reflecting benefits from the sale of our Australian and U.K. business at the end of fiscal 2011. While our U.S. wines and spirits sales and depletions came in below target for the year, we saw improving trends in the fourth quarter, with good energy around new products and our focus brands. ", "On the beer side, marketing investments and solid execution drove strong marketplace performance for the year. Our EBIT came in a bit lower than originally expected. This was due to the North American wine sales results just discussed and realizing less sales mix benefit at Crown versus our initial expectations. SG&A austerity measures and some positive nonrecurring benefits mollified the impact of the sales shortfall on EBIT.", "From a free cash flow perspective, we generated $716 million for the year. This was a record by a large measure and included significant tax-related cash benefits. This strong result enabled us to repurchase a significant amount of stock, acquire the remaining interest in Ruffino business and reduce debt. I will outline more details on these activities in a moment.", "Given these brief highlights, let's look at fiscal 2012 P&L performance in more detail where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our news release, consolidated reported net sales decreased 20%, primarily due to the divestiture of our Australian and U.K. business. North American net sales on an organic constant currency basis decreased 1%. This was primarily due to a decrease in volume, driven by the overlap of a distributor inventory build last year, partially offset by positive mix. ", "Now let's look at our profits on a comparable basis.  For the year, our consolidated gross margin was 40.1% versus 35.9% for the prior year. This primarily reflects the benefit of divesting the lower gross margin Australian and U.K. business, partially offset by the overlap of the prior year build in distributor inventory. ", "I'd now like to discuss the segment operating income results to provide highlights of our operating income change.  North America segment operating income decreased $9 million to $622 million, primarily due to lower volume, partially offset by favorable mix. Corporate costs were down $25 million, primarily related to overlapping a higher compensation expense result in fiscal '11, lower professional services costs and the early redemption of notes receivable from Accolade, our former Australian and U.K. business. And as a reminder, the Australian/Europe segment reported EBIT of $15 million last year.", "Consolidated equity earnings totaled $229 million versus $244 million last year. The reduction is primarily due to the sale of our interest in Matthew Clark and other joint ventures as part of our Australian and U.K. business divestiture and from reduced earnings at Crown. ", "For the year, Crown generated net sales of $2.5 billion, an increase of 3%, and operating income of $431 million, a decrease of 5%. The net sales increase was primarily driven by volume growth of Modelo Especial and from the expansion of Corona Familiar and Victoria. Higher marketing cost drove the operating income decrease. Interest expense for the year was $181 million, down 7% versus the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lower average borrowings.", "Let's take a look at our debt position. At the end of February, our total debt totaled $3.1 billion. This represents a $107 million decrease from our debt level at the end of the previous year. Our continued strong free cash flow generation and deleveraging efforts over the past several years have enabled us to redeploy a portion of free cash flow to repurchase stock. During fiscal 2012, we repurchased 21.2 million shares at a cost of $414 million. That's an average cost of $19.48 a share. This follows a repurchase of 17.2 million shares at a cost of $300 million in fiscal '11.", "As a reminder, during the third quarter, we funded the purchase of the remaining 50% of the Ruffino business for EUR 50 million or USD $69 million. We also assumed debt, net of cash acquired, of EUR 54 million or USD $73 million.", "As mentioned earlier, our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 17%, which reflected a favorable outcome of various federal items in the second quarter and state tax items in the fourth quarter. This compares to a 30% rate for the prior year. This was a very favorable outcome that we highlighted as a possibility in our Q3 call. ", "Now let's briefly discuss Q4 results. The recognition of tax rate benefits in the fourth quarter helped drive a comparable basis EPS result of $0.69 versus $0.35 in Q4 last year. Organic constant currency net sales increased 5%, primarily due to volume growth and some favorable mix. The higher sales and lower SG&A helped to increase consolidated operating income by $19 million during Q4.", "Equity earnings for Crown in the quarter increased 2% to $49 million. For Q4, Crown's net sales increased 9% and operating income increased 2% as volume growth was mostly offset by higher marketing expense. Corporate expenses decreased $4 million, primarily due to lower compensation expense. ", "Now let's discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For fiscal 2012, we generated free cash flow of $716 million versus $531 million for the same period in the previous year. This improvement reflects a cash benefit for taxes, primarily driven by the sale of our U.K. business. In addition, our receivable balance increased less than the previous year due to the timing of sales, while interest payments and CapEx spending were lower.", "We're targeting free cash flow for fiscal 2013 in the $425 million to $475 million range. This includes CapEx in the range of $70 million to $80 million. The projected decrease in free cash flow from fiscal 2012 is primarily due to the absence of approximately $170 million in cash tax benefits recognized in fiscal 2012 related to the sale of our U.K. business. We are also expecting a higher inventory investment as we overlap the lower calendar 2011 harvest and higher interest cost, which I will discuss further in a few minutes.  We still feel confident that we can generate $500 million plus a year in free cash flow over the longer term. ", "Now let's move to our free cash flow fiscal 2012 -- fiscal 2013 P&L outlook. We're forecasting comparable basis diluted EPS guidance to be in the range of $1.93 to $2.03 versus our $2.34 result for fiscal '12. There are many moving parts in this comparison, including share repurchases, debt refinancing and the most significant driver, an increase in the full year tax rate.  For fiscal '13, we anticipate getting closer to a statutory rate as we're targeting a tax rate of 34% versus the abnormal 17% rate in fiscal '12.", "As outlined by Rob, we expect to grow U.S. depletions in line with the U.S. category growth, and we expect shipment growth to align with depletion growth. This, combined with an anticipated mix benefit, is expected to result in sales growth in the low to mid-single-digit range. However, the overlap of our low fiscal 2012 SG&A, along with some additional brand building and selling investment in fiscal '13, is expected to keep operating income in the low single-digit growth range.", "For Crown, we're targeting low single-digit depletion and operating income growth for the year. This depletion expectation versus fiscal 2012 is due to the overlap of the Victoria and Corona Familiar rollouts. A contractual COGS increase will keep operating income growth slightly less than net sales growth. We look forward to celebrating Cinco de Mayo again this year by ringing the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, May 4. ", "As discussed earlier, the company repurchased 21.2 million shares of common stock at a cost of $414 million during fiscal '12. Since the end of fiscal '12 through March 31, the company repurchased an additional 2.1 million shares at a cost of $46 million. Through March 31, the company has purchased a total of 23.3 million shares at a cost of $460 million under its current $500 million authorization. ", "Our Board of Directors has authorized a repurchase of up to $1 billion of common stock. This is in addition to the remaining $40 million under the fiscal 2012 authorization. The company currently expects to execute the new $1 billion authorization over a 2-year period. As a result of the various activities just outlined, we're targeting $550 million to $600 million of total share repurchases in our fiscal 2013 guidance.", "In the near term, we plan to take advantage of the favorable credit and public debt market environment. This should further enhance financial flexibility, while executing our new repurchase authorization. The anticipated share repurchases and debt refinancing activities have been factored into our guidance. As a result, we're targeting interest expense in the range of $210 million to $220 million and weighted average shares in the range of 185 million to 190 million for fiscal 2013. ", "The forecasted increase in interest is being driven by an assumption that we can issue fixed rate public debt quite early in our fiscal year at an interest rate more favorable than our current fixed rate notes but a rate higher than current bank debt. Interest will also be unfavorably impacted by the full year effect of an interest rate swap that became effective on September 2011 and from the full year impact of the funding of the Ruffino purchase.", "From a leverage perspective, our debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio came in at 3.6x at the end of fiscal 2012. Even with the share repurchase and refinancing activity that I just outlined, our goal for fiscal '13 is to continue to maintain a leverage ratio in our targeted 3x to 4x range.", "I would like to note that from a gating perspective, we expect fiscal 2013 Q1 EBIT performance to come in approximately 5% to 10% below Q1 of fiscal 2012, and we expect higher interest expense throughout the year.  The EBIT reduction is due to lower sales growth in Q1 due to timing and overlaps. This is due in part to timing of promotional spending, reflecting support of new products and from a more even distribution of promotional expense throughout fiscal 2013. As a reminder, fiscal 2012 promotional spending was weighted to the second half of the year.  In addition, we expect Q1 to be impacted by timing of U.S. marketing expense as we launch new SVEDKA advertising and support several other new products. ", "Our comparable basis guidance excludes restructuring charges and unusual items, which are detailed on the last page of the press release. For fiscal 2013, we expect to incur diluted EPS charges of $0.04 for these items. This primarily relates to our cost reduction and efficiency initiative, focused on centralizing certain administrative, operational and commercial functions on a global basis that we previously outlined at Q1 of fiscal '12. This is timing-related and represents charges that were originally targeted to occur in fiscal '12 that have shifted into fiscal '13.", "As we entered fiscal 2012, we're a very different company from just a few years ago. We've greatly increased our focus on profitable organic growth, and we are beginning to see results. In Q4, our sales growth accelerated as our new products began to have a greater impact on our top line. The efficiencies from our ongoing COGS reduction activities have helped offset some of the inflationary pressures around grapes and transportation and should benefit us as we move forward. ", "We have also focused on improving our balance sheet. We've greatly improved our free cash flow generation, reduced leverage and returned significant cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. Since the end of fiscal 2010, we've reduced debt by over $700 million and reduced our EBITDA leverage ratio from 4.1x to 3.6x, while buying back over $700 million of stock and acquiring the remainder of Ruffino.", "For fiscal 2012, free cash flow hit an all-time high, and EPS greatly exceeded guidance provided at the beginning of the year, primarily due to tax benefits and share repurchases. Although we did not hit our top line targets, we were able to offset most of the shortfall with lower SG&A. ", "For fiscal '13, we're expecting to utilize our commercial product initiatives to grow in line with the U.S. wine market. We plan to return cash to shareholders through stock repurchases, while continuing to focus on maintaining a healthy balance sheet. We plan to take advantage of the current favorable debt markets to refinance our debt. While these actions will result in higher net debt and interest expense, they lengthen the tenure of our debt. We remain focused on maintaining our 3x to 4x leverage ratio target. ", "With that, we'll open up the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala of UBS.", "Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I guess first question on the step-up in spending. Is this a fiscal '13 onetime step-up? Should we be thinking of it as part of the base or something that you're going to be stepping up spending in fiscal '13 and then as we look forward from that point, it starts to come down?", "Robert Sands", "Yes, Kaumil, it really depends. All I can say is that, certainly, we're putting more investment behind brand building in 2013. As to what we'll do in the future, a lot will depend upon the competitiveness in the marketplace, what happens with grapes supply and pricing. So it's hard to say what we'll do past 2013. But obviously, our intention is to translate our sales growth into good earnings growth in the future.", "Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Got it. Then maybe if I could ask a slightly different way. Given the success of some of the new products in the wine industry over the last couple of years and how much they've contributed to growth in the wine industry, do you feel that maybe structurally it's changed, the cost of growth is perhaps higher than it used to be?", "Robert Sands", "Well, I think that sort of post the recession, the market has been very competitive. Promotional expense in wine, in particular, has been higher and has remained higher over the last several years. The consumer is definitely looking for a bargain when it comes to the buying of product. On the other hand, I'd say the growth has been pretty robust, and there's a lot of good activity in terms of consumers and new consumers in the wine market. So I think that bodes well for the future.", "Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, got it. And then also in the same context of marketing, there was a step-up in marketing at Crown. We know what the numbers are for the year. Can you talk about the -- your need or desire to spend on Crown for fiscal 2013? And then also, I may have missed it, I don't know, in your commentary, did you provide us with what the current depletions were at Crown as well?", "Robert P. Ryder", "For which year, Kaumil?", "Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So I don't know if you gave us a quarter to date after giving us what your current reported quarter was on Crown trends.", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, in fiscal '12, depletions were like up mid-single digits. For fiscal '13, they're going to be low single digits. And for the fourth quarter, both shipments and depletions were up quite a bit. That's in the press release. And really, as you know, the beer industry really had a good fourth quarter. It kind of surprised everyone in the industry, I think, but we're all happy about it. Maybe the warmer weather, maybe some economic recovery helped the beer industry come back a little bit. As far as marketing spend in Crown, I think the big increase in marketing spend is behind us. That was -- that would have been fully realized in fiscal '12. In fiscal '13, the marketing spend will be more business as usual. So we don't expect a big increase in marketing spending in fiscal '13. We continue to expect some great advertising and some great new media behind our products, but it won't be an absolute increase in spend.", "Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, got it. And then, Bob, also for you, and this is kind of brings back -- a little bit back of the envelope math. But based on your commentary on taking advantage of the current state of the debt markets, at least to me, it sounds like you could be raising up to $1 billion. Looking at your leverage, looking at the buyback, the amount of free cash flow that you're guiding towards, there will be quite a bit of cash, I think, sitting there. What would be -- could you maybe talk about what the uses of that cash would be?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, I think depending on when we go in the market and how our rates move, I think we might be sitting on a little bit of cash for a short period of time. But I think right now, the use of the cash will be to reinvest in the business. And outside of reinvesting the business, the primary use will be to buy back shares.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Rob and Bob, I guess you've talked about how the company is now in a better position to grow profitably on an organic basis. I sort of looked at your P&Ls in the last 2 or 3 years. Your EBIT has been essentially flat, and you have another year where EBIT is barely going to grow. So I guess conceptually and structurally speaking, when you look at your business, is this a business where you think you can at best grow in line with the category growth and pretty much get no leverage in terms of growing EBIT above your sales growth? Or do you think that this is still a business where you can still potentially get pretty healthy sales growth and that potentially translates to healthy EBIT growth? And how do we get confidence that, that will be the case over time?", "Robert Sands", "Yes, Judy, I think what's going on is, first of all, this year or last year, I should say, 2012 was a little disappointing in terms of our overall growth. And we felt that the healthiest thing to do for the business was to increase our investment behind brand building to really keep the momentum that we developed in the fourth quarter going throughout 2013. And that is what is resulting in, I'll say, the muted EBIT growth although we are growing EBIT. Now to your specific question, we definitely think that we can leverage the P&L, so to speak. It's not going to occur overall in 2013. But as we introduce new products, take advantage of some of the new trends in the marketplace, continue the kind of underlying sales growth momentum that we've achieved relative to consumer takeaway, we definitely think that we can leverage the P&L and grow EBIT therefore faster than sales.", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, Judy, this is Bob. Just to follow up on that, there's a bit of timing involved here. So remember, we did fall short of our sales expectations in fiscal '12. At the beginning of the year, we said we expected to grow with the U.S. wine market. We did not do that. Yet, we pretty much -- we actually blew our EPS estimate away but most of that was due to taxes. But we pretty much hit the EBIT number. Now that was due to some fortuitous SG&A outcomes, which I talked about, I think, in the third quarter call, some positives there that hit the SG&A line and some belt-tightening. So I think the company said, \"Hey, we're not hitting the sales numbers. Let's really try to go after the EBIT.\" In fiscal '13, we do expect to grow with the market, and we are making some increased brand investments. But remember, we got those SG&A overlaps, which is holding back our EBIT growth. So I wouldn't say, if you're just saying Constellation in the wine industry in general, I would hope that in a normal year with a lot of strange overlaps, that you could grow EBIT at least very close to what you're growing your net sales number. And as you know, the net sales growth in the wine category is pretty healthy.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just maybe to follow up on that, Bob. So can you quantify the SG&A overlap and then the brand investment step-up?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, for '13 over '12, I think we told the SG&A overlaps were $7 million to $10 million were positives in '12 that we're nonrecurring. And we -- I don't have a number on the top of my head for the brand building initiatives because it's in a lot of different areas. Its increased sales cost, increased marketing cost and some increased promotion costs. Some of the increased brand building costs kind of go with the mix shift in the business because the higher priced wine tends to carry with it higher brand building costs. So some of that is natural, and some of it is a little bit of a ramp-up in the stuff because we're playing a little bit of catch-up after fiscal '12. But I think the fourth quarter showed that we are very close to being caught up, and we're pretty confident about the top line estimates for fiscal '13.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And Bob, the 7% depletion growth in Q4, you said that there was some channel fill that helped  that number. Can you quantify how much that is? When you said the sales growth in fiscal '13, I think you said low to mid-single-digit, is that incorporating, I guess, the negative impact as the channel fill is reversed?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes. So the guidance would incorporate kind of the reversal of those -- the channel fill for the new product because you just have to make sure everything is loaded before the commercial activities kick in. So in general, I'd say the channel fill might have added to the top line growth, maybe 2% or 3%, in the fourth quarter.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "2% or 3%, okay. Okay. And then Bob, just in terms of ongoing tax rate, so obviously, 2012 was a good year. It steps up to 34%. I was under the impression that over time, you also have the opportunity to lower your effective tax rate. Is that not the case anymore? How should we think about your long-term tax rate?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, so really, the last few years, from a tax rate perspective, have been anomalous because we've been able to take advantage of some opportunities from some international tax planning. Now going forward, as we're primarily a North American business, and really most of our sales and most of our people are in pretty high-tax states, mostly California and New York, probably the statutory rate for us would be around 38%. So a 34% rate next year also has some positive tax planning in it. And we have a very good tax department, so I presume that we'll always have some positive tax planning. But I would say, on an ongoing basis, we should assume a statutory tax rate, probably 34% to 37%. The cash tax rates might be below that because of some timing benefits.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Torres of HSBC.", "Lauren Torres - HSBC, Research Division", "My question has to do with pricing, particularly at Crown. As we know, we haven't pricing there for quite some time. Just curious, when or where do you think there's opportunity to do that? I mean, are you just reacting to your competitors? Do you think the environment is just not ready for it? And then I guess just thinking about your guidance, as you talk about, I guess, low single-digit income growth this year at Crown, how do you get there if you're increasing your spend, not taking pricing? I mean, is this all volume or there's something else in that number that we should understand?", "Robert P. Ryder", "I would say, in beer pricing, Crown did take pricing in the fall of calendar '11, not quite as much as the domestic players took, but it took some pricing, which you can see in IRI. And remember, Crown, although it's the number -- it's the third largest beer company in the U.S., it's a very distant #3. So I would say that for fiscal '13, our beer business is closely watching what the large domestic players do. And should they move up, and generally they do in -- after the peak summer season, we might follow. Over the last few years, because of the economy and some other reasons, we've -- the import beer price gap to the domestic premium has gotten less. So we're closer priced to the domestic premium, but I would hope -- I think that, that reduction has stopped. So we're not anticipating in our guidance a lot of pricing in beer. But if the domestic guys move and we feel that we can move, we'll probably look at it in certain regions. I would say for the Crown earnings guidance, essentially, the EBIT growth is coming from increased volumes. The operating earnings guidance growth is slightly less than the net sales growth because of the contractual cost of goods sold increase from Modelo, the brand owner.", "Lauren Torres - HSBC, Research Division", "Okay. And when we think about that cost increase you just mentioned and the spend -- the marketing spend this year versus last, I mean, is this significant as far as what's going into the business in fiscal '13 versus last year?", "Robert P. Ryder", "No, I'd say the cost of goods sold increase on a percentage basis is less than CPI. So it's, say, 1% to 2% kind of rate, and marketing spend in fiscal '13 will not be much more than the marketing spend in fiscal '12.", "Lauren Torres - HSBC, Research Division", "So the volume growth that you're expecting, I don't know if you mentioned, is it similar to low to mid-single-digit or mid-single-digit for this year at Crown? Like you said, that's coming from volume growth. So in your sense, is that being supported just by more investment, new brand instructions, more draft? What's driving that growth? If we saw such a good year last year, why should we expect the same this year?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Well, I think we've got some good momentum in the marketplace from some pretty good media spend. We -- our weight in media has increased because of our big marketing increases in both fiscal '11 and fiscal '12. Specifically, Modelo Especial has some great momentum if you look at IRI. I mean it's growing double digits. The import Beer business, in general, is quite robust. So we feel that, that growth will continue into next year, and that's why we give the guidance of say, low single-digit net sales growth for next year. I think that it's just less than fiscal '12 because we're overlapping the very successful introduction and rollout of Victoria and the Corona Familiar, which is a 32-ounce Corona Extra mostly targeted at the convenience store channel, where that brand has helped us gain a lot of share in the convenience channel.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of D.A. Davidson.", "Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Just following up on the commentary on the higher depletion growth in the fourth quarter being somewhat related to the channel. I mean, normally, we think about depletions as being a fairly sanitized number. So what was going on at the retailer level to build inventory there? Were you offering promotions through your distribution system that caused inventory build at the retail level or can you characterize that?", "Robert Sands", "Sure, Tim. What we said was that the channel sale was related primarily to the distribution of new products. So when you put new products in, right, the first step is getting the new product from the distributor to the retailer, which doesn't necessarily or, in fact, doesn't at all, reflect consumer takeaway. Right? So when you got a big new product pipeline, you're going to have some channel sales from the distributor to the retailer. That's what we were talking about.", "Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Got you, okay. And then just relating back to an earlier question. Can you be more specific about what you plan to do with terming out a portion of your debt? It would be helpful for our modeling because I think that, of course, was the big variance for most folks in terms of their outlook versus what you said today.", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, I mean, I think, essentially, what we'll be doing, Tim, is -- and you see this with a lot of your other companies that the debt markets are quite robust. There's a lot of demand for less-than-investment grade paper, and we would be included in that. So we're going to take advantage of the rate environment and refinance our bank debt and also access the senior note market. So the -- we think with senior notes, we can get very good rates on, say, 8- to 10-year paper, which we'll be very happy to have, I think, as the interest rates go up going into the future. This gives us quite a bit of liquidity and gives us a good staggered tenure on our debt portfolio.", "Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "I get all of that. But do you have a way of kind of telling us the size of that, Bob, or is it something like $1 billion?", "Robert P. Ryder", "No, we don't know. We have to wait until we go into the marketplace.", "Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. What size were you thinking of when you issued $210 million to $220 million in interest expense guidance?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, again, Tim, you just have to wait until we issue our papers around that. Now remember, there's also the stuff that is out there is -- I mentioned in my comments, that we'll have a full year of our interest rate swap next year versus only a partial year in fiscal '12, so that will increase interest expense. And we also financed much of the Ruffino purchase with euro-denominated debt. So we'll have a full year of that debt year-over-year as well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brett Cooper of Consumer Edge Research.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "Just a quick question. If you guys are investing the business in '13 and you're accelerating innovation, why is it that we shouldn't expect a step-up in the growth rate versus your long-term targets?", "Robert Sands", "Well, I think that in general, there's a lot of things going on in the portfolio. Yes, there will be a step-up in growth rates related to innovation. There's also the tactical end of our portfolio, which we manage in a different basis. So we're generally planning on growing in line with the market. Now when we say that, innovation is very robust in the market. So if you look at what percentage of the growth in the market is related to innovation, it's very high. So basically, we're going to be matching that. And in general, we expect, being the largest premium plus wine player, that we'll grow in line with the premium plus category.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "Great. And then just one follow-up. If the U.S. industry is more likely to be in shortage in the coming years, can you just talk about your, I guess, confidence and ability to offset rising input costs, basically to get back to the question of being able to grow EBIT at or above sales growth?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, if you've been reading the industry newspapers, you're right. The U.S. wine harvest was less than it was the previous year. And as you know, the U.S. wine growth is still robust. Consumers want more growth. So there's more people chasing fewer grapes. We are obviating some of those issues because of some of the initiatives we undertook 2 or 3 years ago to consolidate our wineries, consolidate our bottling lines, and our winemakers have done a lot of fantastic work in reducing the costs of our wines without impacting the quality. So I think the benefits of those initiatives will be offsetting most of the increase in the cost per ton of grapes that did actually happen in this year's harvest and most likely will happen again in next year's harvest.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Reza Vahabzadeh of Barclays.", "Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital Inc.", "Just on the leverage target, you mentioned 3x to 4x in FY '13. Is that the same leverage target from thereon as well?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, on a longer-term basis, we expect to stay within 3x to 4x EBITDA leverage ratio.", "Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital Inc.", "Got it. And then did you just comment on on-premise sales for Crown, as well as your wine and spirits portfolio?", "Robert Sands", "Yes, we did. We said that we gained share in both on- and off-premise for Crown.", "Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital Inc.", "And is that channel improving, strengthening from where you sit?", "Robert Sands", "Yes, we think that the on-premise channel is definitely strengthening with the improvement in the economy. Right now, I'd say that as we moved into 2012, off-premise channel is growing low single digits from flat to down in previous years, flat last year, down prior to that.", "Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital Inc.", "Got it. And then you talked about productivity savings in the base business last couple of years. Is there more to go here in FY '13 and '14?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, we're constantly looking at productivity measures. I think in some of the comments we talked about, some shared service activities, it will be looking at -- that will be getting productivity and we're constantly looking certainly, as I mentioned, in the cost of goods sold area, most of our operations guys wake up in the morning thinking of productivity measures. So that's an ongoing initiative that we have.", "Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital Inc.", "But the rate of realization of the productivity savings, is that going to moderate from last couple of years?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, I would say it will moderate because we've had some pretty dramatic reductions over the last 2 or 3 years.", "Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital Inc.", "Right. And then on the cost of goods inflation, you mentioned low single digits, a couple of percent on the Crown side. What's the rate of cost inflation in FY '13 for the wine and spirits portfolio?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, our operating costs in the wine business, because of our productivity initiatives, we expect cost per case to be just up slightly.", "Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital Inc.", "Got it. So that's net of savings?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Pardon?", "Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays Capital Inc.", "That's net of your savings?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes. Yes, that's net of everything. That's all in.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I guess, a few topics, firstly, with SVEDKA. Can you give us some numbers there, where we are in terms of portion of mix that is SVEDKA and how that brand did in the latest quarter?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, I mean, SVEDKA for fiscal '12 grew. You see in IRI, it grew quite robustly. Depletions were still up double digits and total volumes are just short of 4 million cases.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And how did it do in the latest quarter?", "Robert P. Ryder", "The fourth quarter was similar to that. Actually, like the other products in the fourth quarter, it actually did better than its full year number.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Got it, great. Okay, and then just changing topics. Bob, as we think about this free cash flow delta, the $425 million to $475 million and the long-term objective being $500 million plus. How much -- there's obviously a lot of moving parts here in the coming fiscal year, but on the -- and you mentioned inventory drag in your prepared remarks, kind of higher level of inventory. Can you give us a number there? How -- are we talking $10 million, $20 million, $30 million? Can you just give us either...", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, I'd say, Mark, we've gotten -- with all the initiatives in our operations function, we've gotten quite a bit of inventory, which you can see in our free cash flow, out of the business over the last 2 years. I'd say, what happened in fiscal '12 is the harvest came in a little bit light. Okay? And our volumes came in lighter than we expected, so we didn't have to buy as much bulk wine in fiscal '12, and we were able to sell-through preexisting products. So I'd say we had better inventory results in '12 than we probably should have, certainly better than we anticipated. But now what happened is since in '13, we expect to grow with the category. The wine that we didn't take in, in '12, we have to taken in, in '13, okay, to fuel the growth. And we expect absolute growth to be higher in '13 than it was in '12. So all that being said, if it were more normalized, I think our '13 guidance would have been in the $500 million range. So I'd say that inventory switch from year-to-year, it was probably worth $30 million to $50 million.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Got it. Okay, that makes sense. And staying on this topic of free cash flow and trying to think about the underlying business versus what's happening in fiscal '13. The borrowing costs are going up this year. You've talked about why and that's helpful stuff. But as we think about getting beyond the effects of the swap, getting beyond the effects of the refinancing and just assume for a moment, maybe just the constant level of absolute net debt, can you speak generally to -- again, are we talking $5 million, $10 million, $50 million? How much higher than kind of the underlying new, if you will, cap structure do you think this interest expense guidance of $210 million to $220 million, is it above the underlying number or do you think the underlying really, it's representative of the underlying number?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Well, I think the number that we're giving for next year will reflect the average borrowings for the year and the average rates for this year. Now it will depend if we buy a lot of stock back, I would expect our principal balance to go up. If we do an acquisition, I would expect our principal balance to go up. But the plan now is to issue senior notes, which will be fixed rate, and to refinance the bank debt. But because the swap, actually most of our bank debt is also fixed. So the rates, when we come out with the loan paper, should be pretty well known. And it will depend how much we tap into the revolver, the new revolver that we will be issuing in fiscal '13.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Got it, okay. And then I don't know if it's you Bob or Rob, but just thinking about the business itself and this question Judy raised and kind of -- and perhaps just kind of this issue of when do we get to kind of a sweeter spot, so to speak. What in your opinion -- is it a moment in time? Is it a change in the way you run your business? Is it something happening out there in the marketplace? Because this cycle of growth but it's going to cost you has been going on for quite a while. So is there something you're seeing either up in the marketplace or in the way you run your business that makes you think, okay, you get to the end of fiscal '13 and we're really going to be in a sweeter spot?", "Robert Sands", "Yes, I think that you could say that we will be in a sweeter spot. But first and foremost, the important thing is to ensure that our business is healthy, our brands are strong, that we've got the right products within our brands to take advantage of the trends in the marketplace. That's the first thing that we need to make sure is the case. And we've been working on that and actually quite successfully throughout last year, and we'll continue to work on that this year. As I said to Judy, I do expect that we will be able to leverage that into EBIT growth. So no, it's not a point in time, and we'll have to continue to keep our eye on the market and make sure that we're successful in our brand building activities. But I would say that we should be able to see a pretty positive result relative to that in the relatively short term, talking beyond FY '13. Now obviously, there's been a lot of improvement in the business. We've streamlined our portfolio. We've functionalized the business. We've improved our go-to-market strategy. Our free cash flow results have been, I think, quite stellar, and we've significantly reduced debt. So you're already seeing a lot of the benefits of our activities, as well as our return of value to our shareholders with over $700 million of stock repurchases over the last 2 years and another $1 billion announced with this release. So I think that there's been a huge amount of positive progress.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then finally, as we think about where this incremental spending is going, you've called out some specific activities, China, new products, some national TV, I believe, new campaign for SVEDKA. Is there any way to sort of just give us a sense of relative emphasis? I mean, China, for example, obviously, a market that's growing and has a lot of potential. But as we think about you're looking at your total spend budget this coming fiscal year versus the past, how do we rank or how do you rank where those new dollars are going?", "Robert Sands", "Well, I think they're going into the things that you mentioned. Those are exactly the items that are driving increased expense. So it's SVEDKA advertising. It's television advertising campaigns on Black Box, on Simply Naked. SVEDKA, as you mentioned, it's more investment to build the business in China. So those are the major items.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And is there anyone that stands out larger in terms of year-on-year increase versus the other? Is it evenly spread?", "Robert Sands", "Yes, it's evenly spread. I mean, it's a bit here, a bit there so.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Gary Albanese of Auriga.", "Gary Albanese - Auriga USA LLC, Research Division", "Just going back to the taxes. I know you mentioned the 34% expected rate. Are there any more potential tax benefits that are being negotiated or is that all resolved now?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Look, we're always working on new stuff, and they all have different levels of probabilities. 34% rate for next year, I think, has our highest level of probability. But we're already planning for things in '14 and '15. So hopefully, they'll come to fruition. But at -- remember, we are primarily a North American business. So actually, a 34% effective tax rate for a strictly North American business, especially heavily weighted towards high-tax states, is actually a pretty good rate.", "Gary Albanese - Auriga USA LLC, Research Division", "Okay, okay. And just going back to the working capital, the expectations for usage -- uses for this year. Are you able to quantify what the expected use is going to be?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Well, when you say usage, I mean the big swing...", "Gary Albanese - Auriga USA LLC, Research Division", "In terms of the amount.", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, I won't give numbers. But the big swing is going to be in the inventory line item. Okay? Because we've seen some pretty good performance in inventories, actually, over the last 2 or 3 years. And I think next year, there's a bit of a catch-up because we probably had a bit too much of positives in fiscal '12. Because remember in fiscal '12, we generated over $700 million of free cash flow. That's quite a number for a business our size. So there's a bit of catch-up on inventories in '13. I think also interest -- cash interest will be higher in '13 because of the refinancing. So outside of taxes, it will be in inventories and interest.", "Gary Albanese - Auriga USA LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And just regarding on Victoria, can you talk about the rollout, how far -- how much is it, how far has it been rolled out in terms of the coverage in domestically and how much you expect it to be rolled out this year?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, I'd say, we've -- geographically, I think right now, we're going to take a pause. It's been rolled out to all of the large states that we anticipate. And really the strategy was Victoria is a very well known and one of the oldest beer brands in Mexico, so the strategy was to roll it out in cities where the Mexican consumer would recognize the brand and would have very good sell-through. I think on a go-forward basis, we're taking a little bit more pause as far as what geographies we would roll it out to because I think, so far, it was P&L positive right off the bat because the consumer knew what it was. To roll it out in additional cities where the brand is not as well-known will take a lot more investment, so we're thinking of that more carefully.", "Gary Albanese - Auriga USA LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. Just one last thing, when do expect to file your K, your 10-K?", "Robert P. Ryder", "I believe it's going to be in the end of April.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Dreyer of Gabelli Asset Management.", "Kevin V. Dreyer - GAMCO Investors, Inc.", "Just curious about Crown. Is there any update or what's your thinking or expectation regarding that business going forward? Are you going to be trying to negotiate over the next year or so for an extension of the agreement? I think -- correct me if I'm wrong, but they have -- they would have to notify you by the end of 2013 if they were planning to do something different with that business?", "Robert Sands", "Yes, they have to notify us at the end of that in 2013, which is 3 years in advance of the end of the contract of what their intention is relative to the end of the contract. So that's still 1 3/4 year off, and then there's 3 years left on the contract, which means that there's almost 5 years left on the contract. So I think it's premature to really know what any of the parties' intentions are in that regard.", "Kevin V. Dreyer - GAMCO Investors, Inc.", "Okay. And just about the wine industry generally,  I'm curious with the repurchase announcement. Do you expect further consolidation in the industry over the next year or 2? And if so, would you plan to participate in that?", "Robert Sands", "Yes, I'd say we would expect to see some further consolidation in the industry. There's been some deals that have been done. Our primary use of free cash flow, as we have indicated, is that -- is now really to focus on our stock buyback program. So we also have capacity if a strategic acquisition comes along that we think that fits well in the portfolio, it meets our financial criterion, we have the capacity to continue to buy back stock and do that as well. So it really depends on what opportunities are out there, so maybe is the answer to that question. But in the interim, our primary focus is going to be on the stock buyback program and returning cash therefore to shareholders in that form.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just -- I wanted to ask your view on -- relative to, I guess, where you're expecting the industry to grow this year. Is there a pricing expectation built into your growth assumptions for the industry? And then, is there any pricing embedded in your own revenue assumptions for fiscal '13?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, Bryan, this is Bob. We did not bake any pricing into our guidance. The wine category continues to be relatively promotional versus the other beverage alcohol. And as far as the growth for the industry, we're assuming it's low to mid-single digits.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So your base case is that the industry will kind of -- will remain the same in terms of the trade-off for the balance between volume and pricing?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Well, yes, but remember the industry always tends to experience positive mix shifts. So we can still expect net sales to grow higher than volumes. But right now, we're not anticipating any increase in pricing.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then based on the comments that you had made earlier with regards to your -- I guess, your net inflation, your inflation being offset to some degree by -- or almost fully offset by productivity. Is -- there's not a real need from your end at least over the next 12 months to raise prices to cover your cost of goods inflation. Is that correct?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Well, again, it's -- I wish it were that formulaic, right, because there's a lot of competitors out there with different motivations. So we're assuming that we won't be able to price, and we've got to offset our own inflation because we are focused on growing EBIT.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Right. I guess what I'm driving is, is it just given you're seeing some tightness in supply, not just on grapes, but even in bulk wine, there's some tightness in supply in California right now. And we're beginning to see or hear that some of your competitors, especially at the value end, you're starting to see some price increases get pushed through. And that -- to the extent that the industry, there's some pricing in the industry, is it right to think about your plan as you've got some flexibility with regards to whether or not you'd follow? And if there is some benefit to be derived from pricing, that's sort of upside to your base case. Is that the right way to think about I?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, I mean, obviously, we're -- like all the other wine competitors, we're keeping a close eye on what each other is doing. And it's a constant balance between pricing and volumes, right, so -- and market share. So we'll keep a close eye on it. We're not anticipating price increases because remember, depending on the product and the price point, the bulk wine that's bought, how long is it before it hits the cost of goods sold line? And that depends on the aging and the price point of the wine. But we have a lot of people keeping a close eye on what's going on in the market, and we're constantly balancing those priorities.", "Operator", "And that concludes our Q&A session for today. I'll now turn the call back over to Rob Sands for any closing remarks.", "Robert Sands", "Well, thanks for joining our call today. And as I have indicated, I am very pleased with the progress that we've made throughout the past year in terms of improving our financial profile and the areas of free cash flow generation, debt reduction and margin improvement. In addition, we have strong marketplace momentum for our Crown beer business, as well as our U.S. wine and spirits business, which positions us well for fiscal 2013. Our new products are being well received in the marketplace, and we are planning several new initiatives in this area throughout the coming year. Our plan for fiscal 2013 is to continue to execute on our strategic initiatives and driving profitable organic growth. ", "We will be on the road frequently throughout the months of April and May, and Bob and I look forward to seeing many of you.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Constellation Brands First Quarter and Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Patty Yahn-Urlaub", "Thank you, Jackie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Constellation's first quarter fiscal 2013 conference call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer.", "This call complements our news release, which has also been furnished to the SEC.", "During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP, comparable, organic and constant-currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com under the Investors section in Financial History.", "Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may affect the company's estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings.", "And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.", "Robert S. Sands", "Thanks, Patty. And good morning, and welcome to our call. This has certainly been an exciting week for us. First and foremost, by announcing earlier today that we intend to purchase the remaining 50% of Crown from ABI, we are enhancing our participation in the U.S. beer market, which is one of the most attractive sectors of the beverage alcohol industry. The structure of this transaction will solidify our place in this market for the long-term and most importantly will remove the uncertainty that, we believe, has created a significant overhang related to the valuation of our stock. Crown is the #1 beer importer in the U.S. where it has the exclusive right to import, market and sell the Modelo brands, which include Corona Extra, Corona Light, Modelo Especial, Pacifico, Negra Modelo and Victoria.", "This transaction represents a significant milestone in the history of the company and the next transformational step in the evolution of our business as it will give Constellation 100% ownership of the import, sales and marketing business for the Modelo brands currently being sold in the U.S. This will also solidify Constellation's position as the largest multi-category supplier for beer, wine and spirits and the third-largest total beverage alcohol company in the U.S. on a volume basis.", "Crown will have complete, independent control as a brand owner with respect to distribution, marketing, promotion and pricing. ABI will be responsible for ensuring the continuity of supply and quality of products as well as providing the ability to introduce innovation, although they will have no visibility or future influence on marketing, distribution or pricing.", "Bill Hackett and the Crown team have built an absolutely phenomenal business driven by their strength in brand building and the strong relationships they have established with distributors and retailers in the marketplace. This is a perpetual agreement that has an initial term of 10 years and renews automatically for subsequent 10-year terms. In addition, ABI has the right, but not the obligation, to exercise a call option at a multiple of 13x EBIT for the Grupo Modelo brands, approximately one year prior to the expiration of any 10-year term subject to regulatory approval.", "This arrangement will dramatically enhance Constellation's financial profile as it will result in the full consolidation of Crown's financial results within Constellation's existing business model upon closing. Bob will have specifics related to the funding of the deal and the high-level financial implications for Constellation in just a few moments.", "In the wine business, we are also pleased to announce today that we are purchasing the Mark West brand, which represents a synergistic, high-growth, complementary tuck-in to our existing portfolio of wine brands.", "Mark West is primarily a California pinot noir that is priced in the $10 to $12 price range at retail. In 2011, Mark West sold nearly 600,000 cases in the U.S. marketplace. It is currently the top-selling pinot noir brand experiencing nearly 35% volume growth in the SymphonyIRI channel.", "As you know, we have successful -- we have a successful track record of integrating high-growth, strong-momentum brands, and I am excited by the prospect of adding Mark West to our brand family.", "And now I'd like to just -- to focus our discussion on our first quarter operational results. We are off to a good start for the year with results that were generally in line with our expectations. Highlights for the first quarter include: the purchase of almost 70% of our targeted share buybacks for the year; great momentum for the Crown beer business; strong consumer takeaway trends for our U.S. wine and spirits business; the completion of the next phase of our U.S. distribution consolidation effort with the signing of exclusive multiyear agreements with additional U.S. distributors, covering almost 10% of our U.S. wine and spirits volume. Collectively, we now have almost 70% of our U.S. wine and spirits business covered by exclusive distributor arrangements.", "We continue to focus on developing, launching and promoting our new products and existing focus brands in the marketplace, which, to date, have received great reception by consumers. Some examples include the recently launched 4 varietals for our new Thorny Rose brand, which is specifically targeted to millennials who contributed to the development of this brand. This generation is creating a brand that is tailored to their life stage as they enter the wine category. A new summer TV campaign kicks off as we speak for Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. This innovating advertising positions Woodbridge as the catalyst for creating moments for sharing.", "The TV advertising is well supported by new line extensions, in-store retail support and online engagement with our rapidly growing Facebook community, and is expected to drive trial during the busy summer selling season. The Black Box national TV advertising campaign was launched Memorial Day weekend, which showcases this family of wines, delivering the quality of premium wine in a bottle with the value of a box.", "We launched nationally Arbor Mist Frozen Wine Cocktails in 3 flavors: Blackberry Merlot, White Pear Pinot Grigio, and Strawberry White Zinfandel. Arbor Mist is a top 20 wine brand by Volume in the U.S., demanding more than 80% market share of the wine with fruit category.", "Ready-to-drink pouches is one of the fastest growing segments in the U.S., experiencing more than 180% volume growth in the past year in SymphonyIRI channels. The new SVEDKA advertising campaign debuted this quarter, appearing on the top national cable TV stations and popular websites. In addition, we recently announced the expansion of SVEDKA's flavored portfolio with Colada, a unique and refreshing blend of coconut-flavored vodka, pineapple and mango. For the quarter, SVEDKA posted market growth of almost 20% in addition to gaining volume share of the vodka category.", "We also recently launched a new flavor for our Black Box, Velvet -- our Black Velvet Canadian Whisky. Toasted caramel is a unique, versatile, delicious addition to our spirits portfolio. Flavored whiskeys are currently on fire in the marketplace, growing at a rate of more than 120% in calendar 2011.", "These are just a few examples of the brand investments that we are making this year. Although we had a slow start to the year from a depletion perspective, our overall depletion trends improved as we progressed through the quarter as our marketing and promotional efforts gained traction in the marketplace. And in May, our depletion trends exceeded industry trends. We expect positive depletion momentum to continue into the second quarter.", "Now these trends follow a strong close to our fiscal year last February when we launched several new products at year-end. You may remember that some of that strong fourth quarter depletion performance was driven by selling of new products to distributor and retail channels, which we indicated would unfavorably impact our sales and depletion performance in the first quarter. While this has taken some time to work through the system, the great programming we put in place during the first quarter helped pull through volume to consumers, which you are seeing in our very strong SymphonyIRI trends.", "Overall, we are growing in line with the total U.S. wine and spirits industry across all channels at a first quarter growth rate of about 4%. Remember, we may remain committed to growing in line with the U.S. wine and spirits industry growth for fiscal 2013 and beyond.", "Now moving to the Crown Imports joint venture. The first quarter marked the ninth consecutive quarter that Crown has outperformed the total U.S. beer industry and the import category, both on- and off-premise channels. Crown continues to build on the exceptional momentum generated last year, posting depletions in the high single-digit range in the first quarter. This is the result of several key initiatives including the Corona Win Your Beach retail promotion, which was very successful during last year's summer season.", "It is bigger and better this year, offering consumers more ways to enter and more chances to win prizes of their choice to fit their preferred beach experience. This promotion is accompanied by a new Win Your Beach TV spot.", "The new Corona Light campaign debuted in April and is centered on being the beer that breaks consumer free from their boring routine, offering a refreshing change of pace.", "Corona Extra has extended the Find Your Beach advertising campaign with new creative, supplemented by a combined TV, digital and social media campaign.", "I'd like to bring your attention to the fact that Corona Extra posted depletion trends of more than 5% during the first quarter, which is quite a turnaround story for this brand. It is the result of Crown's relentless focus on the brand, especially in on-premise channels where Crown has done an excellent job of expanding distribution.", "Crown also benefited from unusually warm weather in March and favorable timing of the Cinco de Mayo and Memorial Day holidays.", "In closing, today's exciting announcements, coupled with solid execution of first quarter results, demonstrate that we continue to deliver on our key strategic imperatives, which, I believe, will drive the achievement of our one common goal: profitable organic growth.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our first quarter business results.", "Robert P. Ryder", "Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. There's a lot of exciting news to speak about today. In addition to Q1 results, we also have 2 acquisitions to discuss for which I'm sure you have many questions. So let me briefly provide some details on our first quarter P&L performance where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results, so I can then provide some financial details around the transactions outlined by Rob. And then we'll discuss our full year outlook.", "Our comparable basis diluted EPS for Q1 came in at $0.40. At a high level, this result was generally in line with our expectations and puts us on track to meet our EPS goal for the year. EBIT was down 4%, which was slightly better than the range we discussed on our last earnings call. Our weighted average shares came in better than planned while our effective tax rate came in a little higher than expected just due to timing.", "As you can see from our news release, wine and spirits net sales, on an organic constant currency basis, decreased 1% as higher promotional costs and a decrease in volume were mostly offset by positive mix. As Rob mentioned, we had some timing items holding back shipment and depletion growth for the quarter.", "Now let's look at our profits on a comparable basis. For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 39.6%, which was essentially level with the prior year. This primarily reflects the increase in promotion costs offset by the favorable product mix.", "I'd now like to discuss the segment operating income results to provide highlights of our operating income change.", "Wine and spirits segment operating income decreased $4 million to $133 million, primarily due to the higher promotional spending along with marketing investments. Corporate costs increased $2 million, primarily due to our technology investments.", "Consolidated equity earnings totaled $61 million versus $62 million last year. This includes a reduction for consolidating Ruffino in Q1 versus equity accounting treatment in Q1 last year.", "For the quarter, Crown generated sales of $724 million, an increase of 7%; and operating income of $123 million, an increase of 3%. The net sales increase was primarily driven by volume growth of Modelo Especial and Corona Extra. A timing-related increase in marketing and the contractual cost-of-goods increase drove operating income growth below sales growth.", "Interest expense for the quarter was $51 million, up 14% versus the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher average debt balances and an increase in average interest rates.", "To better help frame in the drivers of the interest increase, let me discuss our debt position, share purchases and recently financing activity. At the end of May, our debt totaled $3.4 billion. This represents a $292 million increase from our debt level at the end of fiscal 2012. The increase was driven by our share repurchases, net of the free cash flow generation during the quarter.", "During Q1, we repurchased 18 million shares at a cost of $383 million. That's an average cost of $21.28 a share. Versus prior year, we have reduced our Q1 weighted average share count by 25 million shares or 11%. This represents a significant return to shareholders for our improved cash flow generation.", "During the first quarter, we took advantage of our improved credit profile and the attractive interest rate environment to refinance our senior credit facility and issue $600 million of 6% 10-year senior notes. Proceeds from the note issuance were effectively used to reduce borrowings under our senior credit facility and to fund the share repurchases. The new senior credit facility includes an $850 million revolving credit facility and $800 million term loans, which effectively replaced our previous term loans. The revolver and term loans are generally tied to LIBOR plus a margin. The margin is a grid based on the grid centering on margins in the 1.75 to 2.0 range.", "At the end of the quarter, borrowings under our revolver were approximately $26 million. Our average interest rate for Q1 was approximately 6%, which was about 0.5% higher than Q1 last year. The rate increase reflects the senior note issuance I just outlined.", "Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 36% compared to a 37% rate for Q1 last year. We are still targeting an effective tax rate of 34% for the full year.", "Now let's discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For Q1, we generated free cash flow of $77 million versus $220 million for the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to the receipt of tax refunds in the prior year's first quarter that were primarily driven by the sale of our U.K. business. We are continuing to target free cash flow for fiscal 2013 in the range of $425 million to $475 million. This includes CapEx in the $70 million to $80 million range.", "Before reviewing our fiscal 2013 P&L outlook, let me provide some financial highlights related to the Mark West and Crown transactions.", "For Mark West, we expect to finance the $160 million purchase price with borrowings under our revolver. On an annual basis, this brand has been selling nearly 600,000 cases in the $10 to $12 price range at retail and generating net sales of about $35 million at a margin profile higher than the average of our current U.S. wine business. We expect the transaction to close in July and estimate the acquisition to be slightly accretive to diluted EPS for fiscal 2013.", "We are only buying the brand, inventory and some grape supply contracts, so we do not expect any meaningful integration costs.", "The acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Crown Imports is truly transformational and represents a significant milestone in our history and participation in the beer business. The incorporation of Crown's strong business and financial model will dramatically enhance the financial profile of Constellation.", "During fiscal 2012, Crown sold 164 million cases and generated $2.47 billion of net sales and $431 million of EBIT. We currently account for a 50% interest in Crown under the equity method and recognize $215 million of equity earnings from Crown in fiscal '12.", "Upon completion of the transaction, which is expected sometime during the first quarter of calendar 2013, we will begin consolidating the full financial results of Crown. As a result, we will be layering in 100% of Crown's sales and earnings throughout our income statement.", "The Crown business is very complementary to our wine and spirits business. It has strong financial profile with similar absolute sales dollars and EBIT margins. It diversifies our consumer base and allows us to fully participate as a major competitor in the U.S. beer industry. With low working capital and fixed asset needs, it has an even higher operating return on invested capital profile than wine and spirits and is a very strong cash flow generator. It has a strong and prudent management team with whom we have worked closely for a very long time. And the business is currently experiencing very positive momentum.", "We do not expect to incur any meaningful integration costs related to the transaction. Our cost of debt for this specific transaction will be in the 4% to 4.5% interest rate range with a tax rate in the 35% to 37% range for this transaction. The transaction is expected to be significantly accretive to annual diluted EPS and free cash flow.", "From a financing perspective, we have fully committed bridge financing in place to complete the acquisition. Permanent financing of a $1.8 billion purchase price is expected to consist of a combination of revolver borrowings, our new term loan under our existing senior credit facility and the issuance of senior notes. Depending on market conditions, some of the permanent financing may be put in place and drawn prior to transaction close.", "As a result, we could see some incremental interest expense and banking fees before the deal closes.", "At the end of May, our debt-to-comparable basis EBITDA ratio was 3.9x. Exclusive of the Crown transaction, we expect this measure to be around the mid-3x range at fiscal year end. The Crown transaction is expected to increase this ratio to the mid-4x range when factoring in a full year of additional Crown EBITDA. With our strong free cash flow generation, leverage should decrease back into our targeted ratio of 3x to 4x EBITDA within the first 12 months after the close of the transaction.", "Given the funding requirements just outlined, we plan to suspend our share repurchase program. The $1 billion share repurchase authorization approved by the Board of Directors this past April continues to be in effect with approximately $700 million of repurchase availability remaining.", "As outlined earlier, we purchased $383 million of stock during Q1. This represents nearly 70% of our original fiscal '13 share repurchase target of $550 million to $600 million.", "Since we are able to buy such a significant amount of stock so early in the year, we are maintaining our fiscal '13 weighted average share estimate of 185 million to 190 million shares even though we do not expect to repurchase any additional shares in fiscal '13.", "Now for a full year 2013 P&L outlook. We are continuing to forecast comparable basis diluted EPS guidance to be in the range of $1.93 to $2.03 per share. This includes the acquisition of the Mark West brand, but excludes any impact from the anticipated purchase of the remaining 50% interest in Crown. For now, we are also continuing to target interest expense in the range of $210 million to $220 million a year.", "I would like to note that from a gaining perspective, we expect fiscal 2013 Q2 EBIT performance to come in below Q2 of fiscal 2012 by a mid single-digit percentage. The reasons for the expected reduction are similar to what we experienced in Q1 and are due to an increase in promotional spending. As a reminder, we're making promotional spending investments in the first half of the year to support new products and provide a more even distribution of promotional expense throughout fiscal 2013 versus fiscal 2012, which was heavily weighted to the second half of the year. This should drive continued portfolio momentum going into the key October, November, December holiday selling season.", "In addition, we expect Q2 to be impacted by the timing of U.S. marketing expense as we support new products and launch a new national advertising campaign for Woodbridge, Black Box and Kim Crawford during the summer.", "Our comparable basis guidance excludes restructuring charges and unusual items, which are detailed on the last page of the release.", "Before we take your questions, I would like to summarize by saying Q1 represents a very good start to the year, and we're on track to achieving our financial goals. We're seeing solid consumer takeaway trends for our U.S. wine and spirits business with good energy around new products and initiatives supporting our focus brands.", "On the beer side, strong marketing programs and execution at retail continue to drive excellent marketplace performance and improved earnings.", "The Mark West brand has a good growth profile and will be a nice addition to our wine portfolio.", "And finally, by purchasing the remaining 50% interest in the Crown beer business, we will significantly strengthen our U.S. market position in beverage alcohol and our overall financial profile.", "We also feel that pending the close of this transaction, the perpetuity of the beer business has become quite clear: we are much happier participating in the beer category on a perpetual basis than receiving an 8x multiple buyout at the end of calendar 2016. We feel our shareholders should also be pleased. We had 100% of the powerful consumer franchise and 100% of the excellent financial model that currently exist at Crown. We financed the acquisition in favorable market conditions and de-lever to pre-Crown acquisition levels within the first 12 months. And we eliminate the speculation around the perpetuity of our exclusive importer agreement.", "We hope this provides the opportunity for Constellation's valuation to be more in line with our beverage alcohol peers.", "With that, we're happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]  Your first question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So first on the Crown, the new agreement. So just in terms of the terms of the contract, I know ABI said the spirits of the new contracts are pretty similar in terms of the existing one that you have with Modelo, but can you just walk us through any changes in terms of the terms of the new contract versus the old one?", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes, Judy. Basically, the new contract was generally designed to preserve the economics of the old contract. So in terms of how Crown will operate or the economics, there's really no significant or material changes to that.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Do you still have that COGS increase every year that you'll be facing?", "Robert S. Sands", "The specific contractual provisions in the new contract with regards to Crown with regard to COGS increases. But again, the contract was designed to preserve the economics of the -- our current agreement.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then I guess we can kind of walk through the financial accretion based on some of the details that you've given us, Bob. But I guess in terms of strategic perspective and as you think about the Crown business longer term, can you give us some perspective on how you think about sales growth, EBIT growth, potential going forward for the business? And then do you envision also adding more brands into this portfolio? And whether that includes maybe other imports or craft brands to really expand the beer business within Constellation?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, I'll answer the first half of that and I'll let Rob answer the second half. So from an economic perspective, we're very happy with Crown's market share performance and its actually core depletion performance. We would expect, going forward now, that we control 100% of the business, and its future from our perspective is perpetual. I think that we would hope to get EBIT growth doing better than it has historically. And we'll be focused on that. And I think the current momentum that the Crown business had established will certainly help EBIT growth as we move into fiscal '14 and beyond. Let me let Rob answer the second half.", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes, so you talked about -- your question was on new brands and innovation and things to that effect. I think that, number one, under the new agreements with ABI, we've secured a good innovation pipeline from Mexico. And then secondly, there is no restrictions on what we're able to do with non-Mexican beer brands. So in other words, we can add either through organic development or otherwise any new non-Mexican beer brands that we wish, so we don't have any restrictions in that regard. So clearly, with the 100% ownership of the Crown business and the ability to entirely control that business, just like our wine and spirits business, we'll be looking at the beer business very similarly to how we look at the wine business as it relates to our innovation and new product plans.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, Bob, just clarification on the leverage. So the mid-4x with Crown, the 100% of Crown, that assumes that you suspend the buyback as of today or pretty recent and then -- so you get the cash flow contribution for the year, but basically adding the $1.85 billion of debt. So you're assuming that the buyback stops in the 4 -- mid-4s?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, that's correct. And Judy, that assumes a full year of Crown EBITDA. So we think when the deal closes, if you assume the full year Crown EBITDA will be around 4.5, and within 12 months will be well below 4x EBITDA. And from -- and it assumes that -- all our calculations assume, including any accretion that you guys do, the incremental financing from the $1.85 billion.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Right. And when leverage then comes back down to kind of your targeted level, is it your intention to then resume buyback at that point?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, I mean, we still have the authorization. So I think at that point, we're happy because we've got a lot of financial flexibility to do pretty much anything we want around the capital structure. So I think all of that should bode well for our shareholders. Because, again, Crown is a very strong cash flow generator and a very consistent cash flow generator. So I think it really complements quite nicely the wine and spirits business. We were lucky to be in a category that's very consistent in pretty much all economic scenarios. And right now, beer in IRI is doing quite well, spirits is doing quite well and wine is doing quite well. So it's pretty good times for beverage alcohol.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with UBS.", "Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I guess the first thing is, over the last couple of years there have been some public disagreements on how to run the Crown business between yourselves and Modelo. So it's now fully in your control. What are some of the things that you want to see change over the next couple of years?", "Robert S. Sands", "Yeah, we don't really see that a lot of change is necessary. Obviously, the business is performing very well at the current time. Specifically, we have no intention of changing management. The current management team under Bill Hackett has done a great job and we certainly intend to leave that in place. And we see no change in distribution and the distribution network, which has also performed very well for us. So obviously, we don't have the issue hanging over us, so the 2016 date and -- so we'll be thinking about the beer business very much as we think about the wine and spirits business in terms of what investments make sense to drive the business for the future and to achieve our strategic imperative of driving profitable organic growth.", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, Kaumil, just to follow that up, I think some of the disagreements between Modelo and Constellation were probably kind of natural given how the contract was set up and how both parties were looking at duration. I think part of the reason that you saw a different buyout multiple for us, meaning like 8.5x, and a different exit multiple, say 13x, is I think InBev really wants us to really think like a long-term brand owner of the Corona brand in the U.S. And a 13x exit multiple is kind of like a perpetuity multiple, right? So they really want us to have that kind of mindset. So I think going forward, we'll have a very similar mindset. We'll be thinking very long term.", "Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Got it. Well, if I could also -- considering long term, I think 2 things: one is the idea of potentially importing other brands from around the world and putting it into Crown. But I also want to add, is there also opportunity to pick up -- to maybe better leverage your sales resources by picking up domestic brands?", "Robert S. Sands", "So there's no limitation on our ability to add brands whether imported or domestic with the exception of Mexican brands, okay? Modelo will continue to be our exclusive supplier of Mexican brands, but there -- but other than that, there's no limitation on what we can add in the Crown business or as part as of the Crown portfolio.", "Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "All right. So is it possible to think about that business, that maybe we can justify a step-up of investment because the opportunities are broader than they were prior?", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes. Well, it's premature for us really to address that. But as I said, we'll be looking at that business almost in the exact same way that we look at our wine and spirits business and making decisions as to where we want to invest to get the best return from our investment dollars. And we're a very disciplined company in that regard and we're very focused on ROIC. So it's basically no different than any other part of our business. And it's a great business. More importantly, the imported beer business is very strong. We've got the best brands in that business and we've got a fantastic platform with the Crown management team. And our distribution network for Crown is, we think, the strongest in the business. So we're very positive about the future opportunities there.", "Robert P. Ryder", "So, but let me be clear, when we're saying -- when Rob and I are saying \"long term,\" right, we're not going to be sacrificing short-term profitability. We are focused, as Rob said earlier, on profitable organic growth. The guidance for this year is for Crown to grow EBIT. We don't expect to come off that and we expect to grow EBIT every year. And we're just going to be prudent businessmen. So you mentioned a comment, Would we pick up distribution of domestic brands? Well, maybe, but one of the business we'd make is the Crown business has quite a strong profit margin. So we will be careful of diluting our salesmen's attention perhaps on other products that don't have the same kind of margin. So there'll be the kind of balancing acts that any company with a long-term view thinks about.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey with D.A. Davidson.", "Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Just on the cost of debt, I was a little surprised by the 4%-4.5%, particularly since you were recently issuing bonds at over 6%. Is that just the mix of revolver plus term loans that you'll be using?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, so good question, Tim. So if you think about it, our revolver, which we have $800 million or so capacity against, is, say, 2% right now, right? I mean things can change if LIBOR changes, right? So that's pretty low-cost funding. The senior notes we issued before, you're correct, we issued them at 6%. They're currently trading below 5%. So if that would be -- if we were to fund today, that might be reflective of thereabout the funding we'd get on that paper. And then also bank debt, which is LIBOR plus 200-ish. So it would be the mix of those 3, and obviously the shorter-term paper has a much lower yield, much lower interest rate, but we want to get some duration as we look at the maturities of our credits in total. So as we balance all those things out, that's when we come out about 4% or 4.5%. But of course, that's subject to when we fund and what the market rates are when we do fund.", "Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Would it be wrong to think of your credit profile actually probably being better today than it was yesterday? Just given that the debt markets would have had the same concerns about the sustainability of the JV income stream, now those questions are put to bed, your funding rate probably went down today.", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes. So actually, it's another great question, Tim. And it's not actually a question, but it's a correct statement. So if you look -- the rating agencies will be coming out. I think Moody's already came out this morning. And we don't expect any negative ramifications for that. There'll be wording, I think, in their press releases around the more permanence of the dependable beer cash flows. And if you look at how our bonds are traded, since the rumors of this transaction just started, the yields came way down. And as I said, those 6% senior notes, or the yield on those, are now below 5%. So I think what you said is exactly right. From a credit perspective, we are now in better position than we were before this transaction. Even though, as we said, our leverage will go up a little bit in the short term, but we will pay that off frequently.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just a couple of questions. First, just to follow up on the Crown transaction. Is there any goodwill amortization, or any kind of step-up in goodwill that we'll have to think about when we model -- when we plug it into our model?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, so another good question. So the way this will work -- the way this will probably work, right, the transaction hasn't closed, we haven't completely formulated all the absolutes -- is the $1.8 million, okay, that will have -- that will almost be all intangibles. Because, as you know, 100% of the Crown business has about $200 million of net assets, okay? So heavy intangible acquisition there. The fortunate piece of that is those intangibles are tax-deductible, right, so it should help the tax rate on this deal. Now the other kind of geeky GAAP thing that's going to happen here is, most likely, we're going to have to mark our existing interest in Crown to market. So what that means is we will record quite a significant gain, right, which will again increase the asset base of the Crown business. So in essence, although cash going out the door will essentially be the $1.8 billion, and most of that will be goodwill, we will also have a gain and also record more intangibles for the first half we own. So the intangible asset will go up just shy of $4 billion, more likely than not, when this thing closes.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And so then as we're just -- if we're taking a baseline EBITDA, or EBITDA for Crown of, I don't know, let's just -- just to use a round number, $450 million, we still have to -- we will have to make some adjustments for that for the increase -- or I'm sorry, EBIT, of about, let's say, $430 million, we'll have to make some adjustment for a higher amortization?", "Robert P. Ryder", "No, the amortization won't occur on the GAAP financials. We will be able to amortize it for tax purposes. And again, we haven't finished this. But my guess is a lot of the intangibles from a book perspective won't be amortizing.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then the tax benefit that would be created is included in the, what you've described, I guess, like a 36% tax rate or so to use for GAAP.", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, so that's a good point, too. Because as we said before, the Crown business, by its nature, has a pretty high tax rate because the majority of its sales are in high-tax rate districts and it has nexus in a lot of the states because of the distribution centers so it's relatively high state tax rate. But the amortization of the purchase price helps bring that tax rate down. So your statutory rate would be, I don't know, say 38%, 39%. You're back down to, say, the 35%, 36% effective tax rate, including the amortization of the purchase price.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, okay. And then are there any synergies once -- looking forward, once you've got full control of Crown, are there any -- is there any like overhead leverage and overhead things, like systems, any kind of cost synergies that are material that we should think about?", "Robert P. Ryder", "No, really not, Bryan. And because as we said, one of the glories of this acquisition is it's kind of like buying yourself, right? We've known this business for so long. We know the people. We know how good they are. We know the work they've done even before the JV was formed. And there's actually a lot of symbiosis already between that 2. As we put in our ERP system, Crown put in the same system, the same instance. So those synergies pretty much already exist. The other great thing about the Crown business, not only is it not capital-intensive, because I said the total net asset base is around $200 million for businesses you said that has, like, $2.5 billion of sales and $450 million of EBIT, thereabouts. It's not very people-intensive. They don't have a lot of -- I think the total headcount in Crown is like 300 people.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And just one last one, if I could ask just about the wine market. We've begun to see -- you can see it in the scanner data. You could see it in some of the other third-party sources that you're beginning to see some general price increases in the industry. And so I guess just so far from your perspective, how -- has that surprised you? Is the way that the market's reacting to the supply shortages and the higher costs for both bulk wine and grapes, has the industry responded in a way that you would have expected? Just sort of your outlook on how that's evolved -- your perspective on how it's evolving now and what you think may be happening as we go through the balance of the year will be helpful.", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes. I mean, I think that the industry is reacting in a fairly rational manner. As you said, grape supplies are a little tight. It's probably been exaggerated to some degree, but they're a bit tight and grape prices are up. And therefore, with raw material costs being up as well as supply being somewhat limited, in certain categories, price categories, you are seeing some pricing. So now where have we seen that? We've seen a little bit of it in the value segment, or the everyday segment below $5, which is relatively irrelevant to us. And we're also seeing in the top end, call it sort of above $20, which is also from a business perspective not particularly relevant because it represents less than 3% of the total industry. So you're seeing a little bit of it here and there and you are seeing, as what I said, some rational behavior in the marketplace. And I would expect to continue to see that as the harvest comes in and throughout the year. We're not expecting to see any, like, major changes in those trends.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Citi.", "Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "My first question is a follow-up to Judy's, when you guys talked about the opportunity to improve the EBIT growth. Is there an opportunity to expand margins or is it just a matter of kind of closing the gap between the top line and the EBIT from a gross perspective?", "Robert S. Sands", "You're talking about the beer business?", "Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Yes, I'm sorry. Excuse me, yes, for Crown.", "Robert S. Sands", "Just like all of our businesses in terms of driving EBIT growth, margin expansion is certainly one of those levers and margin expansion can occur in a variety of ways. But driving the mix of the products is certainly one of those levers. But we'll be wanting to, just like any other part of the business, continue to focus on growing that business from a top line and bottom line perspective.", "Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Fair enough. And my second question also has to do with Crown. I'm curious if you could offer a little more detail on how innovation is going to work, given that ABI is going to be your greatest competitor in the U.S. and now they're going to be in charge of producing your products, but also handling the innovation.", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes, well, they're very interested and have provided for innovation because this is an important part of the business for them. So in our agreements, so to speak, we've provided for a strong innovation pipeline as it relates to new products and new packages from Mexico, and therefore, from Modelo. And then, as I stated previously, there isn't any prohibition on our part from introducing new products that are not Mexican in origin in essence. So we're also not limited there and can look at domestic and imports from other countries, as well, with respect to our innovation plans. So basically, we will run this business like any other business. We have, fundamentally, no limitations on what we can do.", "Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "So in terms of driving the innovation, and presumably it's coming from you guys and you're asking ABI, Hey, I want either this new package or this new kind of formulation, is that right? Or they can...", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes. New packages, new products or formulations, right.", "Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then lastly, is there something in the contract that then precludes ABI from then replicating whatever clever idea you have that you're going to execute with Corona from taking that and applying it to Stella or something like that?", "Robert S. Sands", "Well, I think the -- I guess the basic answer to your question is, yes. Okay. We are the exclusive importer in the United States of their Mexican products. Okay? And basically, they can't do knockoffs and we can't do knockoffs. So the answer to your question is, fundamentally, yes. There are provisions that actually protect both parties from that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "On Crown -- it seems to be a popular topic -- a couple questions. Firstly, the -- I didn't catch it, but did you say Crown will continue to operate even though it's going to be consolidated as a separate entity?", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes. So Crown will operate as the beer division of Constellation, and will continue to operate pretty much the same as it operates right now, with very little difference. Same management team, same distribution network, same sales force. So yes, separate division.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Got it. Great. And then the incentive structure there at Crown, any intent -- I assume it's a different incentive structure than that for the presently wholly-owned businesses. Is any intent to have it be aligned with the incentive structure for the wine and spirits business or leave it as is?", "Robert S. Sands", "Well, right now Crown is a private company, right? So they don't have some of the benefits of being a wholly-owned subsidiary of a public company. So we'll be looking at ways to enhance the incentives that the Crown employees have. And I think that, clearly, that will involve looking at sort of the incentives on both sides and making sure that -- meaning wine and spirits and beer, and making sure that they're equivalent as well as consistent with the goals that we've set for the Crown business. I mean, that's what incentives are all about, is making sure that the incentives are aligned with the goals that you're trying to drive. So that was a long answer, a long way of saying, sort of, yes.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And that -- and is it -- can you just speak to generally how they are incentivized? It seems like it's more of a volume-based incentive structure than a profit weighting in the equation. Can you just speak generally to that?", "Robert S. Sands", "No. It's a pretty balanced system that relates to volume, profit and market share. That's how they're currently incentivized and they will be incentivized in the future in that regard. And then there's the typical sort of split between short-term incentives and long-term incentives. But both of those are based on pretty much the 3 things that I just talked about: market share, profit and volume depletions.", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, Mark, it's a lot like the wine business. We basically set an annual plan and those 3 components get rolled up. And if they beat those numbers in the plan, they get better than a 100% bonus. And if they don't hit market share depletions and EBIT, they get less than 100% target bonus.", "Robert S. Sands", "So very balanced in that regard. And it always is.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Got it. That's great. And then finally, on Crown, and I'll get back in the queue with a couple of wine questions. But finally, on Crown, it sounds like if you were to come up with the $1.85 billion today, it would be roughly in the neighborhood of 4.5%, 5% borrowing costs. Is that a fair sense of what the market for this transaction is?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, that's what we said earlier. We said 4% to 4.5%.", "Robert S. Sands", "Incremental on the...", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. I thought it was on the...", "Robert P. Ryder", "That was just on the $1.8 billion.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Oh, okay, I thought that was financing relating to just refinancing your existing borrowings, but okay. Fair enough.", "Robert P. Ryder", "No.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.", "Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I just want to get some more clarity on the long-term pricing algorithm you'd expect with the Crown business. There hasn't been much pricing over the last few years here despite some aggressive increases from the domestic brew brands. So given the pricing gap on Corona has closed significantly, I'm just wondering if it's reasonable to assume that perhaps you'd take more robust pricing going forward now that you've taken full control of the business in the context of improved volume trends also in general for the brand.", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes, Dara. We're generally not going to comment on pricing. Suffice it to say that the Crown management team is going to do what makes commercial sense for the business. That's pretty much as much as we can say, or are going to say at this point in time.", "Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then on the on-premise side, the rebound we've seen recently in the alcohol industry in general over the last few months here. I was just looking for more clarity on what you're seeing post the quarter here. Do you think that rebound is sustainable, or was it more transient and related to some of the favorable weather we saw earlier this year?", "Robert S. Sands", "No, we think that the rebound in on-premise is sustainable. I think that we're seeing the on-premise return to growth, and probably it's just about getting back to the pre-recession levels after taking a pretty good hit. So it's still, I would say -- no one knows for sure, but in terms of the on-premise in general for beverage alcohol, I would say that we're probably now looking at low, very low single-digit growth on the on-premise. But that's a positive development from probably flat, looking 6, 12 months ago, to significantly down immediately postrecession 2008. So we're optimistic on that [indiscernible] and Crown's business is doing very well on the on-premise, so we're happy.", "Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And on the Mark West acquisition, obviously a high-growth brand. I'm wondering if you can give us a bit more detail on what attracted you to the brand strategically? And also just implications going forward in terms of maybe consummating additional acquisitions in the same type of vain.", "Robert S. Sands", "Sure. Well, first of all, pinot noir is one of the hottest major categories/varietals in wine, and has been for some time. And secondly, Mark West is the -- is now the #1 brand in the pinot noir category. So that makes it a extremely dynamic brand to be in a major, hot varietal category and to be the #1 player, growing in IRI for the last 12 weeks at 35%. So a lot of momentum behind the brand. We think that it's got tremendous opportunity for the future. And I think in terms of why it makes a very attractive -- makes itself a very attractive acquisition candidate when you think about the fact that it doesn't come with many physical assets, obviously there's a lot of synergy there in putting the brand into our production infrastructure. Furthermore, it comes with a very good supply of grapes to ensure that we maintain the supply and quality of the product in, again, a varietal category where supplies are tight. So we've got assured supply. We've got assured quality. We don't have the physical assets. We can pop it in to our production infrastructure. There's a lot of synergies there. It's the #1 brand in pinot noir, so it's a very logical fit for us. Also just in terms of its price positioning, it still is a nice little niche for us in that it sort of fits right between 2 of our major brands, which are Robert Mondavi Private Selection and Estancia. So it's a good fit in terms of laddering from a price perspective as well. So it's kind of a perfect tuck-in, as we said.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Reza Vahabzadeh with Barclays.", "Jamie Robins", "This is actually Jamie Robins on for Reza. Can I ask you guys, can you bring us up to date us on your outlook for grape costs in fiscal 2013 for the business?", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes. We're looking for sort of normal inflationary increases in grape costs for -- did you say 2014 or 20- -- what did you said?", "Jamie Robins", "2013, sorry, coming year.", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes, I think we've talked about sort of mid-single-digit increases in just that component. But in terms of how that affects our overall cost of goods sold, it's only -- it's less than a -- it's only a relatively small percentage of our total cost of goods sold grapes, per se. And therefore, again, we're looking sort of mid-single-digit increases there. But on overall COGS, it's just sort of normal inflationary increases.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Dreyer with Gabelli Asset Management.", "Kevin V. Dreyer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Just curious, again, a couple questions around taxes and the tax basis. So will that be stepped up as well, for the tax basis of the joint venture?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, I mean the tax basis of the joint venture will be stepped up by our purchase price, by the $1.8 billion.", "Kevin V. Dreyer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Okay. Okay. And then -- and it sounds like partially -- and then is that affected by the partial amortization of those intangibles, or it'll just stay there?", "Robert P. Ryder", "No, so the way it will work, we pay the $1.8 billion, that will be tax-deductible over, say, 15 to 20 years. So we'll get a tax deduction on that. You won't see the amortization on the GAAP income statements. You'll just see that, that's going to sit in goodwill, which doesn't -- most of it, which doesn't get amortized. So but the effective tax rate for the beer business will be helped by the tax deductibility of our $1.8 billion purchase price.", "Kevin V. Dreyer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Right. Okay. So the tax basis would basically be, roughly speaking, $3.7 billion then?", "Robert P. Ryder", "No. Tax basis will be about $1.8 billion.", "Kevin V. Dreyer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Oh, the $1.8 billion, okay. Okay. Just by the -- so it's not...", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, it's pretty confusing. What I said earlier was, we're going to have to mark-to-market the 50% interest that we currently have. That does not impact the tax basis because there's no cash associated with that. It's kind of just like a book entry. So the thing that impacts the tax basis is the check we cut for the $1.8 billion.", "Kevin V. Dreyer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Got it. Got it. And then just in terms of -- with all the buyback and whatnot, what are the current shares outstanding?", "Robert S. Sands", "The current shares outstanding?", "Kevin V. Dreyer - GAMCO Investors, Inc.", "Yes.", "Robert S. Sands", "About 190 -- 190 million.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Carla Casella with JPMorgan.", "Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I had a couple questions. One is when you look at the Crown EBITDA margins -- or EBIT margins, they're coming down a little bit. Is that all of a result of the step-up in your purchasing terms from Modelo that's built into the contract?", "Robert P. Ryder", "I'm sorry. The question was about the Crown EBIT margins?", "Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Yes, the margins that you've been reporting on Crown. It's been coming down slightly every year. And I'm wondering if it's purchasing...", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, that's the relation -- the big drivers there are -- is cost of goods going up, advertising costs going up, and not offsetting that with price increases. That's the big reason why margins have come down.", "Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. When is the next step-up in the purchasing costs? Or is it something where it's tied to their production costs, or is it tied to some kind of index?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes. The way -- the purchasing costs will be reassessed every year as we enter our fiscal year. So they get reset based on inflationary trends each year.", "Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And did you give the depreciation for Crown, so I could figure out an EBITDA?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Why don't you call maybe IR on that one.", "Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then one debt question. I show -- it looks to me like you can add about $750 million of additional in term loans. Am I reading that right, or do you think you have additional availability?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Well, we have availability under the revolver of almost $800 million. Term loans, you have to go out -- we have an accordion feature, right? So we can issue more term loans, but it's not really like a revolver where it's like that available, you can get it on a daily basis. But when we go to finance the Crown acquisition, we do plan to use our revolver, which we think is on good terms, to utilize the accordion feature that we put in to our recent May refinancing, and to access the senior note markets, which, as we said earlier, our credit worthiness has gotten a little better, so the rates on our senior notes have come down since issuance almost 100 basis points.", "Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Right. Okay. Great. And one I forgot to follow up on the -- on the purchasing of products from Modelo. Is there some type of a stipulation in the contract if there's -- if Modelo fails to deliver quantity or quality of beer?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, I mean it's a normal commercial contract where we order and they have to deliver to us within x number of days. And they have to deliver the SKUs we ordered, and the product quality has to be what we expect. So kind of normal commercial terms that you would expect, that also existed under the joint venture agreement.", "Operator", "Thank you. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Sands for any closing remarks.", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining our call today. We're extremely pleased about the prospect of owning 100% of Crown Imports, the #1 beer importer in the United States. And I'm also very excited that we will be adding the Mark West brand, the top-selling pinot noir brand in the U.S., to our award-winning portfolio of wines.", "From an operational perspective, we're off to a good start for the year with strong marketplace momentum for our Crown beer business as well as our U.S. wine and spirits business, which positions us well for fiscal 2013. Our new products are being very well received in the marketplace and we are planning several new initiatives in this area throughout the coming year.", "And of course, I hope you all have the opportunity to enjoy some of these fine products during the upcoming 4th of July holiday.", "So thanks, again, for your participation, everybody.", "Operator", "Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Patty Yahn-UrlaubThank you, operator. Good morning everyone, and welcome to Constellation's Third Quarter Fiscal 2013 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer.This call complements our news release, which has also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP, comparable, organic, and constant-currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com.Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may affect the company's estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings.And now I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.Robert S. SandsThank you, Patty. Good morning and happy New Year. I hope you had a great holiday, and the opportunity to enjoy some of our fine beverages throughout the season.Before we get started, I would like to note that we are particularly proud of the fact that Constellation stock ended the calendar year on a high note as the best-performing S&P 500 consumer staple stock of 2012, increasing more than 70% for the year.We believe that much of this stock price performance has been driven by the exciting opportunity we have to obtain 100% ownership of Crown Imports. The completion of this transaction will represent the next significant milestone in our company\u2019s history, and will solidify Constellation\u2019s position as the largest volume-based U.S. multicategory supplier across the beverage alcohol segment.The deal is progressing as planned, and we continue to expect closure during the first quarter of calendar 2013.  I have nothing further to add at this point, including speculation or comments relating to transaction scenarios that are different from what we have already communicated.", "And now I would like to focus our discussion on Constellation's third quarter fiscal 2013 sales and earnings results.  This year is unfolding as expected.  As we continue to execute in achieving our overall strategic and financial goals across our beer line and spirits businesses.", "On a year-to-date basis through the third quarter, we gained market share for our Canadian wine business as well as our US wine and spirits businesses collectively cross all channels, posting solid depletion trends while maintaining excellent marketplace momentum, particularly for our collection of focus brands.", "Our focused efforts in the area of brand building, innovation and new product development are also paying off as we are benefitting from positive mix trends and distribution gains at retail as well as receiving great consumer response to our new product introductions in the marketplace.", "As you know, these initiatives represent primary growth drivers for us going forward as they are also key contributors to overall US market growth, some of our strong marketplace momentum through calendar year and has been driven by this year's incremental investments in promotion and marketing, a portion of which is in connection with the launch of more than 50 new products this year.", "And I would like to remind everybody that as we headed into this year's fiscal fourth quarter, we began to overlap last year's increase in promotional activity.", "One of the things of which I am particularly proud is the ongoing strain of awards and accolades that we continue to receive from several prominent wine industries and publications for many of our new products and our focus brands.", "They include the following: the 2009 Robert Mondavi Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve was recently awarded a 94 point score from Robert Parkers, the line advocate; wine.com, the nation's number one online wine retailer recently released its top 100 list based entirely on consumer preferences.", "Some of the excellent Constellation brands that made the list include Robert Mondavi, Ruffino, Mt. Veeder and Kim Crawford.  Impact presented blue chip awards to Estancia and Robert Mondavi Private Selection (inaudible) while hot brand awards were given to Black Box, Franciscan, Kim Crawford and Rex Goliath.", "In recent issues of Wine Enthusiast, several of our well recognized brands were awarded 90 plus point scores, including Robert Mondavi, Hogue, Ruffino, Wild Horse, Raven's Wood and (inaudible).", "From a new product perspective, beverage information grouped 2012 growth brand awards included the Dreaming Tree, Primal Roots, (Brio Halbega) and Simply Naked, while we also received impact hot prospect awards for Primal Roots, the Dreaming Tree, Simply Naked and (Escenia).", "The Rex Goliath free range red won 2012 best red wine under $8 from the World Value Wine Challenge competition.  Additionally, I would like to highlight the fact that our Mark West brand, which has been an exciting addition to our portfolio, posted third quarter marketplace volume growth of almost 30% while gaining share of the ultra premium price category in the symphony IRI channels.", "From a spirits perspective, in an effort to enhance (spective)'s flavor lineup, we will soon be introducing two new unique flavors, strawberry colada and orange cream pop.  For the third quarter, (Spectra) posted Symphony IRI growth of more than 20% in addition to gaining volume share of the boxed category.", "Black Velvet Reserve whiskey recently earned a rating of 91 points and took best in class for Canadian whiskey at the Los Angeles 2012 International Wine and Spirits competition.", "In addition, the new Black Velvet Toasted Caramel has capitalized on the hot trend of flavored whiskeys, driving overall growth of the Black Velvet brand and Symphony IRI channels to more than 20% during the third quarter.", "Before we move on to a discussion of the beer business, I would like to mention that one of the most frequently asked question I receive relates to the current pricing environment within the US wine industry.", "As I mentioned last quarter, we are currently seeing some moderate price increases in the US wine space, particularly at the less than $5 retail price point. However, there is minimal price movement within the $5-15 price range, which represents the majority of our market participation.Now, moving to the Crown Imports joint venture, Crown\u2019s third quarter results were in line with our expectation, but impacted by a few anomalies that we previously anticipated. Bob will discuss these in further detail in a few moments.Overall, the underlying Crown business remains healthy, with depletions from Modelo products growing in the 3% to 4% range during the third quarter, driven primarily by Modelo Especial. This depletion trend excludes the negative impact from the loss of the St. Pauli Girl brand. \u00a0According to retail data coinciding with the end of our third quarter, Crown continues to outperform the total U.S. beer industry, the import category, and the other three major beer suppliers in both case and dollar sales trends in the SymphonyIRI channels. Crown is also gaining share from a depletion perspective in the on-premise channel.This strong consumer demand is benefitting from the combined success of a number of promotional and marketing initiatives including Corona Extra\u2019s \u201cFind Your Beach for the Game\u201d promotion and Corona Light\u2019s \u201cRefreshing Change of Beer\u201d advertising campaign.Pacifico recently rolled out its new \u201cState of Pacifico\u201d national marketing campaign honoring the brand\u2019s free spirit lifestyle. This campaign will help drive Pacifico\u2019s rapid growth, which is being fueled by the expansion of Pacifico on draft, which is already available in 37 states.And, the Modelo Especial first-ever English language TV campaign continued this fall, highlighting the quality of the brand and engaging the social seeker consumer within the general market. Modelo Especial recently achieved a new milestone surpassing 40 million cases in depletions in calendar 2012. This represents another major achievement in its impressive history.Modelo Especial was also recently awarded the Leader\u2019s Choice \u201cBeer Brand of the Year\u201d by Market Watch magazine, and was also identified as an Impact Hot Brand Award winner for the 18th consecutive year.And last but not least, based on the success to date of Somersby Cider in current test markets, Crown will be leveraging the growing popularity of the cider business by jumping into new territory and expanding the launch to additional cities during the first quarter. Somersby is a leading global hard cider within the Carslberg portfolio that will be exclusively imported into the United States market via Crown Imports.In closing, I would like to reiterate that our team is executing. As our brand-building efforts are yielding results, we are gaining market share and we have strong marketplace momentum for our products and we are well on our way to meeting our financial goals for the year.I am very excited about the Crown deal, and I hope to have the opportunity to discuss the future strategy for our new business with you at some point after the transaction closes when we plan to host a New York City investors meeting.I would now like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our third quarter business results.Bob RyderThanks, Rob. Good morning everyone. Our comparable basis diluted EPS for Q3 came in at $0.63. This result reflects a lower-than-expected tax rate due to some favorable tax benefits. Given these and other anticipated tax benefits, we now expect our full year effective tax rate to approximate 27% versus our previous 30% estimate.Consolidated EBIT continues to track in line with our expectations. Solely due to the anticipated tax rate favorability, we are increasing our fiscal \u201913 comparable basis diluted EPS expectation to a range of $2.10 to $2.20 a share from our previous $2.00 to $2.10 range.Given those brief highlights, let\u2019s look at our third quarter 2013 P&L performance in more detail, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our news release, Q3 wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 6% as higher volumes and favorable mix were partially offset by higher promotional costs. This is consistent with our previous discussions around improved top and bottom line performance for the wine business in the back half of the year as our commercial product initiatives take hold and as we begin to overlap the prior year's promotional spending initiatives.", "For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 41% versus 40.5% for the prior year.  This reflects the benefits from favorable mix and the consolidation of the higher margin Ruffino and Mark West brands partially offset by the increase in promotional spending.", "Wine and spirits segment operating income increased $24 million to $197 million primarily due to the positive sales and gross margin results I just outlined partially offset by an increase in SG&A expense which was primarily related to an overlap of a favorable trade mark related legal settlement in Q3 of last year.", "Corporate costs increased $4 million primarily due to the overlap of a benefit recognized in Q3 of last year from the early redemption of notes receivable from Accolade, our former Australian and UK business.", "Consolidated equity earnings totaled $53 million and were level with the prior year quarter.  Equity earnings for Crown totaled $39 million versus $43 million last year.  The remainder of the equity earnings in Q3 of both fiscal '13 and fiscal '12 are primarily generated by our Open Swan joint venture.", "For the quarter, Crown generated net sales of $547 million, an increase of 1% and operating income of $79 million, a decrease of 9%.", "Third quarter net sales for Crown were tempered by the Q2 wholesaler buy-in of beer in advance of the planned price increases and the loss of St. Pauli Girl brand volume.  Crown's operating income was impacted by the volume shift and timing of marketing spend.", "Interest expense for the quarter was $61 million, up 33% versus last year.  The increase was primarily due to the higher average debt balances.  To better help frame in the drivers of the interest increase, let me discuss our debt position.", "At the end of November, our total debt was just under $4 billion.  This represents an $866 million increase from our debt level at the end of fiscal '12.  We also finished November with $201 million of available cash on our balance sheet.", "The higher than normal cash balance primarily relates to the funding of the pending Crown acquisition.", "As a reminder, in Q2, as part of securing the permanent financing for the $1.85 billion Crown transaction, we issued $650 million of 4.625% senior notes due in 2023.  The cash proceeds from the notes issuance were placed in escrow and will be released when the Crown transaction closes.  As a result, this cash has been recorded as restricted cash on our balance sheet.", "After factoring in the cash and restricted cash, our net debt at the end of November was $3.1 billion and our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio came in at 3.5 times.", "Also, as an additional reminder, during the first quarter, we refinanced our senior credit facility and issued $600 million of 6% 10-year senior notes.  Proceeds from this note issuance, along with our free cash flow generation and proceeds from stock option exercises have been effectively used to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit facility and to fund the Q1 share repurchases and the Mark West acquisition.", "In December, we entered into an accounts receivable securitization facility, which can provide up to $250 million in liquidity at and interest rate that is generally expected to be about 75 basis points lower than our revolving credit facility.", "This new facility further enhances our financial flexibility as our $850 million revolving credit facility continues to remain in place.  We will reassess our revolving credit facility after the Crown acquisition closes.", "We continue to expect interest expense for fiscal 2013 to be in the range of $225 million to $235 million.  Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 28% compared to 37% for Q3 last year.", "The favorable rate in the quarter was driven by higher foreign tax credits.  As mentioned earlier, we now anticipate the full year fiscal '13 effective tax rate to approximately 27% as a result of the foreign tax credits and some anticipated state tax benefits.", "Now let\u2019s discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capex. For the first nine months of fiscal \u201913, we generated free cash flow of $337 million, versus $587 for the same period last year. The decrease reflects the receipt of tax refunds in the prior year that were driven by the sale of our U.K. business and from higher U.S. grape and bulk wine purchases in fiscal \u201913 following the lighter grape harvest in fiscal \u201912. In addition, we are seeing higher interest costs from the senior notes issuances I just highlighted.For fiscal \u201913, we continue to expect to generate free cash flow in the range of $450 million to $500 million. As discussed earlier, we now expect fiscal \u201913 comparable basis diluted EPS guidance to be in the range of of $2.10 to $2.20 per share. For this range, we continue to assume that weighted average shares will approximate 190 million.Our comparable basis guidance excluded restructuring charges and unusual items, which are detailed on the last page of the release. It also excludes any impact from the closing of the purchase of the remaining 50% interest in Crown.As we approach the end of fiscal \u201913, we believe we are well on our way to achieving our financial goals for the year. We are seeing solid consumer takeaway and depletion trends for our U.S. wine and spirits business, with good results around our innovation efforts and initiatives supporting our focus brands.In Q4, we should continue to see volume, sales, and earnings grow nicely for wine and spirits as we overlap last year\u2019s promotional investments, and we continue to see products mix improvement driven by new products and our focus brands.The beer business continues to outperform both the total beer industry and the import category, and is on track to deliver solid performance for the year. For Q4, Crown\u2019s results are expected to be tempered by some unfavorable sales calendarization and the St. Pauli Girl transition.During the first three quarters of the year, we have seen a reasonable amount of year over year variability in all business segment results. This will continue in Q4. To get the best gauge of performance for fiscal 2013, you should focus on year to date and full year results.I would also like to note that we continue to look forward to completing the Crown transaction as the full incorporation of Crown\u2019s strong business and financial model will further enhance our overall financial profile. With that, let\u2019s open up the line for questions.Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator[Operator instructions.] Your first question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala of UBS. Please go ahead.Kaumil Gajrawala - UBSFirst question on wine. What we\u2019ve seen in the past is the first guys to move on price are the below five, but then as some time passes, you start to see more pricing move further up the scale. Is that something we should expect to happen this cycle as well?Robert S. SandsYou know, it\u2019s hard to judge, but that is what we are currently seeing, that most of the pricing that has been taken is in the below five dollar area. That segment of the market is a lot more concentrated than the above five, really being dominated by just a couple of brands and a couple of companies. Whether we\u2019ll see pricing above the five dollar mark really remains to be seen, but we certainly think that it\u2019s possible.Kaumil Gajrawala - UBSThen also as it relates to pricing, you\u2019ve taken pricing in a variety of markets at Crown. Can you talk about the price elasticity you\u2019re seeing in those markets?Robert S. SandsWe really haven\u2019t seen very much impact of the pricing that we\u2019ve taken. In other words, we haven\u2019t really seen any slowdown in our depletion trends. They continue to remain pretty robust, so we really haven\u2019t seen any impact. We would expect to see some, because whenever you take pricing there\u2019s some degree of elasticity, but we\u2019re really not seeing anything at all right now. And I would just point out that the pricing that we took was sort of significantly below just the general level of pricing that\u2019s been taken in the beer industry. So our pricing was below 2% overall, whereas the industry as a general proposition has taken more pricing than that.", "So that could be the reason why we're really not seeing any slow down or impact of our pricing thus far because it was a pretty modest increase.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "So first on the wine business, so it sounds like you're pretty pleased with the turnaround that you're seeing on that business with stepped up innovation, increased investments this year.", "Do you think that you're at a point where we could potentially see some profit improvement or do you think that you should continue to see investments perhaps exceeding sales and that compromises margin because you want to sustain the volume momentum on the wine business?", "Bob Ryder", "Yes, where we are now, Judy, we're sticking with our guidance for the year, so we are going to see a profit improvement in the wine and spirits segment, albeit not as high as the sales improvement.", "But as we said at the beginning of the year, that was our conscious effort to keep the top line moving along, to maintain or grow share and continue our momentum and to see the results of all the new products we're introducing and some additional execution focus.", "So I think we continue to stick with that and that's why we're staying with the guidance for this year.  Of course, we haven't given guidance for next year either but that -- we'll be assessing that.", "We actually haven't had our internal annual plan meetings yet, so we'll be providing guidance for fiscal '14 in around the April timeframe.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "And then just in terms of the Crown side of the business, so I know there's a lot of innovation and growth that's coming from the price segment that's premium (inaudible) that's going pretty strongly but Black Crown is coming into the market.", "Do you think that that changes the competitive landscape and whether you see risk to import pricing if you do have that price points really gaining momentum?", "Robert Sands", "We don\u2019t' see that impacting the import segment.  The import segment remains very strong.  It's driven by completely different market dynamics.  Our business' demographic is significantly different than those of some of the brands that you mentioned.", "So I don't see it being any issue whatsoever.  If anything, it's -- rising tide will float all boats.  So I don't think it's an issue for us.  If anything it portends a stronger beer business in general.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Then my last question just if you can just give some commentary around the macro, some consumer behavior, particularly as you got into more December time period.  If you look at some of the measured channel data, the beverage category seemed to have slowed a big in December, so just curious whether you're seeing a similar softening across both wine and beer, anything in terms of the channel dynamic on time versus off time.  Any color there would be great.", "Bob Ryder", "Yes, so I think we've seen all three categories -- wine, beer and spirits -- slow down as we have moved into the fourth quarter this year and we have seen the on premise slow down as well.  The on premise was probably in positive territory at the beginning of the year and as we've moved into fourth quarter we're estimating that the on premise is probably down for beverage alcohol about 3%.  So we've seen a slow down there.", "The whys and wherefores of the slow down are hard to know for sure.  We pretty much think that it's probably related to all of this fiscal cliff business, which impacted retail in general across all consumer goods but that's about the only thing that we can really say with respect to that.", "That said, the beverage alcohol category still fundamentally remains pretty strong. If we look at wine, there\u2019s very, very strong trading up going on in wine. Just for example in the quarter, the wine industry was up about 2% in volume and 6% in dollars, with the premium plus and super premium plus categories growing double digits.So things are fundamentally good, although there has been a bit of a slowdown. And if you look at our business, getting more granular here, I would say that our business performed pretty much on expectations for the holiday season. So we\u2019re not seeing any issue with respect to the full year in that regard.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Lauren Torres of HSBC. Please go ahead.Lauren Torres - HSBCMy question is on the beer business. You gave us the reasons why we saw the weakness on the profit line. I guess I\u2019m just looking for greater clarity, Bob. You mentioned some issues in the fourth quarter, so I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of timing, of marketing spend, investment spend. What\u2019s really affecting it here? I understand the inventory issue, but if that\u2019s behind us, what other pressures are we looking at?Robert S. SandsAs I tried to say in my script, this year we\u2019ve had a lot of quarter volatility, but on the last quarter call, I did say for beer the front half is going to be much stronger than the back half. That has come to fruition, and it\u2019s a number of things. As you said, Lauren, it was moving the cases into Q2 from Q3, because of the normal buy-in ahead of a price increase. There has been a change in how our marketing expense hits by quarter. So that has impacted it. And there\u2019s also been some timing impacts on SG&A as far as when you take bonus accruals versus the prior year.So that\u2019s why I said, you know, we should probably look at year to date and full year. And we haven\u2019t changed our full year guidance for wine or for beer. And for wine, what we said is net sales growth will be mid single digits, EBIT growth will be low single digits, because of that promotional investment. And in beer, we\u2019ve said net sales growth will be mid single digits and profit growth will be right around mid-single digits as well. So we\u2019re sticking to that, it\u2019s just a bit difficult for you guys to get at because of all the quarter year over year overlaps. \u00a0Lauren Torres - HSBCAnd if I could just also ask broadly, maybe Rob, as we think about you having full ownership of the Crown business, generally speaking once again can you talk about your level of comfort, marketing spend behind the brands, ability to take more pricing? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of having full control of the business where you see the opportunities to be going forward.Robert S. SandsWell, I think that first of all in terms of our marketing plans, I would say really we anticipate no change in how we\u2019ve been marketing the brands, or really the levels of investment behind our marketing. So we will continue to market the brands as aggressively as we have in the past. Now, as to pricing, our philosophy hasn\u2019t changed either. Crown monitors the markets carefully. We look at things on a market by market basis, and they will continue to address pricing on a very strategic level as they have in the past. So really no change on either front.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead.Bryan Spillane - Bank of AmericaJust a couple of questions. First, just on the tax rate, I know it\u2019s going to be lower this year, but should we do anything as we\u2019re modeling the tax rate going forward, and let\u2019s think about it maybe just excluding Crown, is there any other permanent long term reduction to your tax rate? Or are we still just kind of cleaning up past open tax issues?Bob RyderTwo pieces to that, Bryan. The reduced tax rate guidance this year is due to what you said. It\u2019s due to some tax planning around our international business historically, which is kind of coming to fruition. In the grand scheme of things, because we\u2019ve become much more of a North American business, we should expect our tax rate to go up. Now, where the government\u2019s going to go with corporate tax rates, we don\u2019t know. So that\u2019s just business as usual. We would expect our tax rates to be going up going into the future.Bryan Spillane - Bank of AmericaAnd then I guess as you acquire more inventory, you\u2019ve got inventory, based on the larger harvest - we\u2019re talking about wine here - can you talk at all about how you think you\u2019re positioned on how you -- the cost of wine maybe relative to your competitors or relative to what you think the market is?  I'm just trying to get a sense of how well you think you've bought inventory and where your costs are on wine going into -- really going into the balance of calendar '13.", "Robert Sands", "Yes, we've discussed this before.  It was a good harvest this year, both quantity and I spent a lot of time out in California with the wine makers and I've never seen them happier about the quality of the products.", "We're going to have some just fantastic wines when these come out to the consumer.  But, look, it's a competitive marketplace.  The price per ton for the grapes did go up for everybody and we were just as impacted as everybody else.", "Now, we're a little bit more broad, so it depends what geography you're buying the wine from.  But we're buying a lot from all the regions because we have wines that hit all the different price points.", "But our cost per ton of wine in our tanks as we sit now is -- will be higher year-over-year when that wine comes out and hits cost of sales.", "Bryan Spillane - Bank of America", "One last one just in terms of the mix dynamic in wine.  Your mix was pretty good this quarter in terms of price mix even in context of having some promotion.  Can you talk a little bit about, A, just some of the drivers of mix within your wine and spirit segment first?", "And then second, are you seeing any evidence in the market at this point that as you're seeing prices rise at the value segment are consumers trading the next price tier at all?", "Bob Ryder", "Yes, if you look at IRI, you can see pricing in the below $5 a bottle and volumes aren't all that great in that price scheme but they really haven't been recently.  When you play in that price segment you have a pretty thin margin, so if your cost of goods go up, you've got to pretty much price it on to stay profitable.", "But I think in the wine categories, Rob said earlier, wine above $5 a bottle continues to grow much faster than wine below $5 a bottle and we are benefitting from that industry trend.", "In addition to that, because we've added global Ruffino sales and we've added Mark West to our portfolio year-over-year, they are both higher price point wines and higher gross profit margin wines, so that's also helping us from a mix perspective.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays.", "Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays", "Yes, just on the M&A front, obviously you have a big transaction pending right now but you were able to get some smaller tuck-in transactions done earlier this year.  Are there more opportunities of that type that you are looking for, a type similar to Mark West as well as Ruffino or are you just really focused on the base business?", "Bob Ryder", "Yes, I think that if we see some strategic tuck-in opportunities manifest themselves we will consider taking advantage of them.  Ruffino's worked real well.  Mark West has worked real well.  Those are great opportunities to fill in niches in the portfolio that are very strategic and will generate a very good return for the company.  So if those type of opportunities present themselves, we will avail ourselves of it.", "Reza Vahabzadeh - Barclays", "And then as far as mix, are you seeing any sales mix or volume really moving from the $10 to $15 price range back down to the $5 to $10 range or any other volume shift within those price buckets that you operate in?", "Bob Ryder", "No, I think that mix is generally improving in the industry, favoring the higher price product, not the lower price product, so basically people are trading up period from the $5 to the above $5, from the $8 to $12 to the above $12.", "So we see very, very positive mix shift in general occurring in that whole segment, so from $0 to say $20.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of (Robert Hartenstein) - ISI.", "(Robert Hartenstein) - ISI", "Mark West, I think you said volumes were up about 35%.  Can you talk a little bit about where you are in terms of penetration of that brand and remind us on your acquisition criteria in terms of return on invested capital and how close are you to hitting your targets on Mark West and, if you aren't there yet, when do you think you will be?", "Robert Sands", "Yes, so first of all, I think we said the brand was up about 30%, which is very strong.  And in terms of penetration, Mark West has very, very good on premise distribution as well as very good off premise distribution.", "In terms of our targets, Mark West has exceeded our expectations with respect of what we thought the brand would do.  We probably anticipated some transition risk in buying the brand.", "The transition risk has not come to fruition.  The brand has continued to grow basically at the same rates that it was growing prior to the acquisition.  In terms of our acquisition criteria, we are always looking and anticipate a return significantly in excess of our weighted average cost of capital and we fully expect that to be the case with the Mark West acquisition which is running ahead of our expectations.", "Bob Ryder", "Yes, just to follow up on that, Robert, Mark West, as you recall, we didn't buy any hard assets.  So what we bought was the brand and the grape contracts, so to Rob's point, the returns can be better on that because we can plug it into an existing winery and it actually leverages existing fixed costs.", "(Robert Hartenstein) - ISI", "Can you just give us a sense of timing of when you'll hit -- when you think you'll hit your cost to capital on that or are you there already and when you may be able to exceed?  I'm just trying to get a sense of how long it takes to get there.", "Bob Ryder", "Yes, I would say on a transaction like this we would expect to hit it within a couple years.", "(Robert Hartenstein) - ISI", "And then exceed it by several hundred basis points pretty soon after?", "Bob Ryder", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Rob, two-part question on the wine business, firstly, can you speak generally about how you think about promotions?  It sounds like with the on premise trend you just cited to Judy in having this nice quality high level of inventory you have a bias for continued promotion.  Is that a fair way of thinking about it?  That's question one.", "And then question two is in the quarter, do you still think you'll have positive depletions in light of what you're saying about the on premise trade?", "Robert Sands", "Yes, so first of all, Mark, as it relates to promotions, yes, it really is vastly related to the off premise and how we sell in the off premise.  Remember the on premise is only about 15% of our wine business.", "So the promotional activity is really geared -- although there is some on the on premise -- but it's really geared around the off premise and it's all about driving merchandising of our brand, so basically ads, displays and deals for the consumer in the marketplace because that's what drives in the wine business, in particular, growth.", "It's getting the product on the floor and getting it in feature ads by the retailers.  So it's mostly an off premise activity.", "And then, no, we don't expect the slow down on the on premise to really affect the business overall because percentage wise, you're really talking about only 15% of the business and then to the extent that there is a slow down, it's a pretty small percent.  So it's a small percent of the small percent, so it's not going to have any significant impact on our results.", "Despite the fact that the on premise has slowed down, we have some pretty strong brands that continue to grow very nicely and rapidly in the on premise, Mark West being a really good example of that, Kim Crawford being a good example.", "So we expect -- and Ruffino being a good example.  Those were brands that regardless of the slowdown will continue to generate strong results in the on premise.  So we don't really expect that to have any impact on us.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "If I could follow up, it sounds like you think low-single digit depletions all channel is still a pretty good go for a rate of growth for you guys.", "Robert Sands", "Yes, more like -- yes, more like mid, low to mid.  You're talking wine, right?", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "", "Yes, yes, US wine.", "Robert Sands", "Yes, so mid and beer, too, for that matter.  But year-to-date we're at about 3.5% depletion growth, which is ahead of the market by probably 100 basis points.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "So the thing that's driving my question -- I think you've answered it -- is that in the quarter you had plus 3.5% and in the prior quarter it was plus 7%, so I'm just trying to get a sense if you feel like you reached a leveling off steady state rate of growth.  It sounds like you did.", "Robert Sands", "Well, as we've said for the full year we're anticipating mid-single digit depletion growth.", "Bob Ryder", "Yes, Mark, I would just repeat what I said in my script because there's just a lot of noise in line of beer by quarter.  So year-to-date wine depletions are up about 3.6%.  That's growing faster than the category, so the category is healthy.  We're a little bit healthier.", "If you look at the full year -- and I think our full-year guidance is around that mid-single digit.  So we're pretty happy with that level.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer - Citigroup.", "Vivien Azer - Citigroup", "My first question has to do with your new product introductions.  In wine you clearly have been very active.  I'm curious if you can comment on the contribution that new innovation -- and the contribution you've seen from new innovation to your shipment or depletion growth.", "Robert Sands", "Yes, as we define it, new products, which are products that have been introduced in the last 24 months, are contributing about 5% to 6%.  In terms of volume, a little bit more, in terms of net sales, about 7%.", "Vivien Azer - Citigroup", "And can you comment on what impact the absence of St. Pauli had on the Crown Imports business this quarter?", "Robert Sands", "It overall for the year we're looking at about 2 million cases and it's about maybe 1% with the impact.  So yes, it's not a big deal here.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Carla Casella - JPMorgan.", "Carla Casella - JPMorgan", "I'm wondering if the impact, if you'll have any impact on the industry from the fires and the drought we're seeing in Australia right now.", "Robert Sands", "Well, not for us, but I don't think so.  I don't think we're going to see too much impact.  I mean, Australia in general remains over supplied as a general proposition, so anything that impacts supply in Australia is probably good.", "Now, our participation in Australia at this stage is really largely through our 20% interest in Accolade, which were the Australian assets that we sold off a couple years ago.  So we're not impacted by it.", "Carla Casella - JPMorgan", "When you look at your total grape buy for I guess either last year or this coming year, how much of it is coming from US versus other key markets?  I guess when you talk about buying bulk wine, is that coming from US or is that coming from other markets?", "Robert Sands", "Both.  The vast majority is US but we buy lots of non-US bulk as well, especially for the Canadian market, which has particular -- which is quite different from the US market in that they have a segment of product called international -- yes, well, (inaudible) international content.  So we buy a lot of bulk wine for -- bulk imported wine for the Canadian market.", "Carla Casella - JPMorgan", "Then there's been a lot of talk about the on premise sales.  How much of the -- I'm trying to get a sense of how much is the business' on versus off premise and how much it differs for wine versus beer.", "Robert Sands", "For wine, yes, it's about 15% for us and for beer it's a little bit more, more like a quarter, 20% to 25%.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Brent Cooper - Consumer Edge Research.", "Brent Cooper - Consumer Edge Research", "I think about 1.5 years ago on your analyst -- when you guys talked about blending technique, taking costs out and I'm trying to recall what the timeframe was that we're going to see that.  So as we're going to calendar '13 and fiscal '14, can you just update us on those efforts and if we're likely to see the benefit of those.  Is that this year or is that a calendar '14, fiscal '15 benefit for you guys?", "Robert Sands", "Yes, I would say that we will start to see some of it in the fourth quarter this year.  Most of it will come next year and what's ending up happening is those savings, which we can see and they are real, are helping to offset some of the input cost inflation from a higher cost per ton grapes that we've seen in the harvest for the calendar '11 harvest and the calendar '12 harvest.", "Brent Cooper - Consumer Edge Research", "And just to be clear, when you say the fourth quarter this year, you mean fiscal '13.", "Robert Sands", "Yes.  Some in fiscal '13 but most of it will come next year, the whites this year and most of the reds and most of the whites next year.", "Operator", "This concludes the question-and-answer session for today.  I would now like to turn the call back over to Rob Sands for any closing remarks.", "Rob Sands", "Well, thank, everybody, for joining our call today.  As I mentioned, we are very excited about the Crown deal and I look forward to seeing you in New York once the deal is closed to discuss the strategy for our new business model.", "I would say I'm very confident that we will meet our financial and strategic goals as our plan is to continue sell and execution of our initiatives throughout the final quarter of the year.  So thanks, again, for your participation today.", "Operator", "Thank you.  This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Constellation Brands Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Patty Yahn-Urlaub", "Thank you, Laurie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Constellation's fourth quarter and fiscal year end 2013 conference call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release, which has also been furnished to the SEC.", "During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP, comparable, organic and constant currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com.", "Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company's estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings.", "And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.", "Robert S. Sands", "Thank you, Patty. And good morning, and welcome to our call. Before we begin our year-end review of fiscal 2013, I would like to mention that I am very excited about the fact that we have reached an agreement in principle with the U.S. Department of Justice, the finalization of which will allow Constellation to proceed with the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Crown Imports as well as the Piedras Negras brewery in Mexico and the perpetual brand rights for the Modelo portfolio in the U.S.", "Earlier this week, we received unanimous approval from the Mexican Antitrust Commission, which further paves the way to completion of the revised deal between ABI and Constellation. This transaction represents a significant milestone for Constellation, as it is the most transformational acquisition in the history of our company. It will solidify our place in the U.S. beer market for the long term as the perpetual brand owner and producer of the iconic Modelo beer portfolio, which includes Corona Extra, the best-selling imported beer; Corona Light, the leading imported light beer; and Modelo Especial, the third-largest and one of the fastest-growing major imported beer brands.", "Overall, this deal will allow us to nearly double the sales of our company, diversify our profit stream, significantly enhance our earnings and free cash flow and provide new avenues for growth. It will also reestablish Constellation's position as the largest multi-category supplier for beer, wine and spirits. We will not only be the third-largest total beverage alcohol company in the U.S. but the #3 brewer and supplier of beer for the U.S. market.", "I would like to reiterate that there are 3 key components of the new beer transaction: number one, Constellation will purchase the remaining 50% of Crown that we do not already own, giving us complete independent control of distribution, marketing, promotion and pricing as the new brand owner in the U.S.; number two, Constellation will be granted a perpetual, non-terminable license for the import and distribution of the Modelo brands that Crown currently sells in the U.S., with exclusive rights to the brands and freedom to develop brand extensions and innovations for the U.S. market; number three, Constellation will acquire one of the world's largest and most state-of-the-art brewing facilities in Piedras Negras, Mexico, as well as the full profit stream associated with all sales of the Modelo brands in the U.S.", "Now the Piedras Negras brewery is the crown jewel of production for Modelo. The brewery is self-sufficient, utilizes state-of-the-art technology and was built to be readily expanded to increase production capacity. Constellation's purchase of the Piedras Negras brewery provides independence of supply for Crown and complete control of the production of the Modelo brands for marketing and distribution in the U.S.", "Current capacity for this facility is approximately 10 million hectoliters, or about 120 million cases, with scalability to 30 million hectoliters. Our goal within the next 3 years is to expand Piedras Negras' capacity from 10 million hectoliters to 20 million hectoliters, which we project will be more than enough to supply 100% of the U.S. market into the foreseeable future.", "During this 3-year time frame, Constellation and ABI will enter into an interim supply agreement. This is intended to ensure continuity of supply and quality of products, with the expectation that Constellation will become fully self-sufficient thereafter.", "During this period, Constellation will purchase product at a fixed price per case, subject to annual adjustment based on the U.S. consumer price index. In addition, Constellation and ABI will enter into a Transition Services Agreement, primarily to provide Constellation with brewery operations and general management assistance, brewery expansion consulting and technical support and brewery procurement and logistics services.", "For nearly 2 decades, Constellation, either directly or through Crown, has imported, marketed and sold the Modelo brands in the U.S. During this time, the Crown team has successfully built the Modelo portfolio into an enviable position of leadership and growth driven by their strength in brand building and the strong relationships they have established with our distributors and retailers.", "And now, I would like to focus our discussion on Constellation's year-end fiscal 2013 sales and earnings results. I am very, very pleased with our results for fiscal 2013, and we executed against all of our key strategic goals and initiatives for the year. As you know, the fiscal 2013 -- fiscal 2013 represented a year of investment in new products and brand-building activity, particularly for our U.S. wine and spirits business. We launched approximately 50 new items, including new brands, pipeline \textensions and packaging innovations. Many of these activities represented existing brand extensions, where we leveraged the equity of our Focus Brands to capture opportunities that were designated or designed to meet changing consumer taste preferences for more fruit-forward and easier-drinking wines.", "We targeted hot categories experiencing significant growth, like Moscato, Malbec and Sweet Red blends, launching brands like Rex Goliath, Free Range Red, which won the 2012 best red wine under $8 from the World Value Wine Challenge competition.", "We also increased national advertising support for certain key brands like Kim Crawford, which launched its Undo Ordinary media print campaign centered on art and fashion lifestyles. I am proud to announce that Kim Crawford recently surpassed the 1 million case mark in global sales, which is a great new milestone for this popular brand.", "From a TV advertising perspective, we aired commercials supporting our fast-growing Black Box, Simply Naked and SVEDKA Vodka brands, as well as our largest brand, Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. We purchased Mark West, a top-selling pinot noir brand and a fabulous addition to our portfolio, which posted double-digit sales, depletion and SymphonyIRI growth trends for the year.", "Overall, throughout fiscal 2013, our U.S. wine and spirits business benefited from ongoing consumer trade-up trends, positive mix, distribution gains at retail and great consumer response to our new product introductions in the marketplace.", "Collectively, these activities helped to drive excellent marketplace momentum, including market share gains and above-market depletion trends of nearly 4% across our entire U.S. wine and spirits portfolio, while our collection of Focus Brands grew at almost double that rate for the year.", "As a result of our efforts, we are garnering more awards and recognition than ever before from prominent industry publications, particularly for our new products and our Focus Brands. They include the following: constellation had 9 brands on this year's SymphonyIRI list of Top 30 Momentum Table Wine Brands for 2012; we won 11 2012 Hot Brand Awards from Impact magazine; and several of our new brands landed on Beverage Information Group's list of 2013 Growth Brand awards.", "Our Focus Brands that received these awards included Kim Crawford, Clos du Bois, Mark West, SVEDKA, Ruffino, Rex Goliath and Woodbridge, just to name a few. And our new product offerings included on the awards list included Simply Naked, The Dreaming Tree, Primal Roots and Thorny Rose.", "From a spirits perspective, for fiscal 2013, SVEDKA posted double-digit consumer takeaway trends in SymphonyIRI channels in addition to gaining volume and dollar share of the vodka category. SVEDKA is currently the #2 imported vodka brand and a top 10 spirits brand in the United States. During the fourth quarter, we launched and added 2 new unique flavors, Strawberry Colada and Orange Cream Pop, to SVEDKA's flavor lineup.", "For the year, Black Velvet grew double digits in SymphonyIRI channels, driven by the popularity of Black Velvet Toasted Caramel, which recently received a 90-point rating from the Wine Enthusiast magazine and a gold medal from Beverage Testing Institute's International Review of Spirits award.", "Now in addition, we are on the cusp of launching the new Black Velvet Cinnamon Rush as we continue to build on the momentum of Toasted Caramel with a new flavor innovation.", "Heading into fiscal 2014, the overarching strategy for our wine and spirits business includes 3 key tenets: number one is keep our big brands healthy; and number two, continue our focus on innovation and new products; and lastly, number three, plan to drive those key Focus Brands that have the greatest growth potential, although this will require some additional marketing investment in 2014. In a few minutes, Bob will provide additional details regarding how this factors into our wine and spirits growth model for the year. Overall, our goal is to maintain our strong marketplace momentum and pursue market share gains for our wine and spirits business in fiscal 2014.", "Now moving to the Crown Imports joint venture. Crown had another exceptional year, driving record sales for Modelo Especial, Corona Light, Negra Modelo and Pacifico while posting positive depletion trends for all major Modelo brands.", "Corona Extra exceeded the 100 million case mark for the year and was the only imported brand to achieve this sales milestone. Calendar year 2012 marked the 16th consecutive year that Corona Extra remained the leader in the imported beer category.", "Corona Extra continues to blaze new trails through marketing investments with sports properties that are strategic for the brand like the National Football League, Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association and NCAA basketball.", "As for Corona Light, it continues to strengthen its own identity with its new advertising campaign that is driving consumers to trade up from domestic lights. Overall, this brand is outpacing the premium light category and is growing across all major geographies.", "One of the gems the Crown portfolio, Modelo Especial, achieved a new milestone in calendar 2012 by surpassing 40 million cases in depletions. The brand almost -- also became the #2 import beer in the U.S. convenience store channel on a volume basis. While draft represents only a small part of the Crown overall volume, depletions grew almost 60% for this format, increasing brand recognition for the Corona Light, Negra Modelo and Pacifico brands throughout fiscal 2013.", "I'm also very proud of Crown's long list of achievements for fiscal 2013, which include the following: Corona was named one of the best global brands by Interbrand and was only 1 of 3 brands to be recognized. Market Watch not only recognized Modelo Especial as a Hot Brand Award winner for the 19th consecutive year but also awarded this brand its Leaders Choice Beer Brand of the Year Award. In addition, Modelo Especial ranked as the #1 momentum beer brand in 2012 in SymphonyIRI channels. And finally, Impact magazine announced that Modelo Especial, Corona Light and Pacifico were all Blue Chip Brand Award winners in 2012.", "Collectively, the initiatives I have just outlined contributed to Crown's strong marketplace performance as the business grew depletions in the 3% to 4% range in fiscal 2013. Overall, this is the third consecutive year that Crown has outperformed the import and total U.S. beer categories, which demonstrates the strength of the Crown brand portfolio and its marketing programs and execution at retail.", "I am excited about Crown's organic growth prospects for fiscal 2014, as we are once again targeting sales and depletion trends to exceed the U.S. beer industry and import trends. Although it's premature to discuss the entirety of our plans for the upcoming year, some of the initiatives that we have underway include the following: Crown plans to launch Modelo Especial Chelada by early fall, which is expected to build on the brand strength of Modelo Especial. This product will tap into a new occasion for this brand's core Hispanic consumer. Modelo Especial also added a broadcast sponsorship of the Gold Cup, a soccer tournament of 25 matches in 13 U.S. cities, which will help to build the brand's awareness and trial.", "Crown is planning draft format market expansions for Corona Light, Negra Modelo and Pacifico. Corona Extra will debut new TV advertising under its Find Your Beach campaign while launching new ads for the Hispanic market. Crown's new advertising for Corona Light beginning this spring will be supplemented by a combined TV, digital and social media campaign. Corona Light will also sponsor Kenny Chesney's 2013 U.S. tour, leveraging Kroger as a strategic retail partner through its Rhythm & Brews program.", "Pacifico will debut its first TV ads in Southern California. The new Pacifico, Discovered in Baja, Imported by Surfers campaign includes several TV ads that tell the Pacifico story in an emotional way.", "And finally, during 2014, Chef Rick Bayless will work with Crown to promote Negra Modelo, Pacifico and Victoria, creating recipes and unique food pairing options for each brand that can be leveraged at retail.", "In closing, we had a great year, driving above-market depletion growth and market share gains across our beer, wine and spirits businesses. I am very excited about the Crown deal, as Constellation's full ownership of this great beer business provides an additional strategic lever for driving profitable, organic growth. I look forward to meeting with you in New York on June 5 to discuss the future strategy for our business.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our year-end business results and our outlook for fiscal 2014.", "Robert P. Ryder", "Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Our comparable basis diluted EPS for fiscal 2013 came in at $2.19, and free cash flow came in at $494 million. Our results reflect a slightly lower-than-expected effective tax rate. Exclusive of the tax rate, our results were generally in line with our expectations.", "Given those brief highlights, let's look at fiscal 2013 performance in more detail, where my comments will generally focus on comparable financial results.", "As you can see from our news release, wine and spirits net sales on an organic, constant currency basis increased 3% as higher volume and favorable mix were partially offset by higher promotional costs. Our brand-building investments and innovation efforts have contributed to improvement in our top line and depletion trend and have helped drive our market share gains for our wine and spirit business. The acquisition of Mark West and the remaining interest in Ruffino provided further contribution to our growth as total net sales for the year increased 5%.", "For the year, our consolidated gross margin was 39.9% versus 40.1% in the prior year. This result was generally in line with our expectations and reflects the impact of higher promotional spending and cost of goods sold, mostly offset by the benefits from the consolidation of the higher-margin Ruffino and Mark West brands and favorable organic product mix.", "Wine and spirits segment operating income increased $28 million to $650 million, primarily due to sales growth, as operating margin for this segment remained fairly consistent.", "Corporate costs increased $12 million, primarily due to higher compensation-related costs, higher costs associated with our technology investments and the overlap of a benefit recognized last year from the early redemption of notes receivable from Accolade, our former Australian and U.K. business.", "Consolidated equity earnings totaled $234 million versus $229 million in the prior year. Equity earnings for Crown totaled $221 million versus $215 million in the prior year. When we acquired the remaining interest of Ruffino in the second half of fiscal '12, reporting for this business moved out of equity earnings. The reduction in equity earnings in fiscal '13 as a result of this reporting change was offset by strong profit growth from our Opus One joint venture.", "For the year, Crown generated net sales of $2.6 billion, an increase of 5%, and operating income of $448 million, an increase of 4%. The net sales increase was largely driven by volume growth led by strong, double-digit growth of Modelo Especial, which sailed past the $40 million case mark this year. Overall portfolio growth was tempered by the loss of St. Pauli Girl brand volume at the end of Q1. The increase in operating income primarily reflects volume growth.", "Interest expense for the year was $227 million, up 25% versus the last year. The increase was primarily due to higher average debt balances. To better help frame the drivers of interest increase, let me discuss our debt position, which saw quite a bit of activity in fiscal '13 with more to come in fiscal '14.", "At the end of February, our total debt was $3.3 billion. This represents a $176 million increase from our debt level at the end of fiscal 2012. We also finished February with $332 million of cash on our balance sheet, an increase of $246 million versus the prior year end. the higher-than-normal cash balance primarily relates to the funding of the pending beer acquisition.", "After factoring in the cash, our net debt at the end of February was just under $3 billion and slightly below the net debt balance at the end of fiscal 2012. Our net debt-to-comparable basis EBITDA ratio moved down to 3.3x at the end of fiscal 2013.", "As a reminder, during the first quarter of fiscal '13, we refinanced our senior credit facility and issued $600 million of 6% 10-year senior notes. Proceeds from this note issuance, along with our free cash flow generation and proceeds from stock option exercises, were effectively used to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit facility and to fund the Mark West acquisition and the Q1 stock repurchases. These repurchases totaled 18 million shares at a cost of $383 million.", "In addition, near the end of Q2, as part of securing the permanent financing for the original $1.85 billion Crown transaction, we issued $650 million of 4.625% senior notes, due 2023. The cash proceeds from the note issuance were placed in escrow. Because of differences between the terms of the original Crown Imports acquisition agreement announced in June 2012 and the revised transaction agreement announced in February '13, the $650 million of notes were redeemed with the escrow proceeds before the end of fiscal 2013. We recognized and paid interest for the period that these notes were outstanding.", "Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 26% for fiscal 2013. This rate included the benefit of higher foreign tax credits and compares to a 17% rate for fiscal 2012, which reflected the favorable outcome of various tax items.", "Now let's briefly discuss the fourth quarter. Comparable basis diluted EPS for the quarter came in at $0.47. This compares to $0.69 for Q4 last year, which included the recognition of the significant tax rate benefits. The wine and spirits performance in the quarter was strong, with organic constant currency net sales up 8%, driven by volume growth and favorable product mix.", "Crown's results were tempered by the overlap of a strong Q4 in fiscal '12, fewer selling days in the quarter versus the prior year period and the loss of the St. Pauli Girl volume. Crown's strong retail performance in IRI channels continued in Q4.", "Now let's discuss fee cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For fiscal '13, we generated free cash flow of $494 million, which was at the high end of our guidance range and compares to $715 million in fiscal '12. The decrease primarily reflects the receipt of tax refunds in the prior year period that were driven by the sale of our U.K. business and higher U.S. grape and bulk wine purchases in fiscal 2013 following the lighter grape harvest in fiscal 2012. In addition, we saw higher interest costs from the debt activity highlighted earlier.", "Now let me highlight some financial details related to the pending acquisition activities for the beer business before discussing our fiscal 2014 guidance.", "In February, we added the acquisition of the Piedras Negras brewery and the perpetual brand rights for the Modelo brands in the U.S. to the previously agreed transaction to acquire the remaining 50% of Crown. This new transaction is expected to close around the end of the first quarter of fiscal '14 or shortly thereafter.", "The initial purchase price for the combined transaction is $4.75 billion. This includes $1.85 billion for the remaining interest in Crown, which represents an 8.5x multiple of the acquired EBIT of Crown for fiscal 2012.", "The remaining $2.9 billion for the brewery and perpetual brand rights represented a 9.3x multiple based on the initial assumed EBITDA of $310 million, which represented the estimated profit stream from Modelo's sale of beer to Crown for calendar 2012. The $2.9 billion purchase price is subject to post-closing adjustment. The purchase price adjustment will be equal to 9.3x multiple for each U.S. dollar above or below the initial assumed $310 million EBITDA amount. The adjustment payment is capped at an EBITDA level of $370 million even if the calendar 2012 EBITDA amount is determined to be higher than the $370 million. We anticipate that the post-closing payment will occur in fiscal '15.", "We further committed bridge financing in place for the acquisition activities -- sorry, we have fully committed bridge financing. Permanent financing is expected to consist of a combination of senior notes and term loans, with the remainder of the funding coming from the company's revolving credit facility, accounts receivable securitization facility and available cash.", "Now let's move to our full year fiscal '14 outlook. We're forecasting comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.85 a share and free cash flow to be in the range of $475 million to $575 million. These projections assume the beer transaction closes at the end of Q1 of fiscal 2014 and exclude any acquisition accounting impacts or any variation from the statutory effective tax rate for the beer transaction.", "For our wine and spirits business, we are targeting to grow volume at least in line with the U.S. wine and spirits category and generate favorable product mix in fiscal '14. This should put organic revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range.", "The anticipated impact of higher grape cost and the additional marketing investments highlighted by Rob are expected to result in low to mid-single-digit operating income growth for the wine and spirits business.", "For the beer business, Crown is targeting depletions and net sales growth in the low to mid-single-digit range. Operating income growth for Crown before any benefits from beer manufacturing and brand owner profit is expected to be in the mid-single-digit range.", "Although a finalized amount is not yet available, we currently estimate the EBITDA associated with the profit stream from Modelo's sale of beer to Crown Imports in calendar 2012 was approximately $370 million versus the initial assumed amount of $310 million. Depreciation and amortization associated with the 2012 brewery profit stream is estimated to be around $50 million.", "In fiscal 2014, we will see less than a full year of beer manufacturing and brand owner profit. We expect beer input cost inflation in the mid-single-digit range, and we anticipate the peso to U.S. dollar exchange rate to be less favorable versus calendar 2012. We anticipate the cost of the COGS inflation and ForEx rate change to be in the $20 million to $40 million range as compared to the calendar 2012 brewery profits.", "Our guidance also includes the following assumptions: interest expense in the range of $345 million to $355 million; tax rate approximating 37%; and weighted average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 199 million.", "The targeted increase versus last year of the shares outstanding is being driven by the significant increase in our stock price and the related impact that this stock price improvement is expected to have on stock option exercises and diluted shares outstanding.", "Our free cash flow guidance includes capital expenditures in the range of $200 million to $230 million. This includes CapEx of $80 million to $90 million, primarily related to our wine and spirits business, and $120 million to $140 million for expansion activities at the Piedras Negras brewery. The anticipated increase in wine and spirits CapEx represents investments to support the anticipated future growth of the business.", "We have recently refined our estimate of the total CapEx associated with our brewery expansion plans, and we now expect to spend between $500 million and $600 million over a 3-year period as part of our plan to increase brewery capacity from 10 million hectoliters to 20 million hectoliters. Fiscal '14 CapEx for the brewery expansion is proportionately lighter due to the timing of the transaction close.", "Our comparable basis guidance excludes restructuring charges and unusual items, which are detailed on the last page of our press release. We currently estimate the onetime items associated with the beer transaction to approximate $80 million in fiscal 2014. This includes approximately $50 million primarily related to professional services and transition costs associated with the transaction, which will negatively impact our free cash flow for the year. The remaining $30 million of onetime costs is for financing-related fees. The payment for these fees is included in the financing section of our cash flow statement. I would like to emphasize that the onetime cost and tax rate projections factored in the guidance I just highlighted are based on preliminary estimates.", "This is an exciting time at Constellation. In fiscal '13, we met or exceeded our initial guidance for the year, and we demonstrated very positive commercial success across wine, spirits and beer as we gained market share in all 3 categories. We demonstrated organic sales growth, greatly improved energy around new product introductions, and we added a fast-growing, high-margin Mark West brand to our wine portfolio. Our strong free cash flow was utilized to buy back almost 10% of shares outstanding at a price more than 50% below our current stock price. We also reduced our net debt, and we used our free cash flow to acquire Mark West in an accretive transaction.", "As we enter 2014, there's even more good news as our sales momentum continues and, once again, we expect to gain share across the growing and high-margin beverage alcohol categories. In addition, we expect to grow organic EBIT at a better rate than in fiscal '13.", "As outlined by Rob, we are moving towards completion of the beer transaction. The structure of the transaction makes us completely -- makes us a completely autonomous competitor in the healthy U.S. beer industry, exclusively at the growing high end of the market. This transaction diversifies our consumer base, essentially doubles our annual sales and operating profits and greatly enhances our operating margins.", "Over the medium and longer term, it dramatically increases free cash flow and helps smooth out cash flow receipts over our fiscal year period. We are financing the deal in a very favorable interest rate environment, with an all-in interest rate targeted in the 3% to 4% range. Although our leverage will be in the low 5x range when factoring in a full year of acquisition earnings, we expect to focus on debt pay-down and to delever at a good pace, and we expect to be below 4x in approximately 2 years. This deleverage alone should create some dramatic improvements in earnings per share and free cash flow.", "With that, we're happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of D.A. Davidson.", "Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "As we think about '14, Rob, I was intrigued by your comments that you do expect to see some margin pressure in wine. And we've kind of had this argument that we should begin to see wine pricing improving as the grape supply/demand balance improves. Can you expand a bit on that?", "Robert S. Sands", "Sure, Tim. We do have higher grape costs coming through from the calendar year 2011 and 2012 grape harvest. So that's what's primarily putting the margin pressure on the wine side. Now as it relates to pricing, we've seen pricing in the low end of the market, meaning below $5, which doesn't really impact us because we don't really have a significant portion of our portfolio in this segment. But generally, in the segments which we call Premium Plus, $5 and above, or sort of the mainstream of the commercial wine business, between $5 and $15, we've actually seen very little to no pricing when you start looking at the market on a brand-by-brand and SKU-by-SKU basis. And I say brand-by-brand and SKU-by-SKU because, if you're looking at IRI data, you have to be very careful to take into account that it appears that there's pricing, but it's really all mix-related as the higher-priced products continue to grow at a faster rate than the lower-priced products. So it's primarily higher grape cost coming through and no pricing, which is driving some margin erosion, but a relatively modest level of margin erosion. Right now, I would say our basic strategy is to continue to invest behind our Focus Brands to drive market share growth and make sure that they remain healthy so that when the opportunity does arise, we will be able to leverage the P&L to take advantage of the investments that we've made and the strength that we've achieved for our big brands and our Focus Brands.", "Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Great. And just a follow-up on the Modelo Colada launch, if I heard you correctly, by fall. Is that innovation that occurred strictly by Crown, or it was that -- is that also something that Modelo corporate is launching as well?", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes. By the way, that's Chelada.", "Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Chelada, okay, sorry.", "Robert S. Sands", "It would be a strange combination to have a beer colada. I'd be...", "Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "I was going to let you explain it.", "Robert S. Sands", "We're not doing coconut beer, just to be clear.", "Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Fair. It would be innovative.", "Robert S. Sands", "You know, it really would be. But Chelada, just for everybody's information, if you're not familiar with it, is basically a combination of tomato juice or Clamato juice, Clamato juice and beer, and it's a typically consumed combination. And the answer is that, that's strictly a Crown innovation, although Modelo does have Cheladas in Mexico. So it is a Crown innovation for the U.S.", "Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Doesn't sound any worse than putting coconut juice in it.", "Robert S. Sands", "Well, it's actually quite tasty.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So my first question is on the beer business. When I think about your guidance, I think you said depletions and net sales are pretty much in line with each other, which I guess implies very little if not any pricing in 2014. And just given the cost inflation, I was just curious how you're thinking about pricing opportunity on Crown in 2014.", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes, I think what we said, Judy, is low to mid-single digits on the depletions and the net sales and mid-single digits on EBIT. As it relates to pricing, generally, we're just simply not going to comment on pricing, primarily because it's so uncertain, basically, at this point as to what's going to happen in the marketplace. But that said, we're obviously pretty confident in our guidance of low to mid-single-digit growth rate on the top line, which will put us in a position of gaining market share in beer once again, and we should be able to leverage that on the bottom line to mid-single-digit EBIT growth.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just thinking more of a medium- to long-term opportunity with capacity expansion in Piedras Negras, can you just maybe either qualitatively or just give us some color as to what kind of margins you think is more of an appropriate margin once you've moved all of the capacity into Piedras Negras and what's left in your sort of long-term assumption?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, Judy. This is Bob. So the way this will work, we have transition services agreement with InBev in order to secure the fact that we can keep the U.S. consumers happy with all our wonderful products. As we build out the Piedras Negras facility, the manufacturing will shift from InBev facilities to our own Piedras Negras facility. The Piedras Negras facility is very efficient, so it will be able to produce beer at a lower cost than we are buying that beer from InBev for. So over time, margins will improve because of that production shift from less efficient brewery to more efficient brewery. So you have that going on. Then you have the same dynamics that all the beer players have in what's going on with input cost, what's going on with brewery -- core brewery efficiencies, what's going on in U.S. pricing dynamics. But what's unique for us is the shift of production from InBev to Piedras Negras, and we expect that by the end of 3 years, we will be making all of our own beer, because as you get up to a $20 million (sic) [20 million] hectoliter capacity, that should be enough production capacity to last us, say, 5 to 7 years.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Got it. But your guidance for 2014 does not assume any of that benefit, because it's more medium- to long-term opportunity?", "Robert P. Ryder", "That's correct. There's a bit of efficiencies from some warehouse capital spend, but because of the late start to this year, most of the capital spend we're making will not result in increased production capacity. It will be like down payments on long lead time equipment, engineering, drawing, things like that.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And Bob, just on the free cash flow guidance, so -- and it relates to your leverage target. So if I hear you, you're saying, you're kind of in the low 5s today. In 2 years, you think that will step down to below kind of 4x, assuming with the free cash flow generation -- so it kind of implies maybe a free cash flow, ongoing free cash flow number of, say, maybe $700 million, $800 million per year versus this year, which, I guess, we're seeing somewhere around $475 million to $575 million. So can you kind of comment on what is sort of the right ongoing free cash flow number, and what's driving that step-up from this year into the next couple of years?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, I'd say, without giving specific numbers, the 2 big drivers will be reduced leverage and reduced interest expense, right, as we delever. Reduced capital spending, but that won't happen until like year 4, right, because we'll be spending capital on the brewery for years 1, 2, 3. And actually, year 2 and year 3 will be higher than year 1, right? And increased profits from the manufacturing of the beer, because we'll be making it in our facility versus InBev making it in theirs. And then add on to that, that our product categories are in high-margin, high-growth -- it's a high-margin, high-growth industry. And also, Judy, as we get past the first year, we'll most likely have lower onetime costs, right, because we have the initial financing fees and the initial kind of professional service and transition costs that are going to hit us next year, which I talked about in my script.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "The $80 million in total?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Correct. A total of $80 million.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Right. Okay. Understood.", "Robert P. Ryder", "Pretty big numbers, right, are going in our favor as we go forward. And you'll see that as we start to delever, we should get some very good free cash flow and EPS leverage as we move out into time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala of UBS.", "Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "On the spread between revenues and operating income for wine, is it that you're now in the second year maybe of your step-up of marketing promo and new product development and that you feel you still need to spend up for an additional 12 months, but we get to a point in the curve where we can start to see some operating leverage? Or is what you're seeing in the market simply that, in order to sustain this level of revenue growth, that it just requires this level of spending?", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes, I would say, Kaumil, it's the former, as you described it, which is that we're choosing to step up our investment this year again, really, to continue to drive the kind of momentum in our Focus Brands that we've achieved last year and as well to drive continued innovation. This year, we'll introduce approximately 25 new products/line extension SKUs, and this will require some additional investment, which is going to flow through the marketing line. We also, as I mentioned, do have the higher grape cost flowing through, but the plan is definitely to make these investments with a view towards translating that into P&L leverage at some point in the medium-term future. So we do expect these investments to pay back. We do think it's the right thing to do for the brands. We think it's the right thing to do for the company and the health of the brands and the company for the future. But we do anticipate them to be investments with a significant return, and we do expect that to translate into leverage in the future on the wine and spirits side.", "Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Got it. And then on the topic of grape pricing, it looks like, over the next 5 to 8 years or so, we're going to be going into a much tighter supply situation. How much -- how differently should we be looking at or thinking about the next 5 years in wine versus what the last 5 years have been, which, of course, have been during a period of oversupply? And what specifically does that mean for you guys?", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes, I think that it's actually going to benefit the big players on the wine side around the world that have established relations with growers, that have the capacity to purchase vineyards and generally will be the beneficiaries of moving into tighter supply. It will be the smaller and the more marginal players that will potentially be hurt to the greater -- greatest degree because they simply don't have the clout and the leverage and the relationships to overcome the shortages. Now that said, we're not expecting the market to turn from oversupply to severe shortage. These things are usually overstated in the media and the press. I think last year was a good example of that, the 2012 harvest. Or when you look at sort of how things transpired from 2011 to 2012, 2011 was a little short. Everybody cried wolf, and there was going to be a grape shortage. It turned out not to be a grape shortage. 2012 turned out to be the largest harvest in California that we've ever had. There's actually plenty of wine and juice around. It remains to see how 2013 will play out. If you look around the world, Europe had a bad harvest, so there's some shortages there. Australia continues to be in oversupply; South Africa, oversupply; California is sort of balanced; South America, balanced, depending on exactly where you're talking about. So it's some and some. So you can't read the press and get too excited about it, because it tends to exaggerate both the oversupply and it tends to exaggerate the undersupply. So we don't really see, in either the short term or the medium term, anything happening that is, I'll say, terribly unexpected or that will impact our operating results in a more material way than we've indicated.", "Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, got it. And then very quickly on taxes. You were at, I believe, 26% fiscal 2012. You're looking for 37%. It's a big jump. Is it simply that there were some credits that disappear and no longer exist, or is there a chance for that 37% to be lower for fiscal '13, fiscal '14 for you?", "Robert P. Ryder", "As you know, Kaumil, over the last 4 or 5 years, we've had some favorable outcomes in our tax rate, and our effective tax rate is probably, average, maybe 30% or even below that. Last year was a very low rate. What those 5 years included were some positive outcomes from foreign tax credits, okay? Now before this acquisition that we're talking about, we had a lot of foreign operations historically, but this year would have drained all those foreign tax credits. So we would not have had any more going forward, okay? This would have been the last year of those positives. For the beer transaction, we've essentially given guidance at the statutory tax rate. It will not be worse than that. Because the beer transaction is so new, we haven't baked in any potential tax rate upside, so -- if there even is any. We don't know if there even is any. So we'll be keeping people advised of this as we go forward. The tax rate shouldn't get worse, but it also may not get better.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alice Longley of Buckingham Research.", "Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "I have a question about Crown's sales in the fourth quarter. I think they were up 1%. Can you break out how much that was hurt by the calendar, how much St. Pauli Girl, how much weather? I suspect that hurt you some in February. And then how much pricing was in the 1%?", "Robert P. Ryder", "So you're correct. The beer industry had a, if people remember, had a very strong end last year, volumes were very good, so we were -- and we participated in that. So we were overlapping a positive period in the prior year. In addition, in the fourth quarter, there were 2 fewer selling days in this year's fourth quarter versus last year's fourth quarter, right? So that doesn't seem like a lot, but it is in a quarter, right? And you are correct, we did not have St. Pauli Girl this year. We -- I don't know -- I don't think we had it in last year's fourth quarter either. On a full year basis, St. Pauli Girl, this year, we sold a little less than 1 million cases. In the previous year, we sold probably twice that, a little bit more than 2 million cases. So there was some St. Pauli Girl overlap. In the grand scheme of things, St. Pauli Girl was not a big piece of our business. So I'd say that the big pieces were the selling days and the positive -- the overlap of the positive weather in the previous year. Now that was our reported sales, right? As you'll see, we still did fine on earnings in the fourth quarter. I think they were up 4%. And if you look at IRI or market trends, we were still doing great, so it was really just as we look at shipments year-over-year and allotted shipment day influence.", "Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Would you guess that, adjusted for those items, maybe your sales would've been up 3% to 4%?", "Robert P. Ryder", "I haven't done that calculation, so...", "Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "And was there any pricing in there?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Well, the only pricing is there -- in there -- and remember, we took pricing, as did the rest of the beer industry, but we took less, in October of calendar '12, right? So that pricing move is a positive margin enhancement throughout fiscal '14 as well. So it's a positive in the fourth quarter fiscal '13 and throughout fiscal '14 that will carry through, and that is part of the reason why our guidance is that operating profits will grow more than net sales -- and in volumes.", "Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "And I think you indicated before that maybe that pricing is averaging about 2%? Is that, what -- did you get that in the fourth quarter?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, in October, we took pricing of just under 2%. That's across our total portfolio, and the pricing was very different by geographies and by SKU. But in general, it was just under 2%.", "Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Okay. And just one other question. The ad ratio for the company overall is -- I know that you're investing in it, but is the ratio going to be up? Or is it just going to -- is the advertising just going to be up in line with sales?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, advertising in total and advertising as a percentage of sales will be up in the Wine and Spirits business. And it's still, in the Wine and Spirits business, still not a huge number. It's between 4% and 5%. So in fiscal '12, it was closer to 4% -- I'm sorry, fiscal '13, it was closer to 4%. Fiscal '14 will be closer to 5%. In the Beer business, there's a lot more advertising. It's more like 8% of sales. That will be consistent in fiscal '14 versus what it was in fiscal '13.", "Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Are you going to break out the sales in...", "Robert P. Ryder", "Sorry, go ahead.", "Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Right. And are you going to be breaking out sales and profits for Wine and Spirits versus Beer going ahead? Are we going to see the 2 separately?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes. Most likely, what our segments reporting will look like is, you will have a Beer segment, which will include what we currently call Crown plus the brewery, right, so that will be a complete segment from buying the raw materials through selling through to the distributors, okay? And we will continue with our Wine and Spirits segment and our corporate segments. That's most likely. We haven't completely landed on that, but that's probably what we will have.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust.", "Sarah Miller", "This is Sarah Miller on for Bill. Our question today is kind of around the Beer business or the Wine business. The 8% organic growth that you posted this time seems to be -- well, it's higher than what you've been posting in recent years. I'm just kind of wondering, was there anything in particular that drove that higher level? Was there a specific brand? And could you give us some color around whether this is sustainable going forward?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Sure. The fourth quarter, as Rob said in his script, the fourth quarter had very good top line results for wine. Now there's a lot of seasonality involved, and as we said in the scripts, too, you should look at the full year versus the quarter. But the fourth quarter's a big quarter in the Wine and Spirits business, so we had a lot of our promotional and sales focus on the fourth quarter. In addition, a lot of the new product introductions, and as Rob said, there were about 50, really started to gain additional distribution as we entered the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth quarter. So they had much better distribution in the fourth quarter this year versus the fourth quarter of last year. So I'd say it was promotional and sales execution focus in that time period and increased distribution for our new products were the 2 big drivers.", "Sarah Miller", "I mean, do you foresee that staying pretty similar going forward, to be able to sustain this higher level of sales?", "Robert P. Ryder", "No. As we said in our guidance, we expect wine and spirits sales to be in the mid-single digit for fiscal '14, all right? I'd encourage everybody to look at the full year results versus the individual quarters.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I guess a few questions. Rob, it sounds like once you get past fiscal '14, you still feel pretty good about the Wine and Spirits business's ability to put out mid-single-digit-type EBIT growth. Is that still your long-term view of that business?", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and then, sorry?", "Robert S. Sands", "I said yes.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And on Piedras Negras, can you speak to procurement specifically? It seems like the point of debate out there, and you guys seem to have some scale you could actually bring to the advantage of your -- that business's procurement needs. Is it -- when you think about what the current procurement costs are of that business and how they might unfold in the future once you have ownership and, ultimately, full production there, is that an advantage you bring to the business? Or is it an advantage that goes away? I mean, Modelo's not -- doesn't seem like it's the strongest at procurement as it could be, so can you just speak to that topic?", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes, we think that, generally, Mark, it will be an advantage to the business on all of the -- or on the major components of COGS, okay? So one of the major components of COGS, the major components of COGS in the Beer business are glass and freight, which constitute about 70% of total COGS, okay? And the -- when we look at the potentiality of combining some of our Wine and Spirits procurement activities around, as I said, those components, we do think that it's got the potential of being advantageous to the business. Some of the smaller areas of COGS, malt, hops, crowns, things to this effect, cans, should be relatively neutral. But the major components, we may have some advantage.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "That's great. And I don't know if June 5 is too soon, but when we -- as we think about June 5, and whether it's procurement or this topic that, Bob, you were talking about, the advantages of putting all of the production into one facility over the next few years, I mean, are we going to -- are you going to lay out for us kind of a view of the kind of the 3-year pro forma scenario of what this new entity that, from a beer perspective, will look like? Are we going to speak kind of more qualitatively? Is it something that comes at year -- have you -- how are you thinking about how you choose to communicate on what might be achieved here, ultimately?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, I think we won't be giving details 3 years because, as you said, it's just too early. But we will be giving some flavor about -- around what we look like when we -- how much free cash flow can this thing generate, what are the COGS makeups, how, are we advantaged, disadvantaged. We will be giving additional flavor around the beer transaction. We'll also be spending a reasonable amount of time around the marketing end of both wine and beer, with a lot of focus around new product introductions and some focus around sales execution and some of the things we have cooking there and some of the processes that we've put in place. Because as Rob said, look, we're fortunate to be in, I'll say, fast-growing, high-margin categories, right? High-end imported beer, premium wine, premium spirits. And our goal is to maintain or grow share in those categories, right, which ends up with a pretty nice top line. And as Rob said, we hope to have the bottom line growing at or better than the top line in the reasonable near future. So I don't think we'll be giving detailed 3-year financials, but we'll be talking around those themes.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "That's great. That's very helpful. And then finally, just thinking about the cash flow profile of the business 2 years out, obviously, a lot higher than what it's been historically. The leverage comes down. You're now, as you say, kind of multi-category. You're comparatively small in Spirits, much larger in Beer and Wine. Do you think Spirits becomes a higher priority in terms of your acquisition interests? Do you continue to be more focused on Wine and Beer? I mean, as you think about those 3 categories, how does your thinking about emphasis change?", "Robert P. Ryder", "It's a little hard to judge. It -- clearly, Wine and Beer would be areas that make logical sense. However -- and Spirits, for that matter, makes a lot of sense. We like the Spirits business. We'd like to be bigger in the Spirits business, but it's really all a function of what opportunities are out there and the economics of those opportunities. First and foremost, we've got to get this deal closed. We've got a few years of deleveraging to focus on. That will go pretty quickly due to the strong cash flow generation of the underlying business. And then, as it relates to acquisition opportunities, all 3 categories are fertile ground for that, but we're not going to overpay. We're not going to break our financial discipline. And I think that the good thing is that we have a lot of opportunity to generate organic growth through innovation, really, in all 3 categories, but particularly so in Beer, with our own state-of-the-art brewery and the kind of production capacity that we're putting in. We're designing that so that we can innovate in the high end of the beer market and create, craft, style beers, for instance, that can take advantage of the growth in the high-end segment of the beer market, much along the lines of what we're doing with Rick Bayless. So a lot of opportunity there, and you're already seeing the innovation and the effect of the innovation we're doing on the Wine side, where wine innovation constituted almost 6% of our sales in FY '13, which is pretty similar or pretty much spot-on with what the wine market overall did in general. And we've really stepped up our innovation on the Spirits side, which we're seeing some extremely positive momentum from, particularly on the addition of our new flavors. We're going to be driving that, because the flavor segment of the vodka category is really where all of the really strong growth is. And it's a much smaller segment of the vodka category than people really think. It's only about 20% of the vodka category, but you go out there and look at what's on the shelves, okay, and it's actually astounding as to how much shelf space is being devoted to flavors in the vodka category versus what we call the straight 80 proof, which is the non-flavored version. And interestingly enough, the flavored category has even better margins than the non-flavored category. And what's going in brown spirits and flavors completely reinvigorated the brown spirits category. It's completely reinvigorated Black Velvet. I mean, that was a relatively mature brand that, historically, we would not have slated for a lot of growth. I mean, the Canadian Whisky category, which was kind of lackluster, flattish to down-ish in that particular price point, but with the introduction of our flavors, the Toasted Caramel and the introduction of the Cinnamon Rush, we're seeing very, very strong growth in that category as well. So a lot of opportunity on the organic side, and we will take advantage of acquisition opportunities as they come along in all 3 categories, but we're not going to break our financial discipline and overpay, okay, just to make deals, especially in the context of how much opportunity exists on the organic side.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "That's great. So Cinnamon Hot SVEDKA, sounds like that's next on the list.", "Robert S. Sands", "Now you're getting all these flavors confused. We're not doing coconut beer, and we're not doing cinnamon SVEDKA. That was tomato juice and beer, okay, and cinnamon whisky.", "Robert P. Ryder", "You guys must be mixing your own cocktails, so I...", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "So we're not going to be see a V8 SVEDKA any time soon? That's good.", "Robert S. Sands", "You never know.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Robert Ottenstein of ISI.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "A couple of questions on the -- what is obviously a new and important Beer business for you. You've done a great job, obviously, commercially in what's been a marketing business for the most part so far. And now you've got a huge plant, you've got supply chains. Is there a plan to bring in a CFO, if you will, a CEO, if you will, for the Beer business? Any new management there to help kind of put everything together and who will be responsible for the returns?", "Robert P. Ryder", "So we've got a very strong team of people that we're acquiring with the Piedras Negras brewery who are very successfully operating the brewery at the current time. We don't expect any change in employment with respect to the team that's operating that brewery. Obviously, we've got a very strong Crown team that's been responsible for the sales and marketing of that portfolio for almost 20 years and has built that business into what it is today. And in general, in the company, we have a very strong supply chain organization that operates more than 36 wineries and distilleries around the entire world and thousands and thousands of employees, of which many of them came out of the brewing industry as well as spirits and wine. We are assembling a team of people that'll be comprised of existing Crown personnel, existing Constellation production personnel, as well as some new personnel that will also be involved in the oversight of the expansion of the Piedras Negras brewery as well as operations in general. But that said, I can't overemphasize the fact that we are acquiring a very, very strong team of people that are currently very successfully operating that brewery. And by the way, not only are they very -- currently very successfully operating the brewery, but this is the team of people who built the brewery besides. It's a brand-new brewery. It was only commissioned, and it's only been operating for a couple of years. And so we have all of the resources that have gone into building this, and we  negotiated transition services arrangements with ABI to ensure that we would have their expertise going forward over the next 3 years as we integrate the brewery into our production operations as well.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So -- but who specifically will be responsible and held accountable for the -- now the total earnings profit of the Beer business?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, well, #1, I'm specifically accountable and responsible for the earnings of the Beer, Wine and Spirits business. And then underneath me, of course, we do have a very strong team of people who are responsible for the overall business. But Bill Hackett, okay, is the President of the Beer business, and he is the person who is primarily responsible for delivering the beer results. But he will be working very closely as well with the Crown supply chain side of the business that reports to him as well as the overall Constellation supply chain side of the business, which will be responsible, as I said, for oversight of the brewery and expansion of the brewery. So Bill Hackett is the person responsible for beer profit.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. Second, if you go through, I guess, some of your SEC filings this week, there's some discussion, a way of continuing government oversight, I guess, to get to the 20 million hectoliters over the next 3 years. Is there any other government oversight expected here in terms of, on the commercial side, in terms of minimum amounts of marketing or advertising or anything along those lines, after everything's done, of further government oversight?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, the answer to that is no. The government oversight is focused on the build-out of the Piedras Negras brewery over the next 3 years and ensuring that the milestones that we've set forth are met and the expansion is completed so that the production is -- so that the production aspect of our Beer business is entirely independent at the end of the 3-year period. That's the sole focus of the DOJ or government oversight. The commercial side of the business is completely under our control, period.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Terrific. And then just one last question. I think we all appreciate and look forward to looking at the kind of efficiencies that you're going to get at Piedras Negras, and I've heard wonderful things about that plant. And obviously, you've got some potential to drive margins there. How should we think of, if any, is there any -- going to be any incremental cost in terms of logistics supplying the United States out of 1 market as opposed to what's today, I believe, 3 different plants that would have different geographic locations and different costs, just in terms of getting the product to market?", "Robert P. Ryder", "No, it's the opposite. There'll be lower logistics costs in supplying from the Piedras Negras brewery, which is only 13 miles south of the Texas border and, therefore, closer to the U.S. market than any other plant that -- or brewery that was previously supplying the U.S.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher of JPMorgan.", "John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just wanted to ask 2 questions. First off, can you give us an idea in terms of, if we look at the $310 million that you talked about in February versus the $370 million now, that's obviously a pretty big increase. I mean, do you have some sort of clue in terms of what came in better from that regard and how we should think about that from a comparison issue as you cycle against that? And then, from a currency standpoint, you talked about the impact of FX. As we look at sort of you guys going into Mexico at this point, I'm assuming this is just basically a straight translation of your peso-based costs. And can you tell us what percentage of your costs, as you produce at Piedras Negras, are going to be in pesos versus dollars?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes. So I would encourage everybody to just kind of forget about the $310 million. And the $310 million was just an estimate at the time, so that the number we feel that would be at $370 million, it could actually be a slightly different number when the audit finally figures out. And remember, all that number represents is the translated peso profits from calendar '12 of the manufacturing of beer to be sold to Crown, right? So that is a base, and I tried to give some guidance as to how we think that will pan out in '14. Regarding the foreign exchange, actually, the beer industry, the majority of input costs are U.S. dollar-based, things like glass, aluminum, even like hops and barley and things like that. So really, the big foreign exchange exposure is the labor in the brewery is just the big, I'd say, transactional exposure because, of course, you're paying the employees in pesos, and you ultimately sell the product in dollars. Of course, there's a reasonable amount of depreciation at the brewery, which is also peso-denominated, but that's more -- that's translation versus transaction, because there's really no cash involved. So as you -- as you get down -- well, and the other thing I'll say is, so Day 1, when we're buying, say, 30%, 40% of our volumes from InBev, okay, as we buy those finished products from them, that is a dollar-denominated transaction. We will pay them in dollars, right, so we have no foreign exchange exposure. As we move towards producing at the Piedras Negras brewery, our foreign exchange exposure will increase, all right, because we'll be hiring more labor there, so -- and that will be peso-denominated. So over time, that will increase. But in the grand scheme of things, the foreign exchange exposure for our Beer business is not -- percentage-wise, isn't going to be that large, okay? Now the COGS number is a big number, right? It's $1.5 billion to $2 billion, depending how much volume you say it is. But there's probably only about 25% to 35% of that is peso-denominated.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.", "Mariya Golub - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "This is actually Mariya Golub. A couple of questions on my end. In terms of your free cash flow outlook for $475 million to $575 million, what are your working cap assumptions for 2014? And does it factor in sort of a more normalized level of bulk wine purchases versus last year?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes. Our working capital assumptions for '14 aren't dramatically different from '13. The -- it is a higher use of working capital, simply because the business is growing. I'd say our metrics are similar. We're assuming a harvest in, I'll say, fiscal '14 to be similar to the harvest in fiscal '13, so -- and we expect cost of grapes to be, again, up a little bit, cost per ton. But I would say that working capital isn't a huge driver in the year-over-year delta of free cash flow. Of course, the beer transaction is the big driver, and onetime cost and all that kind of stuff.", "Mariya Golub - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it. And then, how should we think about the post-closing purchase price adjustment and sort of how that flows through to 2015? Will there be a step-up in interest expense then relative to 2014?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Well, in 2015, we expect to fund it out the of existing cash for the revolver, right? So if it were to occur, of course, our interest expense will be lower. But we have that in our whole financing scheme. We will not have to go to the market to borrow more money. We will be able to do that from the facilities that we are raising right at this moment.", "Mariya Golub - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it. And then just final one for me, just on Crown Imports. Is there anything else that's -- besides pricing that's driving the positive delta between sales and OI growth for 2014? Because if I take a look at that business over the past several years, OI and Crown Imports has actually lagged sales.", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, I'd say it's the pricing we took in October of calendar '12 is a piece, and some efficiencies throughout the rest of the business will be another driver. But the pricing was certainly a big piece.", "Operator", "That does conclude the Q&A portion of today's call. I will now turn the floor over to Rob Sands for closing remarks.", "Robert S. Sands", "Well, thank you, all, for joining our call today. As I mentioned, I am very excited about the prospect of finalizing the Beer transaction and integrating 100% of the Crown business and the Piedras Negras brewery with Constellation. This deal is a game changer for us, significantly enhancing our financial profile and providing new avenues for growth. I am also excited about our plans for fiscal 2014. As we enter the new year, we have great marketplace momentum across our Beer, Wine and Spirits businesses, and we are poised for solid execution of our goals for the year.", "Now as I mentioned, we will be hosting an Investor Conference in New York City on June 5, and I look forward to seeing many of you there at that time. So thanks, again, for your participation in our conference call.", "Operator", "Thank you. That does conclude today's Constellation Brands Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Constellation's First Quarter Fiscal 2014 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release, which has also been also been furnished to the SEC.", "During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable, organic and constant currency basis.

Sands", "Thanks, Patty. Before we get started, I'd like to thank those of you who attended our recent New York City Investors Meeting. I hope one of your key takeaways from that meeting is that we are definitely a new Constellation.", "The powerful combination of our existing wine and spirits business with our newly consolidated beer business, including our New Mexican brewery and the other 50% of Crown, adds an entirely new dimension to our company, one that adds size and scale and provides new avenues for growth. Since the closing of the beer deal less than a month ago, we have experienced a smooth transition for our new brewery in Mexico.", "Our beer supply chain is operating efficiently as we continue to make and move beer. And we are fully engaged in working collaboratively with all brewery employees, including the operations team in Mexico. Overall, we're off to a good start for the year on all fronts, with results that were generally in line with all of our expectations.", "During the first quarter, our U.S. wine and spirits business continue to gain marketplace momentum, posting strong consumer takeaway growth of 9% versus category growth of 3% in IRI channels. In terms of consumer takeaway by market channel, Constellation's wine portfolio outperformed the category overall due to solid growth across every channel.", "Overall, we continue to benefit from continuing consumer trade-up trends, distribution gains at retail and contributions from our brand-building efforts, with our Focus Brands depletions growing at more than double the rate of our total portfolio during the quarter.", "Now I'd like to take a moment to highlight some of our key brand-building initiatives that were executed during the first quarter, including accolades received for some of our popular wines and spirits. The Dreaming Tree, which is one of our most successful new brand introductions to date, launched an everyday White Blend named after a song made famous by Dave Matthews. It is the perfect companion to the Crush Red Blend that was introduced last year.", "Building on the success of their frozen wine cocktails, Arbor Mist expanded and launched frozen spirits-style cocktails, including strawberry daiquiri, pi\u00f1a colada and lime margarita.", "Wine Enthusiasts recently awarded 90-plus points scores to several Ravenswood designate series Zinfandel wines. And the Robert Mondavi 2010 Napa Valley Fume Blanc recently received 91 points and the best buy accolade from Wine & Spirits Magazine. The month of June was dedicated to Robert Mondavi as heritage month as we celebrate his legacy and the 100th anniversary of his birth.", "Throughout the month, we featured special sales promotions, marketing campaigns and events for Robert Mondavi wines in an effort to celebrate his great contributions to the wine world, including many fine winemaking techniques and the creation of marketing and educational innovations that enhance the worldwide reputation of Napa Valley and California wines.", "We recently achieved an important milestone within our wine business by becoming the #1 wine producer and exporter of New Zealand wines with our award-winning portfolio of brands, including Kim Crawford, Nobilo and Monkey Bay. Throughout the last 52 weeks, these brands posted strong double-digit growth trends in the IRI channels. During the quarter, Kim Crawford also had the distinction of reaching the 1 million case mark in global sales over a 12-month period.", "From the spirits perspective, during the first quarter, both SVEDKA Vodka and Black Velvet Canadian Whisky posted double-digit consumer takeaway trends in IRI channels in addition to gaining market share of their respective market categories. Just in time for Memorial Day celebrations, we released SVEDKA Stars & Stripes 2, our limited-edition 1.75 liter party bottle, which will certainly come in handy for this week's 4th of July celebrations. SVEDKA has become the #2 imported vodka and the #3 vodka overall in the U.S. It also recently moved up to #7 on Impact magazine's list of top 10 distilled spirits brands in the U.S.", "We also recently launched the new Black Velvet Cinnamon Rush, which can be enjoyed straight, on the rocks or blended in a handcrafted cocktail and is priced at a premium versus our base Black Velvet brand. The cinnamon flavor category in whisky is currently on fire, experiencing triple-digit growth trends.", "Moving to Crown Imports in our beer business. For the first quarter of 2014, Crown posted its 13th consecutive quarter of share gains and outperformance of the total U.S. beer industry and imported beer category, gaining almost 1 point of volume share of the import category. This was the result of excellent execution during the Cinco de Mayo and Memorial Day holidays.", "Modelo Especial continues to be the shining star of the portfolio, posting double-digit sales in depletion growth trends during the quarter. Collectively, Corona Extra and the entire Modelo portfolio posted depletion trends that exceeded the overall U.S. beer market in the first quarter, benefiting from increased marketing investments, which include: Corona Extra launched 4 new Find Your Beach advertisements, reinforcing Corona's leadership position, demonstrating that finding your beach can be a state of mind, as well as a physical place.", "Corona Light also launched a new advertising campaign during the quarter that encourages consumers to trade up from domestic lights. You may remember some of these spots that we showed at our recent Investor Meeting featured the talking sheep, which encouraged consumers to ditch the herd. Overall, this brand is outpacing the imported light category in IRI channels.", "Following Cinco activities, we launched the \"Live it. Share it. Win it.\" summer promotion for Corona Extra and Corona Light, which is supported by new TV and digital spots. Modelo Especial has new creative for both Hispanic and general market consumers that plays to the beer's authenticity.", "Collectively, the initiatives I have just outlined contributed to Crown's strong marketplace momentum as the business grew depletions by approximately 3% in the first quarter despite a difficult comparison overlap from last year's first quarter. Throughout the remainder of the year, Crown plans to launch Modelo Especial Chelada by early fall, which is expected to build in the brand strength of Modelo Especial. This product will tap into a new occasion with this brand's core Hispanic consumer.", "Crown is planning draft format expansions for Corona Light, Negra Modelo and Pacifico in select markets. Corona Light will also sponsor Kenny Chesney's 2013 U.S. tour, leveraging Kroger as the strategic retail partner through its Rhythms & Brews program.", "Pacifico will debut its first TV ads in Southern California. The new Pacifico, discovered in Baja, imported by surfers, campaign includes several TV ads that celebrate the brand's surfing origins and adventure-seeking consumers.", "And finally, during fiscal 2014, chef Rick Bayless will work with Crown to promote Negra Modelo, Pacifico and Victoria, creating recipes and unique food pairing options for each brand that can be leveraged at retail.", "In closing, from an operational perspective, we are off to a positive start for the year, gaining market share across our beer, wine and spirits businesses in IRI channels. I am particularly pleased that we have closed the beer deal and that a smooth transition is underway at our new brewery in Mexico. As you know, we have been working diligently to build a solid and sustainable foundation of operational excellence, financial strength and innovation, and we expect to continue in these areas throughout the remainder of the year.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our first quarter results.", "Robert P. Ryder", "Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Our comparable basis diluted EPS for Q1 came in at $0.38. At a high level, this result was generally in line with our expectations, and we are reiterating, or in the case of EPS, improving our full year guidance. We're pleased with our marketplace results as our wine, spirits and beer businesses continue to gain share in IRI for the quarter from our brand-building investments, innovation efforts and retail execution.", "For Q1, sales growth did not translate to higher EBIT due primarily to some timing items. In a few moments, I will highlight some additional timing and comparison impacts for Q2. As a result, we expect this year's profit growth to be generated in the back half of the year.", "Given those highlights, let's look at Q1 performance in more detail quarter, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our news release, wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 4%, primarily due to higher shipment volume. We saw shipments outpace depletions in the quarter as our U.S. domestic depletion volume growth was a little above 2%. In Q2, we expect this shipment benefit to reverse, and we expect depletion growth to be quite a bit higher than Q1.", "As a reminder, from time-to-time, we will see fluctuations in growth trends between shipments and depletions on a quarter-over-quarter basis due to various factors like timing of new product introductions and promotional activities. But from an overall standpoint, we continue to expect shipments and depletions to generally align on an annual basis. The acquisition of Mark West provided contribution to our total growth as total net sales for the quarter increased 6%.", "For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 38.3% versus 39.6% for the prior year quarter. This reflect -- this result reflects an increase in COGS, driven primarily by higher grape cost. Wine and spirits segment operating income decreased $5 million to $128 million as sales growth was more than offset by the impact of higher grape and SG&A costs.", "The increase in SG&A was in line with our expectations and reflects compensation increases and commercial investments in the business. We expect to continue to see higher SG&A as we move through the year from this activity, along with planned marketing investment behind initiatives for some of our key focus brands.", "Corporate costs increased less than $1 million for the quarter. Equity earnings for Crown totaled $66 million versus $61 million last year. For the quarter, Crown generated net sales of $762 million, an increase of 5%; and operating income of $134 million, an increase of 9%. The net sales and operating increase was primarily driven by volume growth, led by strong double-digit growth of Modelo Especial and the benefit of increased product pricing taken in select U.S. markets last fall.", "Interest expense for the quarter was $55 million, up 8% versus last year. The increase was primarily due to higher average debt balances. That provides a good spot to discuss our debt position, which saw quite a bit of activity during Q1 related to the financing of the beer transaction. At the end of May, our total debt was just over $5 billion. This represents a $1.8 billion increase from our debt level at the end of fiscal 2013.", "The increase reflects some of the permanent financing that was executed in May in advance of the completion of the $4.75 billion beer business acquisition that closed on June 7th. This included $500 million of 3.75% senior notes due in 2021, $1 billion of 4.25% senior notes due 2023 and about $221 million drawn from our accounts receivables securitization and other revolving facilities. We funded the remainder of the purchase price with cash, term loans and borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which were not drawn or utilized until after the close of the first quarter.", "The timing of this financing activity could not have been better. Our improved credit profile, combined with the favorable interest rate environment, helped us put in place an attractive financing package with an all-in interest rate just under 3%. This was better than our original expectations. And as a result, we now expect interest expense for the year to be in the range of $325 million to $335 million versus our original $345 million to $355 million projection. We still do not have full visibility to the timing of the brewery cash flows, and the current interest rate outlook remains quite volatile. Right now, this is our best estimate.", "We also finished May with $609 million of cash on our balance sheet and a little over $1.5 billion of restricted cash. The higher-than-normal cash balance primarily relates to the building funds and drawing against our AR securitization facility for the beer acquisition activities. The restricted cash relates the senior note issuances I just outlined.", "After factoring in the cash and restricted cash, our net debt at the end of May was $2.9 billion, and our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio came in at about 3.2x. Our comparable base effective tax rate came in at 36.2% for Q1, and this was essentially even with the prior year Q1 rate.", "Now let's discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For Q1, we used $19 million of free cash flow, which compares to $77 million of free cash flow generation for Q1 of last year. The decrease was primarily due to funding beer transaction-related costs, higher interest expense payments and the impact of GAAP reporting on equity-based compensation.", "Our cash flow statement reflects excess cash benefits realized from stock benefit compensation awards as a reduction of cash from operating activities, offset by a benefiting cash from financing activities. So for the quarter, there is no net impact to our cash position, but there is a negative impact on our reported free cash flow.", "This is not a new reporting requirement, but it is noteworthy this quarter as we have seen a significant number of option exercises, given the substantial appreciation in our stock price over the past year. While the accounting and reporting for this area is very technical, the tax benefit associated with this activity ultimately reduces the income taxes paid by the company.", "Now let's move to our full year fiscal 2014 outlook. We're now forecasting comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.90 a share. This represents a $0.05 increase versus our previous guidance and is being driven by the lower interest expense projection I outlined earlier. This projection excludes any acquisition accounting impact. We continue to forecast free cash flow in the range of $475 million to $575 million.", "For our wine and spirits business, we continue to target organic revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range and low to mid-single digit operating income growth. For the beer business, Crown continues to target depletions and net sales growth in the low to mid-single-digit range.", "Operating income for Crown before any benefits from beer manufacturing and brand right profits is expected to be in the mid-single-digit range. We do not have any updates to our previous discussions related to the fiscal '14 incremental benefits that we are targeting from the beer manufacturing and brand rights profit stream. Our guidance also continues to assume a tax rate of 37% and weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 199 million.", "I would like to note that from a gaining perspective, we expect fiscal 2014 Q2 EBIT performance for wine and spirits to come in below Q2 of fiscal 2013. As mentioned earlier, we saw shipments in Q1 outpace depletions, and we expect this shipment benefit to reverse in Q2. We also expect a portion of our planned incremental marketing investments for some of our key Focus Brands to occur in Q2.", "From a Crown perspective, this is before any brewery or brand owner benefits, we expect operating growth in Q2 to be flattish versus Q2 last year. We are overlapping Q2 fiscal 2013 income from an early termination payment related to the St. Pauli Girl distribution agreement. We also expect an increase in marketing expense in Q2 as marketing spend that historically occurred in the back half of the year is shifted into Q2 to further support the key summer selling season.", "Our comparable basis guidance excludes restructuring charges and unusual items, which are detailed on the last page of the release. The onetime costs associated with the beer transaction are expected to approximate $80 million in fiscal 2014. This includes approximately $50 million, primarily related to professional services and transition costs associated with the transaction, and $30 million of costs for financing-related fees. I would like to emphasize that the onetime costs and tax rate projections factored into the guidance I just highlighted are based on preliminary estimates.", "As noted earlier, our guidance excludes any acquisition accounting impact. While the purchase price allocation and acquisition accounting activities are underway, I would like to note that the disclosures related to this area in our upcoming 10-Q filing will be preliminary and subject to finalization. The initial purchase price for the beer transaction is $4.75 billion. This includes $1.85 billion for the remaining interest in Crown and $2.9 billion for the brewery and perpetual brand rights.", "As previously discussed, we estimate there will be a post-closing adjustment payment of approximately $560 million related to the brewery EBITDA calculation. This payment is expected to occur about 12 months after close. The purchase price allocation is expected to result in a significant increase in goodwill recorded on our balance sheet. This includes a significant noncash gain from the revaluation of our original 50% ownership interest in Crown to reflect the newly established fair market value. This gain is essentially nontaxable. And as a result, we expect this accounting requirement to result in a very low reported effective tax rate for the year.", "Before we take your questions, I would like to reiterate a few key highlights as it relates to the completion of the beer transaction. This is truly transformational for us as it diversifies our consumer base, essentially doubles annual sales and significantly enhances operating profits and operating margins. The brewery expansion activities over the next 3 years should position us for additional beer margin enhancement opportunities.", "Although our leverage will move above 5x range when factoring in a full year of acquisition earnings, we expect to focus on debt paydown to delever at a good pace, and we expect to be below 4x in approximately 2 years. As we delever and complete the brewery expansion, we expect to see a dramatic increase in our free cash flow generation. This should provide us with significant financial and capital allocation flexibility.", "With that, we're happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.", "William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "I was wondering if you could talk a little bit on the grape cost, both in the quarter and kind of looking forward. And when I'm looking at gross margin, was the decline year-over-year almost all because of the higher grape cost or was there a higher promotion? And then would you expect this type of impact throughout 2014 or should it ease as we get to the back end?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, so I'll take that in pieces. So the grape cost flowing through the cost of goods sold this year are pretty much as expected, right, as we -- because the last 2 harvests in California, specifically the cost per ton had gone up, though that juice will be flowing through our cost of goods sold over the next year to 2. So the cost of goods sold is up. But to your point, for the quarter, promotion spending was up a bit, mostly due to some of the timing of the shipments versus depletions. For the full year, we don't expect promotion spending to be up except for the impact of positive mix. So do we do expect cost of goods sold to be up for the year, and that was part of our guidance. We do not expect promotion spending on a mix adjusted basis to be up for the full year, but we did have a reasonable amount of quarter-over-quarter volatility.", "William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just on the beer side, was there any impact in terms of weather on the overall top line? And then have you seen any change as weather has improved in the summer?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, so that's a great question. And we're very happy with our beer results. We outpaced the industry again for the 13th consecutive quarter. That being said, our results on the East Coast and in the Midwest were not very good because the weather for the spring has actually been very wet and very cold, and that's overlapping the previous year, where the weather was actually beyond ideal. So the whole beer industry had a very good first quarter last year. This year, we're all kind of suffering. We're not unique in that. But in general, we're doing better than most. And we're hoping for better weather as we come into the peak summer season, which is right now.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Citi.", "Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I wanted to circle back on the commentary about the reversals in terms of the shipments and depletions. I guess, I was a little surprised to hear that you get a full reversal in the second quarter. Because it looks like in the wine business, your shipments have been running ahead of depletions for 4 or 5 quarters now. It wasn't just kind of a 1Q '14 event. So can you dig a little deeper into that?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, Vivien, the quarter-over-quarter thing gets a little confusing and complicated to describe, especially when you're talking changes, right, because you have to take 2 years activities into account. But the way we look at it is there is volatility quarter-over-quarter, but it kind of clears up on an annual basis. So I think if you go back and look at last year, for the full fiscal year, shipments and depletions were pretty much in line, actually they have been for the last few years. But the quarter volatility does exist.", "Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Fair enough. And then I wanted to follow up on Bill's question about promotional spending. As I look at -- and I don't have the IRI data that you guys note. I'm using Nielsen AOC. But it looks to me that after significant easing in category level promotional spending, that's really kind of eased off and actually picked up recently. So I'm curious whether you're seeing that on a category basis in IRI, if you're seeing a shift in promotional spending from your competitive set.", "Robert P. Ryder", "We feel we're spending in line with the industry. Again, a lot of our growth is coming out of the premium IRI segment, right, and we're making a concerted effort to get behind some of our brands there. And we're certainly spending more of our money on Focus Brands. But I think Q1 wouldn't be reflective of what we expect for the full year, especially when you look at some year-over-year indices.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.", "Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "I have a follow-up question on the difference between depletions and shipments in wine and spirits. I think you said in the second quarter, your depletions would improve significantly from up 2%, so I guess maybe up 4% or something like that. Could you, first of all, comment on why that improves? And then if there's a reversal, does that mean your shipments are up 2%?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes. And again, it can drive you a little bit crazy quarter-over-quarter. So the second quarter will kind of even out some of the anomalies in the first quarter because there'll be a reversal of the trends. So shipment growth, right, will be a lot less than depletion growth in the second quarter, which was the opposite in the first quarter. And again, for the full year, they should align. So our income statement is driven off shipment growth, which is why we said that the wine and spirits business will see profits in the second quarter below the second quarter of last year.", "Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "And why do depletions accelerate?", "Robert P. Ryder", "So again, they just happen in different cadences, right, so depletions will accelerate. Some of it will do what happen with last year's second quarter. But the other will be as we gear up going into October, November, December, right, we expect to have better depletion results in the second quarter.", "Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "And why does depletion get better? Is it just the timing of your marketing?", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes, this is Rob. What really happens is that at the end of the fourth quarter, or I should say the fourth quarter, we had very, very, very strong depletions. That tends to mute depletion growth in the first quarter of this year as the inventory from -- at retail from the fourth quarter moves through. That moves through during the first quarter and, therefore, the second quarter we usually see bounce back to our normal depletion trends of -- at least around mid-single-digit depletion growth. So fourth quarter, we had very high depletion growth, almost double digit. First quarter, we have lower depletion growth, low-single digits. Next quarter, we return to sort of our normal run rate.", "Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Okay. I mean, I suppose, in the second quarter, your depletions could be up 6% and your shipments still up 4%. Right?", "Robert S. Sands", "In the second quarter, you're saying?", "Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Yes.", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes, we're not going to comment on the exact numbers, which, of course, we don't know at this moment.", "Robert P. Ryder", "But remember, from a shipment perspective, right, we said that shipment growth over prior year will drive negative EBIT in the second quarter. So I wouldn't expect shipment growth in the second quarter.", "Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "All right. No shipment growth at all?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Well, again, we're -- let's move on because we're kind of filling out economic models. We're just trying to do a favor giving some hints on second quarter. [indiscernible]", "Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "And can you comment on price mix in the wine business in the first quarter? I think your volume was up 5.4 and your price mix was a negative 1.4, and why would that be since...", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, that's a good question. So again, in the first quarter, we had some anomalies. I'd say price mix in the U.S. business, which usually really drives the bus, was slightly positive, okay? So that -- and if you look at the wine category, the trend continues, generally, the more expensive the wine, the faster it's growing. That was kind of consistent for us. But the anomaly in the first quarter was actually we had some negative price mix outside of the U.S., which it's normally not big enough to have an impact, but this quarter, because the first quarter's our smallest quarter and because it was a bit anomalous in -- mostly it was Canada and New Zealand, it kind of impacted the total business. Again, we don't expect that to be a full year phenomenon, which is a kind of anomalous first quarter event. So most of the negative price mix, actually all the negative price mix was outside of the United States.", "Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "And then my final question is on the beer category in the May quarter. Can you tell us what you think the growth was and when it was on premise as opposed to future consumption?", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes. In the first quarter, the total beer category was down in volume terms about 1%, 1.5% versus our depletions, which, in the first quarter, were up 3%. In general, the trends in on-premise are worse than the trends in off-premise. It's hard to know exactly what the on-premise trends are because they're not tracked. So we don't know exactly what those numbers are, except that we expect that they're probably, as I said, worse in the on-premise than in the off-premise. Now as it relates to the beer business overall, the negative trends were largely driven by the domestic premium segment, which, of course, is dominated by the light premium beers of the 2 major brewers of domestic brands in the United States. The import category generally outperformed the domestic category. We represent about half of the import category, and as I said in my remarks, we gained about 1 point or 100 basis points of share of the import category, and we gained about around 20 basis points or so of the overall beer business in the United States. So generally, those are the trends.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "A couple of questions. On the wine business, you talked about the incremental, I guess, SG&A. I don't know if you're willing to give this, but I mean, how much are we talking that, that part of the wine business should be up in fiscal '14?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, so the numbers that you see in SG&A are a combination of SG&A and marketing, right? And for the full year, we expect marketing to be up as we reinvest in the -- in mostly, the commercial activities, right, and mostly marketing spend. But SG&A would be up as well. The big drivers are normal raises, okay? They're kind of CPI inflation kind of numbers as we come off -- as we fully capitalize our ERP system, we have some increased depreciation around that. And then there's some overlaps from positives we incurred last year that aren't recurring this year that make SG&A looks like it's inflating, but it's really not. It's just overlapping anomalous positives in the previous year. They're the 3 big drivers for the SG&A increase.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "And so would you -- I mean, I don't want to put numbers in your mouth, but would you say, I mean mid-single digits, would that be off base to make that sort of assumption for that part of the business?", "Robert P. Ryder", "No, I mean you can see it in the P&L, right? I think SG&A was up like 7%, 8%, something like that, I think, in the P&L.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "I'm sorry, I was talking for the full year, not for the first quarter, how much it normalizes over the back end of the year?", "Robert P. Ryder", "I would say that the full year will be a little bit less, but pretty much right around where the first quarter was.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "Okay. And then, I guess an unrelated topic, throughout the quarter, we've gotten an announcement on the wine in Brazil and SVEDKA, I think it was, whatever, it was yesterday or last week in South Korea. Can you just talk about sort of the strategy there? Are we likely to see more and more of this in the near future? Is this kind of a much longer build?", "Robert S. Sands", "Well, when you say more of this, what we announced in both cases was the appointment of new distributors. So around the world, whenever we appoint a new distributor for our brand, and these were just changes, so we've distributed in our brands with another distributor prior to this, whenever we appoint a new one, we usually issue a release indicating who our new customer is. So you'll continue to see, as we make adjustments in our distributions matrix, you'll see announcements announcing who our distributors are around the world. So that's really the sole import of all this. Now, as a general proposition, yes, we continue to focus on building our business in regions and countries around the world. We basically distribute every place in the world, largely. And as our brands build momentum, we make adjustments in that distributorship network, and these announcements sort of are fairly reflective of that. Brazil is a fairly bouyant market for imports so, of course, we're relatively optimistic about that business on a small base. So is South Korea, but again, on a very small base.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Torres with HSBC.", "Lauren Torres - HSBC, Research Division", "My question goes back to the Beer business. We've heard a lot over the last couple of years of you gaining share and Modelo portfolio growing faster than the U.S. beer industry. But with that said, during that time period, you've not taken pricing or now, we're seeing some minimal pricing coming through. So just curious to get your thoughts on the ability to take more pricing, are you willing to give up some volume and take that pricing? Or you think the market's just not ready to accept that yet?", "Robert S. Sands", "Well, first of all, Lauren, last year, we took about 2% of pricing, which is, on a percentage basis, lower than the industry, but on a dollar basis, pretty much consistent with what the rest of the industry did, right? Because you remember, our price for our product is substantially higher than the industry, in general. So on nominal terms, the same price increase results in a lower percentage for us versus the rest of the industry. So 2% was pretty healthy. That's point number one. Yes, prior to that, there was a period of time for a few years where we really didn't take much pricing because the focus of the business was largely against making sure that we maintained and, in fact, build market share following the recession of 2008, early 2009. As far as our plans going forward, we expect to continue to monitor what's going on in the industry in general, and we take a very strategic view towards pricing and really look at it on a market-by-market, brand-by-brand basis. And we're going to have to wait and see what happens with the rest of the industry as we move forward, but it looks like, up to now at least, pricing's been pretty healthy in the rest of the industry. So I suppose stay tuned for -- we'll see what happens.", "Lauren Torres - HSBC, Research Division", "Yes. And I guess as a follow-up, and I guess you did address this at your Analyst Day, but now that you're 100% owners of the Beer business, I know this is a very broad question, but any comments you'd like to make as far as things that may be done differently in beer that you may have not been able to do with a partner that you're excited about that could bring a great opportunity over the next couple of years?", "Robert S. Sands", "Sure. Well, probably the biggest area that we're excited about is the opportunities for innovation and new product development. With the ownership of our own production, we can produce new packages and new types that previously we were entirely reliant upon the consent of Modelo to produce. And generally, they didn't really want to do much in the way of innovation, new products, new packages, new types. No less, new brands. So we're doing a lot of thinking about what our NPD and innovation pipeline will be in the future. We already are taking advantage of it. We've intro-ed or we're test marketing, Modelo Especial Lite. We are introducing Modelo Especial Chelada, which is a Bloody Mary style beer, which is actually a pretty large category in the United States. It's dominated entirely by one other supplier, so we see a lot of opportunity there. We are introducing new SKUs in drafts that we haven't previously had. So the primary area where we can really kind of do something different than what we have historically done is in the area of innovation and NPD.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just a question about the wine business. If you look at, I guess, 5 or 6 quarters ago, you made the decision to ramp up or increase your marketing and promotional investment with the aim of holding or gaining market share, which you've been successful at. And I guess when you look at it, where you stand today, are you happy with the return on a net -- on that investment, first? And then now going forward, you feel like you have the right balance between spending on new product innovation, spending on advertising and marketing, and spending on promotion, or will there be any sort of tweaks to that mix going forward?", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes, I think that certainly, right now, we feel like we have the right mix of those items. And yes, we have been successful in driving share. Our goal is not just to drive share. I'll say as a complete and total end goal, it's really about making sure that our brands are healthy so that we can take advantage of trends as they emerge. Now, as we move forward in the future, I am sure, in fact, we will tweak the mix between those things. And of course, in the end, our goal is to drive profitability and margins, but we really have to make sure, first and foremost, that the top line is healthy before we could turn our attention to that. So we'll definitely continue to tweak the mix between those things, and especially as we sort of monitor what's going on in the industry as we move into our next fiscal year and thereafter.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And if I could just follow up, if you look at the industry, the dynamic that's played out over the last year or so is that you've had -- the industry has been pricing at the value end of the category where you don't really participate. But I -- our impression is that helped maybe drive some mix benefit, drive consumers into the next price tiers. Just based on what you're seeing today, has anything changed in that dynamic? Is there still firm pricing at the value end of the category? And would you expect that to continue?", "Robert S. Sands", "Not much has changed. The pricing is almost all at the low end, but that's not the surprising because the low end is the least fragmented part of the category, dominated largely by 2 suppliers. It has very much impacted the volume growth in the low end, so the pricing was not without some impact on volume, actually, fairly significant. It has driven some trade up. We are seeing more pricing, I suppose, at the top end sort of above $15, $20 as wine supplies, especially in the above $20 category, which is largely the North Coast Sonoma/Napa wine supplies have been very tight up there. So there has been some pricing there. The, I'll say, more commercial part of the business between $5 and $15 is much more fragmented, so we tend not to see pricing occur in that category or in that -- those segments as quickly as it occurs in the other 2 segments, but I would say, over time, we probably expect to see some pricing start hitting in those categories. And we have seen it in some specific brands. We've seen some pricing being taken, and some specific suppliers have taken some pricing in that category. But I would say not overall as a general proposition.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan.", "John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just a quick question here. You talked about the on-premise being a little bit weaker for the Beer business, and one of the things you're focusing on with Corona Light is more of a draft presence than getting tap handles. So does this change and do we need to see the on-premise reaccelerate before we see the payoff on this? Or is this something where you think you've got enough momentum behind the brand that even if on-premise remains a little bit weak, you can still drive some decent growth off of that?", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes, we are -- in our business, draft is a very, very, very small percentage of our business, about 2%, yes. Well, for us, it's even less -- I'm sorry, it's even less than 2%. But for the industry overall, it's a much higher percentage, so we under index grossly when it comes to draft. So regardless basically of what happens on the on-premise as an overall proposition, because we're so under indexed, it's a big opportunity for us. Now, that said, the strategy on draft is really all about providing the opportunity on, on premise for sampling of our products, and -- which translates directly into off premise volume and sales growth. So I don't think that the opportunity there has much to do with what's going on in the on-premise in general at all. It's all about we have traditionally just simply not participated in this segment. So the growth opportunity is quite substantial for us even without the on-premise generally growing.", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, John. The on-premise, as Rob said, is not growing. We feel we are growing in the on premise in our Beer business, right? As Rob said, the numbers aren't really like incredibly nuclear, but we feel we're growing pretty well in draft. Draft is helping it, and actually, we have some tests that said when draft is on the account and people can see the tap handle, they'll actually also buy the bottle brand as well, right? So it's kind of synergistic in that way.", "John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then one sort of quick follow-up here. You talked about the wine EBIT being below last year. Shipments below depletions, is the margins -- should we expect the margins to be down sort of a similar amount in Q2 versus Q1 roughly similar from that standpoint?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, so we would expect margin erosion again in the second quarter because remember, I said that our profit growth is back-end weighted, right? So I don't think we'll see the -- for the full year, our guidance is for margin erosion in the wine and spirits business because we have operating profit growth estimated below net sales growth. But I think you're seeing an anomalously negative margin in the front half, which will start to come back in the second half of the year.", "John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. So -- but Q2 probably somewhat similar to Q1 though?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Probably.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein with ISI.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Guys, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on what you think is driving incredibly strong beer performance. I mean last year, everything went right. I mean the weather was amazing, I mean you've -- the timing of the holidays was great. You had incredibly difficult comps. This year, the weather couldn't have been worse. I mean as you tread objectively, kind of look back in terms of what you're doing right in the marketplace on an execution side and marketing side, can you give us any sense of what you think is driving these incredibly impressive results on the beer side?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, Robert. Thank you for that complement. I hope everybody heard that. I hope our Beer business guys heard that. But look, if you talk brands, right, the current juggernaut is Modelo Especial. And it continues -- it's above 40 million cases, which is a substantial brand, and it continues to grow on the 20% range. So I think that's the big buy brand section. I think the other thing that's happening is the import category's doing better than premiums or the sub-premiums, that's helping. And I think our marketing continues to resonate with the consumer, and the strong equity continues to resonate with the consumer. And very good sales execution. So I'd say not any one thing. One brand is clear, it is Modelo Especial. And then it's good execution around everything else.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Terrific. And Bob, as you continue to have more conversations with your leading retail customers about the new shape of your portfolio and kind of the increased importance of your portfolio at a lot of the retailers, can you give us any sense of how those discussions are going, whether you think you now have, obviously, a bigger seat at the table, you'll have more shelf space possibly going forward? Any color around that?", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes, Robert. We definitely have a bigger seat at the table. As I've commented before, total beverage alcohol is probably the most important category at retail, especially in the chain and mass merchandisers environment. And as one of the largest multi-category players or the largest multi-category player and third largest category player overall, that puts us on a very important position. So our conversations with these retailers are good, and we hope to translate our position into a better position in these retailers. So that's something that we're always working on and yes, we're making progress. We have increased points of distribution in both wine, spirits and beer. So we think that we should be seeing continued favorable trends as a result of this.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Terrific. And then just one last question. Can you give us an update on where you see kind of currency potentially affecting results this year? And are you doing any hedging of any of your peso-based costs? How should we be thinking about that in the second half of the year?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, so we do, do hedging. We hedge currencies and we hedge fuel prices, are currently what we're hedging. We do not yet hedge the peso because we don't have enough data from the new business to enter into those contracts. We are looking at it, and I would expect us to start hedging the peso as we go forward. The dollar's strengthened versus the peso, but it's been very volatile. And so we're keeping our eye on it. Right now, it looks better than it did a month ago, but again, it's very volatile. Of course, the euro and dollar is very volatile as well, that's our other big exposure. And we're also hedging fuel prices, which actually, for us, and it's all around freight, is a bigger number than our exposure to currencies, okay? So I think that's what we look at going forward.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Sure. And just, I mean, so I just want to make sure I get this right. So any decrease in the peso is going to lower your cost, so that would be a benefit. Am I right about that?", "Robert P. Ryder", "That's correct, yes. Because we...", "Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And can you give us like, I don't know, for a 10% decrease roughly on an annualized basis, what that could mean?", "Robert P. Ryder", "No, it would -- I'm not going to give those numbers because, frankly, we're still investigating. But actually, we're not as exposed to the peso as you might think, mostly because if you go back through the myriad of contracts that we have, where the beer that we do not make, we're buying in dollars from InBev, right? So that's a big thing. Natural gas is generally priced in dollars. Natural gas fuels the plants. In addition, most of the global beer input costs, malt, barley, things like that, are also paid for in dollars. It's kind of like oil. So really, the big exposure we have in pesos is the cash cost at the facility, which is mostly labor costs, right? That's our exposure, which isn't as big as you would think it would be because remember how automated this facility is. So yes, we have peso exposure. It's not as big as you might think.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just as a follow-up on the question that we had at the Investor Day on the packaging side, and you had mentioned that there was a new packaging bottling plant that was being built in Piedras Negras, how far along is that plant in terms of -- is that plant actually in operation now? And if not, when do you think it will be operational? My understanding is, I guess, if ABI was to sell, that you have right of first refusal. Can give us any color around that situation?", "Robert P. Ryder", "We -- that's InBev's plant, so we don't have any insights to it. But we currently aren't sourcing any glass from that, and that's really not on our radar screen right now.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. But it is in operation now?", "Robert S. Sands", "No. To my knowledge, it is not in operation currently.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tom Mullarkey with Morningstar.", "Thomas Mullarkey - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "I have a follow-up on John's question concerning draft beer. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned the rollouts in a few select markets. Are there currently supply-chain bottlenecks or strategic reasons why you don't want to do a more broad scale rollout of tap handles across America? And how do you foresee the mix of draft beer for you changing over the next 3 to 5 years? Will it be a steady creep-up or will it be a kind of a stair-step change once the bulk of the brewery expansion is done?", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes, no, there's not -- there's really no, I would say, overall supply chain issues other than just getting the supply chain for draft beer on a large scale up and going, is a relatively complicated process because it involves producing a lot more or having a lot more kegs than you need. It involves having the infrastructure in place for delivering kegs and having kegs returned and so on and so forth. So there's no issue, and we will continue to build the business. I would say it's going to be, as opposed to like a gigantic step change, I think it will be a slower change as we continue to build the business from where we are currently, which is about 2 million cases out of 170 million. So I said 2% is actually closer to 1% to more of the industry average, which is around 10%. So it will be a slow build. Obviously, that's a lot of draft beer as we build towards those numbers. But our intention is to continue to build the business, and we are putting the infrastructure in place. And as we continue to -- as we build out the Piedras Negras brewery, we'll be doing so, making sure that we have that capacity in mind.", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, so just to follow up on Rob, our draft business is doubling, still small but doubling. This is logistically complex, but also, remember, we're trying to be very selective with the accounts that we go into. So we're at a higher end, mostly on our draft, right? So we might not get the full distribution that maybe a Bud Light or Coors Light will because we'll be a little bit more selective. But we're very happy with the progress so far, and I think it's a slow build, but I'll take a slow build if it's a doubling of the business every year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel.", "Jesse Reinherz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "This is Jesse Reinherz in for Mark. So a question on the SG&A spend. Sounds like we're going to see more of an uptick in marketing in 2Q than we saw in Q1. And then that's going to kind of level out in 3 or 4Q, you're going to be a little bit less than we saw in Q2. Is that correct?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, we're just trying to give you a hint towards Q2, so we're -- I'm not going to get into like quarterly guidance stuff on marketing spend. But marketing spend in Q1 was below prior year, and for the full year, it's going to be above prior year. Yes, so you'd expect balance of the year to be higher.", "Jesse Reinherz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just on the decision to kind of take up marketing in second quarter, and I guess, beyond. Is this more of a proactive move or is this a symptom of you guys seeing increasing competition in wine and kind of trying to get behind that?", "Robert P. Ryder", "No, it's nothing. I'd say in beer, it's maybe more conscious to move some marketing spend into the second quarter. It's probably a little bit of a bigger bet on baseball and probably driving some of our Hispanic marketing. And in wine, it's more just I don't think we're that anomalous from prior years, we're just increasing total marketing spending in wine. It just so happened that Q1 was a little bit lighter and that the balance of the year will be heavier than prior year.", "Operator", "And your final question comes from the line of Carla Casella with JPMorgan.", "Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just one quick finance question. You mentioned you put the revolver in place to fund the acquisition. Can you just say how much you drew on it in the second quarter?", "Robert P. Ryder", "No, I'm not going to give second quarter balance sheet stuff, right? So we did draw on it to fund the acquisition, which happened like 7 days into the quarter.", "Operator", "That was our final question. I'd now like to turn the floor back over to Rob Sands for any closing remarks.", "Robert S. Sands", "Okay. Well, thanks for joining our call today. We are very excited about the final completion of the beer deal. We have great marketplace momentum across beer, wine and spirits, and we're on track to meet all our goals for the year. I hope you've had the opportunity to enjoy some of our fine products, especially the SVEDKA Stars and Stripes during the 4th of July holiday later this week. So thanks, again, for your participation.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Patty Yahn-Urlaub", "Thank you, Laurie. Good morning, everyone. Happy New Year. Welcome to Constellation's Third Quarter Fiscal 2014 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer.", "This call complements our news release which has also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable, organic and constant-currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com.", "Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call.

For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company's estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings.", "And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.", "Robert S. Sands", "Thanks, Patty, and good morning and happy New Year to everyone. I hope everybody enjoyed the holidays and had an opportunity to drink some of our Constellation products this holiday season.", "Welcome to our discussion of Constellation's third quarter fiscal 2014 sales and earnings results. Before we get started with the review of the quarter, I believe it's worth noting that for a second consecutive year, Constellation stock was the best performer in the S&P 500 Consumer Staples universe, as well as one of the top performing stocks within the overall S&P 500 index, increasing almost 100% for calendar year 2013.", "We believe that the realization of significant benefits from the beer business acquisition, along with excellent execution within Crown's U.S. commercial business, are the key driver of this stock price appreciation. In addition, we have successfully completed the transition of our new brewery in Nava, Mexico. Beer operations are running smoothly, the supply chain is operating efficiently, and all key performance metrics are being achieved at the brewery. As you know, we are in the initial phase of the brewery expansion project which will include the buildout of the brewhouse, packaging, warehousing and site infrastructure.", "Although we are in the early stages of this process, I am pleased to report that all design work for the brewery and the packaging area has been completed, and we are currently finalizing warehouse expansion details. In addition, stainless steel is being fabricated for the beer tanks, and we have begun grading of the site in preparation for the building construction.", "From a commercial beer business perspective in the U.S., Crown had a phenomenal quarter, generating sales growth of 21% while continuing to gain market share. All 4 Mexican brands posted notable depletion growth during the quarter, with their 2 most significant brands, Modelo Especial increasing 18% and Corona Extra growing almost 6%.", "Depletions for the draft beer business increased more than 30%, and after repositioning Victoria in key markets and expanding into select new markets, this brand has regained momentum, posting depletion growth of greater than 20%. Overall, excellent sales and depletion results for Crown were driven by a number of factors, including continuing strong consumer demand for our outstanding portfolio of brands; an increase in third quarter shipments to replenish distributor inventory levels which were running below normal after this year's robust summer selling season; an easier comparison versus last year's third quarter due to the timing of shipments in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 in advance of price increases in select markets; and excellent execution by Crown wholesalers who now have the assurance that Constellation will be their long-term business partner since the closing of the beer deal.", "The renewed momentum we experienced during the summer selling season, particularly for the Corona brand, continued throughout the fall and into the holiday selling season. We believe this strong consumer demand was driven by the combined success of a number of marketing initiatives, including execution of the new TV advertising, including the Some Beaches campaign, Jon Gruden TV ads featured during Monday Night Football games, and new Spanish-language creative which was aired on TV during Mexican national team soccer matches and other key programs on Spanish-language networks.", "Corona also sponsored the Mayweather versus Canelo boxing fight, supported by TV advertising and limited edition 18-pack wrapped bottles which resulted in strong execution in Hispanic accounts. Corona Extra has now become the fifth-largest dollar-share brand in IRI channels, and continues to grow and gain share. The strong momentum of Modelo Especial also continued throughout the quarter. New SKU and innovation including Modelo Especial Chelada are driving consumer trade-up within the overall portfolio and bringing new customers into the franchise.", "New Spanish-language TV advertising was recently introduced to support the newly released Modelo Especial Chelada, which has significantly exceeded volume and distribution targets in its launch markets. Modelo Especial draft, Crown's second-largest draft brand after Pacifico, grew 30% -- 35% during the quarter.", "Overall, the strong results that Crown has achieved this year are the primary driver of the upward revision to Constellation's overall EPS guidance for fiscal 2014. As such, we are also revising our fiscal 2014 forecast for the Crown business and now expect beer depletions to increase mid single-digits, which will drive sales growth in the high single-digit range with operating profits expected to increase in the low- to mid-teen range.", "And now, I'd like to focus on the operational results for our wine and spirits business. As we noted earlier this year, the performance of our wine and spirits business would be skewed towards the second half of the year to align with peak -- the peak seasonality of the business as well as new product introductions. I'm very encouraged by the acceleration of depletion trends during the third quarter and the fact that on a year-to-date basis, we are outperforming the U.S. wine market on a volume basis across all channels. These results were driven by some of our key Focus Brands that continue to achieve noteworthy accomplishments, a few of which I will highlight.", "The 2011 Robert Mondavi Oakville Fum\u00e9 Blanc was recently awarded a 95-point score in the Top 100 Wine for 2013 from Wine Enthusiast. The 2010 Robert Mondavi Cabernet Reserve received 95 points from Robert Parker of the Wine Advocate, who also liked the Franciscan 2010 Magnificat, which was awarded a 91-point score. Wine.com, the nation's #1 among retail, recently released its top 100 list based entirely on consumer preferences. Some of the great Constellation Brands that made the list include Robert Mondavi Napa Cabernet, Ruffino Modus, Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc and Franciscan Cabernet Sauvignon. Impact recently presented Blue Chip Awards for Estancia, Robert Mondavi Private Selection, SVEDKA, Ruffino and Kim Crawford. And Constellation received 37 medals across all brands submitted to the 2013 World Value Wine Challenge, the nation's most comprehensive competition of wines priced at less than $20. Gold medals, 90-plus point scores and best buy distinctions were awarded to Robert Mondavi Private Selection, as well as Rex Goliath.", "Overall, third quarter segment net sales for wine increased 3% driven by the U.S. wine portfolio, with depletion trends for the entire portfolio growing more than 4%. Third quarter spirits sales declined 5% and can be primarily attributed to an unfavorable comparison versus last year when we had the benefit of the bulk bourbon sales. However, we experienced improving spirits depletion trends in the third quarter, as some of our investments took hold for this business. As a matter of fact, from a consumer takeaway perspective across all channels during the third quarter, Constellation's overall spirit growth of more than 5% exceeded the category growth of about 1.5%.", "SVEDKA depletions grew in the high single-digit range during the third quarter, while gaining almost 2 points of volume share of the imported vodka category in IRI channels. We are currently preparing to introduce the next 2 new SVEDKA flavors, strawberry lemonade and mango pineapple, which are expected to launch during the first quarter. The new Black Velvet Cinnamon Rush, which launched early in the third quarter, is performing well and is one of our top-performing new SKUs from a distribution perspective.", "Since the closing of the beer deal, we have also begun to leverage our sales and marketing efforts across our beer, wine and spirits business. For instance, SVEDKA and Corona joined forces for a national, on-premise program showcasing the SVEDKA Coronation Cocktail. This delicious proprietary beer cocktail harnesses the popularity of these 2 key brands and leverages the joint on-premise efforts of our organization. Corona Extra and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi, recently partnered with Butterball, in a major cross-portfolio program that leveraged the power of the 2 strongest brands in our portfolio. This fully integrated holiday promotion began in advance of Thanksgiving, reaching consumers through displays, point-of-sale materials and a unique Turkey Talk-Line, where consumers received recipes and pairing tests.", "Now despite this quarter's improving depletion results for wine and spirits, we will be unable to attain our original fiscal 2014 operating profit goal for this business due to the following factors: the positive mix trends that we anticipated earlier this year have not reached targeted levels as our premium-priced products are growing faster than our super and ultra premium-priced products; and we have invested more than originally anticipated in promotional activity as the key to $5 to $15 price point at retail remains competitive.", "While we are disappointed that the wine and spirits business will not achieve its expected profitability goals, the hard work and significant accomplishments we have made throughout the last few years have favorably positioned this business heading into next year. Overall, our wine and spirits strategy has been to focus on brand-building and maintaining market share to ensure that our business remains strong and healthy. Strong competition for some of our key brands has necessitated higher promotional spend to meet this objective. We expect this strategy to reap rewards in the future when market dynamics begin to enable lower levels of promotional activity or more favorable pricing environment, as our brands will be in a great position to capitalize on these trends.", "Meanwhile, our focus on new product development and innovation, as well as channel development and execution to continue to contribute to our future growth while we remain committed to brand-building in our core business, we believe these initiatives will drive enhanced mixed results while we also expect to begin to realize benefits from abating grape costs.", "Collectively, these actions are expected to drive EBIT growth of the wine and spirits business in the future. In closing, as a true triple threat in beer, wine and spirits, we have ushered in an exciting new era of growth and opportunity. We are progressing with the brewery expansion in Mexico while maintaining the strong momentum of Crown's U.S. commercial business. We have a great premium wine business and plans in place to work through the current set of challenges we are facing.", "I am especially gratified by the fact that Constellation was the best performing S&P 500 Consumer Staples stock in calendar 2013 for the consecutive year in a row.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our third quarter results.", "Robert P. Ryder", "Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Our comparable basis diluted EPS for Q3 came in at $1.10. This represents a sizable increase versus Q3 last year as we continue to realize the tremendous accretion attributable to the beer business acquisition, which is significantly enhancing our sales, operating profit, operating margin and free cash flow. Our Q3 results also benefited from a lower-than-anticipated tax rate, driven by higher-than-expected foreign tax credits.", "The strong marketplace momentum we experienced over the summer for our beer business continued into the fall timeframe. Business helped to drive year-to-date financial performance ahead of our expectations and is the primary driver for the upward revision to our fiscal 2014 EPS guidance. Favorability in our tax rate and interest expense expectations are also contributing to our improved EPS guidance.", "The positive guidance factors that I just noted are being somewhat offset by our wine and spirits business. Our fiscal 2014 financial performance is expected to come in below our original expectations, as Rob just noted. We'll look closer at the guidance highlights just mentioned as we review Q3 performance in more detail. My comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results.", "As you can see from our news release, consolidated net sales in Q3 included $662 million of incremental net sales related to the beer business acquisition as we consolidated 100% of beer sales for Q3. For Q3, beer segment net sales increased 21%, primarily due to volume growth as highlighted by Rob. These results are somewhat enhanced by an easier-than-normal sales comparison versus Q3 last year when net sales increased 1%. Depletions were strong at 10% growth for the quarter. Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant-currency basis increased 3%. This reflects a 4% increase in branded wine and spirits shipment volume, partially offset by higher promotion expense and lower bulk spirits sales.", "For the quarter, consolidated gross profit increased $298 million. As you know, under the Crown joint venture structure, we recognize our share of Crown's earnings on the equity earnings line. Since the close of the beer transaction on June 7, 100% of Crown's results, along with the Mexican beer production profit stream, are consolidated by Constellation. Incremental gross profit from the consolidation of beer was $301 million in Q3. This produced a beer segment gross margin of 45% for the quarter based on the incremental beer sales discussed earlier.", "For the quarter, our consolidated gross margin was 42.4% versus 41% for the prior year quarter. The benefit from the consolidation of the beer business was partially offset by lower gross margin in wine and spirits, which resulted from increased product costs and higher promotional spending.", "SG&A for the quarter increased $96 million. The incremental SG&A associated with consolidating the beer business was $88 million. Essentially all of the SG&A for the beer business is related to Crown, as the brewery had very little costs classified as SG&A. Based on what I just outlined, operating income generated by the beer business was $213 million for the quarter. This produced a beer segment operating margin of approximately 32%. Since the close of the acquisition on June 7, the consolidation of the beer business results has produced a beer operating margin of approximately 30%.", "The inclusion of the beer business results was the primary driver behind the 350 basis-point improvement in our consolidated operating margin for the quarter. Due to the timing of the close of the beer acquisition, we did not recognize any equity earnings for Crown during the third quarter. For the prior year third quarter, equity earnings for Crown was $39 million. Equity earnings for the wine and spirits segment increased $4 million in Q3 of this year due to strong results for Opus One.", "Interest expense for the quarter was $90 million, up 46% versus last year. The increase reflects higher average borrowings as a result of the acquisition, partially offset by lower average interest rate. We now expect interest expense for the year to approximate $325 million, which puts us at the low end of our previous $325 million to $335 million guidance range.", "Timing of our cash flow generation and benefit from our lower cost securitization facilities helped drive this improvement. That provides a good spot to discuss our debt position.", "At the end of November, our total debt was $7.1 billion. This represents a $3.8 billion increase of our debt level at the end of fiscal '13. The increase primarily reflects the financing for the beer business acquisition, partially offset by some of our cash build in advance of the transaction and our free cash flow generation. During the third quarter, our debt balance decreased by $166 million. I would also like to note that the calculation of the post-closing purchase price adjustment payment for the beer transaction has been finalized, and we expect to make a payment of $558 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2015.", "In connection with this, the calendar 2012 EBITDA related to the acquired manufacturing and brand-owner profits came in a little above the $370 million we had originally estimated. Our Q3 comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 28%, which reflected benefits from integrating the beer business as well as higher-than-anticipated foreign tax credits. Given the additional foreign tax credits, we now expect the comparable basis effective tax rate to approximate 31% for fiscal 2014 versus our previous 32% guidance. Longer term, we continue to target a 32% effective tax rate as the brewery gets built out over the next 3 years.", "Now let's discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the first 9 months of fiscal '14, we generated $543 million of free cash flow versus $337 million for the same quarter last year -- the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to benefits from the beer business acquisition, partially offset by higher interest payments. We're pleased with the strong year-to-date free cash flow results, but we expect brewery capital expansion investments to significantly increase in the fourth quarter. We have updated our free cash flow guidance to reflect the improvement in our projected beer business results and now expect to generate free cash flow in the range of $525 million to $575 million. This puts us at the higher end of our previous guidance range.", "Now let's move to our full year fiscal 2014 P&L outlook. We're now forecasting comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $3.10 to $3.20 a share, versus our previous guidance of $2.80 to $3.10 a share. Strong beer business performance is driving the upward revision to our fiscal 2014 guidance. For fiscal '14, Crown is now targeting net sales growth in the high single-digits, generally in line with what Crown has experienced on a year-to-date basis. We now expect underlying operating for Crown, which is before any beer manufacturing and brand-owner profit, to be in the low- to mid-teen range. Our brewery and brand-owner profits are also expected to exceed original expectations. Higher production volumes, favorable peso to dollar exchange rates and lower-than-anticipated SG&A build are driving this favorability.", "As mentioned earlier, wine and spirits performance has tracked below our original targets. We now expect wine and spirits organic revenue growth to be in the low to mid single-digit range. The decrease versus our original mid single-digit target is being primarily driven by higher-than-planned promotional spending and lower-than-expected sales mix benefits. These factors are also driving a reduction in our wine and spirits operating income expectations. We now expect wine and spirits operating income to be flat to down slightly from the fiscal 2014 results. This is versus our original low to mid single-digit growth projection.", "The EPS guidance improvement also includes tax rate and interest rate favorability that I highlighted earlier. Our comparable basis guidance excludes restructuring charges and unusual items, which are detailed on the last page of the press release.", "Before we take your questions, I would like to emphasize how pleased we are with the transformational beer business acquisition. Our results continue to demonstrate how this transaction enhances our financial profile, as it significantly increases sales, operating profit, operating margin and free cash flow. Our beer supply chain has been operating efficiently and Crown's execution and momentum in the marketplace has been outstanding, driving the upward revision in our EPS goal and positioning us well as we head towards the completion of a phenomenal year for Constellation.", "With that, we're happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Davidson.", "Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Let's see, the wine business did underperform a bit, but you made some comments that are sort of were in line with my bigger-picture thinking, which is that promotional spending will go down and pricing will go up in relationship to the tighter overall supply. The '13 crop was big, but longer term, I think that that thesis is correct. Can you comment at all on that?", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes, I would say that we agree with that thesis. It depends, of course, what segments that you're talking about historically, or at least in the last 12 months. We have seen sort of the $5 to $15 segment be fairly competitive, which in our view, necessitated some additional investment in promo this year because our principal goal and strategy is really all about brand-building and making sure that we keep our portfolio healthy, precisely so that we can take advantage of the kind of trends that you were talking about. So we feel pretty good about that thesis, and layered on to our strategy is a pretty robust new product development process of initiatives also designed to continue to enhance our mix and our margins and ROIC as well. So we think that's sort of the combination of the expectation of an improving environment, combined with NPD intended to, as I said, drive mix and margins, is a pretty good formula for success in the future.", "Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "And if I could just follow up, one on the beer side, I think you said Corona's depletions were like 6%. Would that be indicative of kind of the pre-innovation number in the beer business? Should we kind of be thinking that baseline business was up 5 or 6, and innovation drove it higher to the 10-ish level?", "Robert S. Sands", "Well, I wouldn't really call that baseline performance per se. We've been inclusive of the NPD. I mean, that is very, very strong performance. We probably say that for the longer term, it's fair to count on or to expect more like mid single-digit growth in total over the longer run. But clearly, we're significantly outperforming that due to very strong consumer takeaways. So it is a little hard to predict right now.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alice Longley of Buckingham Research.", "Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "I have a little housekeeping question and then another one. In terms of your beer shipments, you had 4% price mix. I'm wondering if it's reasonable to think that at the level of shipping to the retailers, there was also 4% price mix on top of the 10% volume growth for beer? And then, can you take apart the 4%? How much of it was price and how much mix?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, Alice, what I would say is there might have been some anomalies year-over-year in the quarter, but our price mix in beer is consistent with what we've been talking about all year, and that's probably right around 2%, is where we'll kind of end up at the end of the year, similar to last year's.", "Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Okay. That's helpful. And that was all price, right, because mix is maybe even a little negative?", "Robert P. Ryder", "It was mostly price, yes.", "Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Yes, and then my other question is a longer one. Your -- the only guidance you've given for where beer margins ultimately could go is, I think you said the low- to the mid-30s by fiscal '17. That's starting to look a little conservative. Can you comment on that? Where you think beer margins ultimately can go for you now that you know more about the business?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, so again, this quarter, it was a fantastic quarter, so I'd be careful extrapolating that into the future. But we, right now, have no reason to change that beer operating or gross profit margin guidance. And remember, we're still new to the manufacturing of this, and as we build out the brewery and double the capacity, there's still some unknowns on what would happen. We were fortunate this year also that the peso-dollar exchange rate turned out to be much better than it was when we originally set guidance. So we're still sticking with that beer operating profit margin guidance. And as we learn more, because remember, a big piece of our finished goods is now produced by ourselves and we have less than perfect visibility into the cost structures of those when we take that over. So there's still a bit of grayness in there. So we're sticking with that guidance.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust.", "Sarah Miller - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "This is Sarah Miller, on for Bill. One of our questions is on -- do you have any visibility into what your timing of marketing is going to be, I guess for the -- over the balance of the next year for the beer business?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Did you say -- well, I mean this year, I think we made a concerted effort to really take advantage of the peak summer sale seasons. And we kind of moved some of our marketing activities to that period of time. I think we're very happy with that result. So -- and actually at this time of year is when we're really kind of nailing down next year's plan, so it's not completely formulated yet. But I think we're pretty happy with this year's result, so there could be good probability that we replicate this year's timing of marketing spend.", "Sarah Miller - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then second question on -- can you talk about kind of the status of the draft opportunity at this point? I know you mentioned that Modelo draft was up 35% in the quarter. Where is Corona Light, and kind of where are you seeing that success there?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, so total -- we're very happy with our draft business. And in addition, as we get into new accounts with draft, we do see some evidence that helps our case sales as well. It's a very good marketing point to have those tap handles in front of the consumers as they are enjoying our products on-premise. But this year, total draft is growing", "about 30%, and actually, our largest draft product is Pacifico, but I think we're expecting great things from Corona Light draft, which we were in test market last year and we're rolling that out nationally as we go forward. So we probably expect Corona Light to be our biggest draft brand, followed by Pacifico, and then I think Modelo Especial is closely behind that. But we see great things for our draft business.", "Sarah Miller - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "And Corona Light starts to rollout now or next month? Or...", "Robert P. Ryder", "It's rolling out as we speak.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Two questions. One on beer and then over on to wine and spirits. On the beer side, kind of following on the last question, can you give us a little more color on what in your opinion is really driving this improvement in the Corona trend, the acceleration there? And similarly, what's driving the accelerating trends for Especial?", "Robert S. Sands", "I think on -- there's a number of things going on here at a number of different levels. First of all, it's a little bit of success brings more success, especially with our wholesale customers who now I would say have the assurance that they're going to continue to retain these brands as they're going to be partnered with Constellation. As you can well imagine, the rest of the beer business, which constitutes very large portions of their business, is pretty lackluster and down. So -- and our wholesalers are really looking at our business as being the only material business that they have, which is really driving growth and profitability for them for the future. So I would say that they've really gotten behind it in a big way, which from a push perspective, is really driving the continued expansion of the brands at retail. And with the consumer, I'd say number two, our marketing of these brands has been very strong. Our investment behind these brands has been strong. And really, we're seeing sort of better brand health for these brands than we've ever seen in their history. And I think that that's translating to improved and better consumer takeaway. And something that I said in the past that I think differentiates us from a lot of the competition in beer is that we've had a very consistent message to the consumer about what these products stand for, year in and year out, that has resonated with the consumer. And I think that, as I said, that's a differentiating factor versus the competition, which has kind of been all over the place trying to find some hook with the consumer in a market that's been down overall. So look, the better beer market is the place to be. We're the largest player in the better beer market. The consumer is definitely also trading up in beer to more premium products, and we're reaping the rewards of all of these trends as well as our own good marketing and sales execution, and as well as having a very strong distribution network behind our brands in a way like they probably have never gotten behind any brands in the past.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "That's great. And if I could, on that topic, before we go over to wine and spirits, when you look at Especial specifically, can you speak to how the brand is doing when you factor out the ACV gains you're getting?", "Robert S. Sands", "Well, we think that -- look, we don't have those -- those numbers are very hard to really ascertain across the whole business. But to put it very simply, I believe we've got 2 things going for us, which is number one, gains in ACV which are driving growth in the brand, as well as gains in velocity per point of distribution. So put in simple terms, I think that we've got growing same-store sales as well as growing distribution. So you basically are hitting on all cylinders as far as that goes.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Got it. Great. And then over on wine and spirits, this promotional need-more-money has been going on for a number of years. How are you thinking about the earnings algorithm for that business that you put out there back in June? Do you still feel good about that? Is it kind of a work in process? Can you speak to how you're thinking about that algorithm? I appreciate the comments on inputs coming down, but when you net it all together, how are you thinking about that?", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes, I'd say that we feel very good about the algorithm and we stick by it. I'd say that we're disappointed, we don't feel good about the fact that we're probably a bit behind in achieving the algorithm. But I think as a general proposition, we feel probably more confident than ever as we go into next year and the year after, that we will be able to grow the process in this business. So look, we've been making some calculated decisions to invest behind this business and focus on brand-building and brand health, so that the business stays fundamentally healthy. I think that as far as the wine business goes, we've got the best and healthiest wine business in the industry. I think fundamentally, the category is a great category, growing faster than almost any other consumer staple category, taking share from the other categories. We know that, that is offset to some degree by some negatives around fragmentation and lack of brand loyalty in the same sense that it exists in certain spirits segments and beer segments, but nevertheless, it's an extremely strong consumer segment that has backing of the retailers. We're the major player in premium wines. And I think that Tim Ramey expressed what we believe is going to be the trends for the future. So I think we're going to be able to translate our strong position in wine, not only into sales and market share growth, but into profit growth as well. So we feel good about it.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "So the final thing here and I appreciate -- I apologize, I'm taking so much time here, but a bit of a disconnect here with this year being flat to down slightly. Next year, you're basically saying you get back in terms of profit growth in wine and spirits. That's a function of inputs improving -- like if you had to put something at the top of the list, why are we supposed to think that that business, from a profit growth perspective, is going to get better?", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes, so I'll give you a few simple answers to that, which is this business continues to grow nicely, number one. We probably don't see the need for increasing promotional activity in the future and input costs, which were significantly higher this year, will not be significantly higher next year. So the conditions are pretty good for profit growth.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of ISI Group.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Can you remind -- a couple of questions, can you remind us what percentage of your beer sales are draft right now?", "Robert P. Ryder", "It may be 2%.", "Robert S. Sands", "It's a very low 2% or 3%, whereas the industry overall is at 10%.", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes.", "Robert S. Sands", "So it's pretty small.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Right. And what exactly -- I mean, there's a huge competition, right, for new taps for -- on the handles of -- with craft and everybody else. What is actually is your strategy in terms of -- what do you have to do to get people to change out?", "Robert S. Sands", "Well, I think the great thing is that historically, there's been very pent-up demand for taps from our portfolio because we've had no draft, and our on-premise retailers have been calling and begging and asking for draft for many years. We didn't have it historically because it was the strategy of the owner of the brand, Modelo, prior to our acquisition of them, to not have draft in the United States. We didn't think that, that was a great position and we disagreed with it, but fundamentally, we didn't have any choice there. So as soon as we gained control of the brand, we've introduced draft, I think it's turned out to be a very good choice and has been completely additive to the business as opposed to cannibalistic, especially given the brands that we focused on for draft. So we don't have any trouble getting draft handles in the on-premise. So it doesn't take much of a strategy, given that it's a called-for item in most cases as opposed to a push-on. Think about the craft business, okay? You're talking about tiny little brands that nobody's ever heard of outside of their city and, in most cases, so yes, that requires a strategy to get people to put taps in on brands that nobody's ever heard of in a crowded and fragmented category. In our particular case, you're talking about the largest import brands that haven't had draft and now have draft that have a lot of consumer acceptance, which in fact, is actually building and growing, and therefore, our retailers are calling and asking for the taps.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Now look, that makes a huge amount of sense. Is there any reason to think that draft can't get to 10% of your business over time?", "Robert S. Sands", "I would say that there's no reason to think that draft can't get to 10% of our business over time.", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, the only pause for that is the Corona Extra strategy, which is very unique in the beer marketplace because it's so well-developed and the bottle is so much of the brand equity. So we'll go slowly on that. But other than that, it's go for everything we can get.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Terrific. Moving to the wine business, is there -- can you give us a sense of how the innovations are being received in the marketplace? And how -- and whether it's given the tremendous proliferation of SKUs in all of the categories, beer, wine and spirits, is it more difficult today to get new products out on the shelves than it was a few years ago?", "Robert S. Sands", "Well, first of all, to the first part of your question, NPD is an interesting and tricky business and you don't expect to have 100% success, and NPD is sort of the nature of the animal. You have to have a good pipeline of it to get the occasional successes. And I'd say that true to that, we've got some really good successes. I think that if I was to say what I think is our #1 success right now, it's our brand, The Dreaming Tree, which is our joint venture with Dave Matthews, which we think is going to be a blockbuster brand in a very mix-accretive segment. We've got other NPD which I think is very solid, like our brand, Simply Naked, for instance in the super premium category. We've introduced some new products of late where we're seeing some very positive signs, a product called Besieged, which is a Sonoma product from our Ravenswood winery, which we actually saw a lot of success with. We've got a new product called SAVED, which we're very hopeful for. We've got an on-premise product called Hidden Crush. We introduced a new brand targeted towards millennials in the super premium category called Milestone, which we're seeing some early signs of success. So it's a little early to call. We've had some really good successes. I think, as I said, like Dreaming Tree is our #1 success. And then we've got a lot that we are in the process of developing at the current time and are -- I would say, have seen some early signs and are hopeful that we'll have some good successes in our pipeline.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And is it -- but is it more difficult now to get the shelf space than it was in the past?", "Robert S. Sands", "I think it depends who you are. So as a general proposition across the industry, I'd say yes, because of the amount, even though if you really kind of look at what percentage NPD constitutes of the business, it's been pretty stable in wine for quite a number of years now, at -- running at around 6%. So it seems like there's a lot of proliferation, but it's generally been the case for a long time. Now I think it's depends on who you are, I'd say for the leaders in the industry that have strong distribution relationships and even more importantly, strong key account relationships. The answer is, is that we can get distribution on our new products, and across the total beverage alcohol business, wine, beer and spirits in the United States, there's really only a few leaders in what we call category management. Only a couple. Okay, there's 2 or 3 companies, ourselves and a couple of our other competitors are the only companies that have world-class category management, which really means that we are the leaders in having the relationship of the key accounts that are going to matter for the future. And clearly, there's a shift going on in the business away from smaller liquor stores, mom-and-pop stores, consumers purchasing product at the large chains and mass merchandisers. And I'd say that as a consequence of a larger organization geared against that, years and years of developing those relationships, we enjoy very strong relationships with those key accounts. So we can get the distribution.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "That's great, and just one follow up on that. I saw that your relationship, I guess with Republic, was just renewed recently, I think a couple of months ago. Any change in terms that we should be aware of in that relationship?", "Robert S. Sands", "No. Fundamentally, the terms of the renewal are very similar to the previous agreement. We think that it's a very favorable agreement, in fact, for both parties. And we expect to see continued great performance from RNDC as we have had over the previous contract. So that's a relationship and an agreement that's working very, very well for both the relationship and a mechanical perspective.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA.", "Caroline Levy", "Just a question on distribution opportunity with retailers seeing the kind of takeaway from your brand versus others, are you expecting some big shelf set changes in '14 calendar? Because again, that -- you were talking about the draft opportunity, but what is the takeaway opportunity as well?", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes, I think we're looking at good growth in '14 across wine, beer and spirits. Our retail customers, are particularly pleased with our portfolio. I think that one of the interesting things about Constellation, which is an important differentiator is that we're the largest multi-category player in beverage alcohol or TBA as we call it, total beverage alcohol, which means that 2 of the large accounts, we're either the #1 or #2 supplier to them in dollar terms. And #1 is either us or ABI. And obviously, as it relates to our portfolio across wine, beer and spirits, we're providing the growth of being the #1 TBA supplier to the retailer. We're providing the growth, and TBA is probably the most important category in grocery and to the mass merchandisers today. It is not their #1 category, number one. Number two, of the major categories, it's the only growing category from both a dollar, top line and bottom line perspective, and it's providing much, much more profitability than any of the other major categories basically in grocery. And what are the other major categories, right? CSD [ph], cigarettes and dairy. So -- and TBA is #1, and we're either #1 or #2 with all the major players, right? Costco, SUPERVALU, Kroger, Safeway, so on and so forth. So -- and then, as I said, there's a shift that's just going on in general towards those kind of retailers for beverage alcohol. So, we're in a pretty good place.", "Robert P. Ryder", "The other thing I'd follow -- I'd say, a very good place, the other thing I'd follow up with here and I think you might have been hinting specifically at beer because one of our compelling beer stories to retailers is the well-known national brands that we provide that -- and retail shelves turn very fast. So we all see all this stuff written about SKU-getting [ph] in craft beer, right? And we're kind of used in this in wine, but there are a lot of SKUs. It does get a little confusing in the beer aisle these days, but we believe when we go to retailers, we have a very good story that, look, we have the distribution opportunity with our non-Corona Extra brands that we think will turn much better than almost all craft brands and deserve more shelf space. Indeed, we think Corona Extra deserves a lot more shelf space than it gets because it also turns much better than craft beers. It also grows like craft beers, right? Another reason to give it more space. And it has a higher ring and more profitability to the retailer like craft beers. So we think we're like -- to a retailer, we provide a lot of the benefits of craft beers, but we have much more scale and obviously, much more tenure in the industry to actually help them do some category management, that maybe the smaller, newer craft beers aren't as expert at yet. So I think that is really -- and we have fantastic sales execution and fantastic marketing plans behind those brands, so it's really kind of synchronistic to get this volume growth. The consumers want it, the retailers want it, the distributors want it, and, of course, we want it.", "Caroline Levy", "That makes sense. And then just looking at the brewery, you've owned it very briefly, but can you just fill us in on what you've discovered about running a brewery since you've owned it?", "Robert P. Ryder", "It's big. So I'll start -- here's what I'll say, is we -- and Rob said this earlier, that the employees we inherited at the brewery, we couldn't be happier with. They fit right into Constellation's culture. They are expert at their job and...", "Robert S. Sands", "Highly skilled.", "Robert P. Ryder", "And highly skilled. And really, it's been fantastically turnkey for us and we've been able to focus more our attention on the buildout, which they're also critical to. And the other good thing we inherited is the way Modelo ran the business was pretty decentralized. So we inherited a brewery with full functions. Human resource, finance, they operate very well as a team, and every -- they fit in so well with us because there's a lot of changes and a lot of complexity on assimilating this brewery and I couldn't give a higher grade than the grade we give them on assimilation, and as Rob said, real expertise in their jobs we're thrilled with. Hopefully, they're happy with us.", "Caroline Levy", "And in terms of risks of delays and stuff, which happens with any big project, generally, how would you handicap the risks of things not going exactly on time and on -- in terms of just not getting exactly where you thought you would be over the next 2 to 3 years?", "Robert S. Sands", "Right now, we anticipate completing the project on time, and we would handicap it as a low probability that we will not be able to finish the project on time.", "Caroline Levy", "Okay. And the spending being a little lower than maybe expected in the current quarter, last quarter, do you fully expect to catch up in the fourth quarter on that?", "Robert S. Sands", "Yes.", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, and spending will really ramp up. As Rob said, we're fabricating stainless steel, we're breaking ground, and the beehive will start being built because there's going to be a lot of activity around doubling the capacity of this brewery.", "Caroline Levy", "Okay. And then just moving to wine, and it's been a while since I looked at this in detail, but apparently, there is a lot of supply. And vats are full in Napa, in particular. Does that not mean there will be a lot of private label competition and so on? I mean, could margins be a little worse than you expect again as you go forward?", "Robert S. Sands", "I would say that the supply is balanced, is the way that I would describe it. I would say it's actually, over the last couple of years, depending on exactly where you're looking at, it sort of tips to slight undersupply. We've had a couple of decent harvests, which have, I'd say, tipped it to what I would call pretty much balanced. In the areas that matter to us, I would say that we're not expecting an oversupply that would drive lower pricing or higher promotion in the future. I think that we see a pretty balanced situation. And in fact, this is a general proposition, the way the wine business is growing overall and sort of given the level of plantings, especially, if we're talking about the United States. Things will continue to tip more towards undersupply.", "Robert P. Ryder", "I mean, that's a point -- I mean, the consumer demand for wine continues to be very robust and the mix shift also continues to be positive. So we actually need more supply just to satiate demand.", "Caroline Levy", "Okay. Great. And then just finally on the distributor renegotiations that are probably coming up with a number of wine and spirits distributors, do you largely expect similar terms to the ones you have, or is there room for some improvement for you there?", "Robert S. Sands", "I would say that we are hopeful. I think, first of all, I think we had great terms -- we have great terms to begin with, but I would be hopeful that there's room for improvement. Generally, that's going to be win-win for both parties. I mean, as we renegotiate these parties' contract, both parties look at the agreement to see what's working, what's not working, and adjustments are made to enhance the relationship for both parties. It's really the nature of it here, especially with wholesalers. It's not a one side can exact some kind of extreme favorable term out of the other side for no reason. But yes, we expect that there will be favorable enhancements to our agreements.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Carla Casella of JPMorgan.", "Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I have one quick balance sheet question here. The accounts payable were a little higher than expected for me, and I'm wondering if the terms are just different in the beer business than in the wine business? Or is there a timing issue going on there?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, terms are different in beer and wine, mostly due to regulations. So the accounts receivable terms are lower in beer than they are in wine, which is good working capital outcome. Accounts payable, there's just a lot of stuff going on with us assimilating brewery, there's a lot of timing stuff going on there.", "Carla Casella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then your cash flow, your strong guidance for the year, does that imply you should just take every 2014 million -- I'm sorry, 2014 bond maturity with cash flow, or do you intend to refinance it?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Yes, we're still looking at that. But we'll -- in this environment, we're happy to see that go because I think it's at 8 3/8. Right now, the thinking is we won't have to refinance that. It'll just be financed from our revolver and securitization facilities which, of course, are at much lower coupons. That should be very positive arbitrage for us.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Karen Eltrich of Mitsubishi.", "Karen Eltrich", "As we look at the year ahead, what are your thoughts with regards to priority of free cash flow, and as you make your manufacturing expansions, what kind of capacity increases can we expect?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Well, I mean, our priorities in the medium term on free cash flow is to pay down debt, which we've been doing. As we said, our debt was about $165 million less in Q3. We paid some debt down. We want to get our leverage below 4x EBITDA, but as you referred to, we've got a lot of builds coming our way. We've got, I'll say, the final tranche on purchase price, which we referred to right nets [ph] -- just shy of $600 million, which we talked about. And then we've got the brewery buildout, which, of course, is pretty big money over 3 years and a decent amount of that is front-loaded. So -- but we think we have all the financing we need to pay those bills, and we still think we can get below 4x EBITDA leverage by fiscal '17. Because you see, the beer this year is generating more cash than we originally anticipated. So we'll take it and pay that debt down.", "Karen Eltrich", "Great. And then in terms of what kind of capacity expansion is -- are these builds going to produce for you?", "Robert P. Ryder", "Well, the brewery is doubling its capacity from 10 million hectoliters to 20 million hectoliters.", "Operator", "As of this time, there are no further questions. I will now return the call to Rob Sands for any closing remarks.", "Robert S. Sands", "Well, thanks for joining our call today, everyone. Needless to say, we're very excited about the fact that our newly consolidated beer business is performing extremely well and driving enhanced consolidated results for the year. We certainly believe that we are well positioned in both wine and spirits as we currently stand, and are confident that our accomplishments in these businesses will position us well for the future. And overall, we feel very good about a solid final quarter for our fiscal year.

Well, it has certainly been another productive and very exciting year at Constellation. It was just about one year ago at this time when we received regulatory approval to proceed with the completion of our most transformational acquisition in the history of our company.", "As you know, the beer deal has positioned Constellation as the largest multi-category supplier for beer, wine, and spirits. We are not only the third largest total beverage alcohol company in the United States, but the number three brewer and seller of beer for the U.S. market as well as the largest marketer of imported beer. And to reinforce our position as a top-tiered player in this space, we posted the highest dollar sales growth in IRI channels for fiscal 2014 amongst our key competitors in the total beverage alcohol category. Our fiscal 2014 results are a testament to the significant contribution that our beer business is making as we had an exceptional year posting sales, profits and cash flow that were better than our expectations for both the Crown commercial business and our new brewery in Nava, Mexico.", "The beer segment generated sales growth of 10% with corresponding depletion growth of nearly 8%, which represents a significant outperformance of the import category and the overall U.S. beer market. As a matter of fact, in fiscal 2014, our beer business accounted for 85% of total import category dollar sales growth and gained more than 50 basis points of market share of the U.S. beer industry in IRI channels. So what\u2019s driving this phenomenal level of growth, it\u2019s a combination of robust consumer demand, strong sales execution, excellent support from our wholesalers, creative new marketing and advertising programs as well as the outstanding efforts of our commercial team and our brewery team in Mexico.", "I would like to take a minute to share some of this past year\u2019s amazing accomplishments for our iconic beer brands. As you know Corona Extra is the best selling imported beer at more than 100 million cases and is now outselling the nearest import competitor by almost 50 million cases. By executing well designed marketing campaigns and leveraging its brand equity, Corona Extra posted depletion growth of almost 4% in group volumes by nearly 2.5 million cases in fiscal 2014, jumping to the fifth best selling beer overall, while posting positive volume trends for the third consecutive year.", "As for Corona Light it is the best selling imported light beer at more than 13.5 million cases and continues to strengthen its own identity with its creative advertising that is driving consumers to trade up from domestic lights. Overall Corona Light is outpacing the import light category and currently represents more than 50% of segment dollar share in IRI channels.", "Modelo Especial is the fastest growing Constellation beer brand, with depletion growth of almost 20% in fiscal 2014. It exceeded the 50 million case milestones during the year with the most volume gains and largest volume trend of any top 15 beer brand. Pacifico increased volumes 5%, which marks three consecutive years of volume growth and Negra Modelo posted its fourth consecutive year of annual volume growth at 4%. While draft currently represents a small part of our overall volume, depletions grew more than 35% for this format, increasing brand recognition for Corona Light, Negra Modelo, and Pacifico brand throughout fiscal 2014. The five core brands within the Constellation beer portfolio are ranked in the top 15 imports and collectively account for more than 175 million cases representing greater than 50% of the volume of this category in 2013.", "Overall, as we begin fiscal 2015, we will be focused on the following strategies from our beer business perspective. The continued expansion of our new brewery in Nava, Mexico, which I will discuss in more detail in a few moments, maintaining the marketplace momentum for the commercial side of the beer business with incremental investments in marketing and SG&A and finally driving the great organic growth opportunities within this product portfolio. I am excited about the organic growth prospects for our beer business in fiscal 2015, as we are once again targeting sales and depletion trends to exceed U.S. beer industry and import trends.", "Some of the initiatives we have underway to drive these results include the following. As we head into the Cinco de Mayo holiday, we will continue to build our Corona de Mayo equity to reinforce our positioning around Summer\u2019s First Fiesta to create momentum to keep Corona top of mind with consumers and our wholesalers as we kick off our 120 Days of Summer. Our 120 Days of Summer campaign will highlight 18 different weekly themes with special activities, content and prize drawings. The goal is to own the summer by driving repeat consumer engagement and purchase throughout the key summer selling season.", "New Corona national TV and digital video that launched recently to support these efforts will ramp up leading into Cinco de Mayo with high profile media properties that includes the NBA Playoffs on national TV. In addition, promotional, digital and radio advertising and digital video sponsorships will launch leading into key occasions, including the World Cup and the ESPN NFL Draft. To continue to reach new consumers and increase awareness of the brand, Corona Light recently expanded its draft offering to over 100 distributors and 35 markets. This launch will be supported by 15-second advertising spots airing with high profile sports programs that position the brand as a light beer with taste.", "Two new ads from Modelo Especial\u2019s Hispanic Real World campaign will launch in the first quarter with strong support and targeted Spanish language TV and digital video programming. In addition, Modelo Especial will feature a 2014 summer promotion that includes a sweepstake with three prize tiers, including a custom soccer tour to three global soccer destinations. A natural launch of Modelo Especial Chelada began April 1. This initiative is supported by Spanish-language TV ads on national Spanish networks, consumers sampling at retail, PR in key markets, social media engagements and C-store print trade ads. In its first six months since launch, Modelo Especial Chelada has significantly outpaced our distribution and volume forecast.", "From a brewery and operational perspective, we began fiscal 2014 by successfully completing the initial transition of our new brewery in Nava, Mexico. As you know, we are currently concentrating our effort on doubling the size of this brewery from 10 million to 20 million hectoliters, including the build of a new brew house, packaging area and warehouse as well as completion of site infrastructure. Overall, beer operations continue to run smoothly. The beer expansion project remains on time and all major brewery key performance metrics and initiatives are on or better than target. Establishing foundations for the brewing area are well underway. Mass excavation for the packaging area is in progress and the first shipment of brewery tanks is expected to arrive shortly. There are more than 500 construction people on site each day with that number growing significantly over the next few months.", "As we have progressed with this major undertaking, we have determined that we need to increase the capital required to complete the brewery expansion from our original estimate of $500 million to $600 million. The primary drivers of the increased investment to a range of $900 million to $1.1 billion include the following. This most significant incremental cost related to outsourcing and utilizing third-party external engineering resources and consultants versus the initial brewery build by Modelo, which has the benefit of utilizing in-house resources. In addition, the timeline for the current expansion is much shorter than that of Modelo\u2019s original build resulting in additional costs for expediting much of this project.", "Other incremental expenses include inflation on materials since the original brewery build and investments to improve brewery efficiency and flexibility to enhance overall capacity utilization in order to support the growth of the business. In a few moments, Bob will provide additional details about how this incremental spend will impact free cash flow and our de-leveraging efforts going forward.", "Now, turning to the wine and spirits business, before we begin our year end review and discussion of our wine and spirits plans for fiscal 2015, I\u2019d like to mention that I am very pleased we have reached a long-term strategic agreement with VATS Liquor, a Chinese producer and distributor of spirits and wine. We plan to jointly develop and exclusively market and promote the iconic Robert Mondavi brand, which is world\u2019s number one selling table wine.", "And China, China is currently the fifth largest wine consumption market globally selling more than 200 million cases annually. It\u2019s a market that has doubled in size in five years. Category growth in China continues to be driven by imports which are projected to comprise about one-third of total wine consumption within the next five years. We are looking forward to working with VATS who has a vast distribution network, professional brand building capabilities and an established retail presence for consumers to buy fine wine and spirits.", "And now I would like to focus our discussion on Constellation\u2019s year end results for our wine and spirits business as well as our strategic plans for the year ahead. As we discussed, fiscal 2014 represented the year of focus on brand building activity for our U.S. wine and spirits business in order to ensure that our business remained healthy and was positioned to generate profit growth going forward. These activities included incremental promotion and marketing investments that enabled us to maintain our marketplace momentum by achieving market share volume gains and above market depletion trends of 3.5% across our entire U.S. wine and spirits portfolio, while our collection of Focus Brands grew at almost 6% for the year.", "In addition, we were able to maintain dollar share in measured channels. As a result of these efforts, we continue to garner awards and recognition for prominent industry publications, particularly for our new products and our Focus Brands. They include the following. We won 11 2013 Hot Brand awards from Impact Magazine and several of our new brands landed on Beverage Information Group\u2019s list of 2014 Growth Brand Awards. Our Focus Brands that received these awards included Kim Crawford, Mark West, Black Box, SVEDKA Vodka, Ruffino, Rex Goliath and Woodbridge, just to name a few.", "And our new product offers \u2013 offerings included on the awards list were The Dreaming Tree and Thorny Rose. The Dreaming Tree also received the distinction of Best New Wine Product from MarketWatch. From a spirits perspective, for fiscal 2014 SVEDKA posted double digit consumers takeaway trends in IRI channels in addition to gaining volume and dollar share of the vodka category. SVEDKA is currently the number two imported vodka brand and a top 10 spirit brand in the U.S. In fiscal 2015, we plan to capitalize on the continued growth of flavored vodkas by launching Mango, Pineapple and Strawberry Lemonade as additions to SVEDKA\u2019s flavor lineup. For the year, Black Velvet grew volumes 11% in IRI channels driven by the core Black Velvet brand as well as new flavor introductions Toasted Caramel and Cinnamon Rush.", "From a wine and spirits strategic perspective in fiscal 2015, we plan to leverage the hard work and significant accomplishments we have made throughout the last several years to grow profits for this business, while also growing revenue. And we are committed to executing the following strategies in an effort to make this goal a reality. Number one, our marketing efforts will be focused on a subset of Focus Brands in order to drive key brands that have scale, higher margin and the greatest growth potential. Number two, we will continue to drive margin accretive innovation and new product development. Number three, we plan to increase points of distribution and deliver more effective feature and display activity at retail with added accountability and visibility for both Constellation and our distributors. Number four, for the first time in several years we plan to execute price increases for select products in the value and luxury segments of the market where pricing is currently occurring. And number five we will minimize COGS increase through continued global blend management initiatives and lower grape cost. Overall, we plan to limit our marketing expense to grow in line with our net revenue with the concentration of spend focused on key margin accretive Focus Brands.", "One of the things that will impact fiscal 2015 financial results for our wine and spirits business, particularly in the first quarter is that we are working with one of our exclusive distributors to reduce their inventory levels. Because this action is outside the scope of their contractual arrangement with us, they have agreed to a make whole payment as they begin to reduce their purchases of our products. As I mentioned, this is primarily a first quarter event and will have a minor impact on sales for the year. In a few minutes, Bob will discuss the financial implications of this action from a P&L perspective.", "Before I close, I would like to address the potential drought issue in California as we have received several inquiries related to this topic. Fortunately, grape wines are highly drought resistant and can actually produce better fruit in dry conditions. At this stage, our California wines have begun to bud and the state in general is running approximately two weeks ahead of schedule. While recent heavy rains have improved our overall position, California is still officially in drought status and at this time we do not yet know the potential overall impact from this situation, because it is too early to call. If drought conditions persist, we have the ability to source bulk wine from around the world in order to supplement which could potentially be a short harvest. Keep in mind that an above average harvest last year created a situation, where we currently have adequate supply.", "In closing, we had a great year driven by our beer business. We also achieved above market depletion growth and market share gains across our beer and wine businesses. The strong operating cash flow that we are generating will allow us to capitalize on value creating opportunities going forward and the new Constellation is well-positioned to drive value for the future.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our year end business results and our outlook for fiscal 2015.", "Bob Ryder", "Thanks, Rob. Good morning everyone. As we close out fiscal \u201814 and move forward into fiscal \u201815 which is very exciting time at Constellation for employees, investors, lenders, vendors and consumers. As Rob said, fiscal \u201814 was a very strong year, where we closed our beer transaction, maintained or grew market share and are growing beverage alcohol categories, established some all-time highs with EBIT up nearly 60% and comparable basis EPS almost 50% while generating sales approaching $5 billion and free cash flow which surpassed the $600 million mark. And we exceeded all consolidated guidance metrics provided at the beginning of the year.", "We expect fiscal \u201815 to be another exciting year. We expect to maintain or grow market share and grow EBIT at or above our sales growth on an organic basis. On an absolute comparable basis, performance will be much better as we enjoy our full year of consolidated beer economics and we expect operating cash flow to cross the $1 billion mark.", "Let\u2019s begin to look at fiscal \u201814 results. Our comparable basis diluted EPS for fiscal \u201814 came in at $3.25. This represents a sizable increase versus last year as we continue to realize the tremendous accretion attributable to the beer business acquisition, which is significantly enhancing our sales, operating profit, operating margin and free cash flow. The strong marketplace momentum and financial performance for the beer business continued in Q4. This drove year-to-date financial results ahead of our expectations and capped off a phenomenal year for Constellation.", "Given those brief highlights, let\u2019s look at full year fiscal 2014 performance in more detail where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our news release, consolidated net sales for the year included $2 billion of incremental net sales related to the beer business acquisition as we consolidated 100% of beer sales as of the June 7, 2013 acquisition date.", "For fiscal 2014, beer segment net sales increased nearly 10% on volume growth of 7%. Depletions were equally strong growing close to 8%. Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 2%. This reflects an organic branded wine and spirits shipment volume increase of almost 4%, partially offset by higher promotion expense, unfavorable mix, and lower bulk spirit sales.", "For the year, consolidated gross profit increased $892 million. As you know, under the Crown joint venture structure, we recognized our share of Crown\u2019s earnings on the equity earnings line. Since the close of the beer transaction, 100% of Crown\u2019s results along with the Mexican beer production profit stream are consolidated by Constellation. Incremental gross profit from the consolidation of beer was $891 million. This produced a beer segment gross margin of 44% based on the incremental beer sales discussed earlier. For the year, our consolidated gross margin was 41.2% versus 39.9% for the prior year. This increase primarily reflects the benefit from the consolidation of the beer business, partially offset by lower gross margin in wine and spirits, driven by the higher promotion expense.", "SG&A for the year increased $280 million. The incremental SG&A associated with consolidating the beer business was $260 million. Essentially all of the SG&A for the beer business is related to Crown as the brewery has very little costs classified as SG&A. The remainder of the SG&A increase was primarily driven by higher selling and marketing investments in the wine and spirits business. Based on what I just outlined, incremental operating income generated by the beer business was $630 million for the year. This produced a beer segment operating margin of approximately 31% since the close of the acquisition. The inclusion of the beer business results was the primary driver between the \u2013 behind the 410 basis point improvement in our consolidated operating margin for the year.", "Equity earnings from the Crown joint venture totaled $70 million compared to $220 million in the prior year. The decrease was due to the timing of the beer business acquisition. Interest expense for the year was $323 million, up 42% versus last year. The increase reflects higher average borrowings as a result of the acquisition funding, partially offset by a lower average interest rate.", "That provides a good spot to discuss our debt position. At the end of February, our total debt was $7 billion. This represents a $3.7 billion increase from our debt levels at the end of fiscal \u201813. The increase primarily reflects the financing for the beer business acquisition, partially offset by some of our cash build in advance of the transaction and our free cash flow generation. I would also like to remind you that in June, we expect to make a $558 million post closing purchase price adjustment payment for the beer transaction. We also have $500 million of 8 3/8% senior notes that are coming due in December. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 31%, which reflected benefits from integrating the beer business and the benefit of foreign tax credits.", "Now, let\u2019s briefly discuss Q4 results. Comparable basis diluted EPS for the quarter came in at $0.81. The quarter reflected significant acquisition benefits. And as mentioned earlier, beer performance exceeded expectations. For Q4, beer segment net sales increased 13% on volume growth of 10%. This was somewhat offset \u2013 this was somewhat of an easier comparison versus Q4 last year when sales increased 1%. Consumer demand remained strong as depletions for the quarter were up nearly 12%. Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 1% as volume growth was mostly offset by unfavorable mix and higher promotional spend.", "Now, let\u2019s discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For fiscal \u201814, we generated $603 million of free cash flow versus $494 million in the previous year. This result exceeded our expectation primarily as a result of the strong beer business performance in Q4.", "Operating cash flow for the year totaled $826 million, an increase of $270 million over last year. The increase was primarily due to the profit growth for the beer business acquisition partially offset by higher interest payments and lower contribution from wine and spirits primarily due to some working capital timing.", "CapEx for the year totaled $224 million, an increase of $161 million. CapEx for the beer segment totaled $137 million. Most of the beer spending occurred in the fourth quarter as brewery expansion activities began to ramp up.", "Now, let\u2019s move to our full year fiscal 2015 P&L outlook. We are forecasting comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $3.95 to $4.15 a share. For fiscal 2015, we are targeting mid-to-high single-digit net sales growth for the beer segment. Shipment and depletion volumes are targeted to grow mid single-digits and continue to outpace the import category and the total beer industry.", "For fiscal 2014, beer segment operating income totaled $773 million. This amount is presented in our summarized segment information in our press release financial statements and includes 100% of Crown\u2019s operating income for all of fiscal 2014 and brewery profits since the June 7 acquisition date. For fiscal 2015, we expect beer segment operating income to grow in the low to mid 20% range. Excluding the estimated brewery acquisition benefit, underlying operating income growth for the beer segment is expected to be in the 10% to 12% range. For wine and spirits, we are targeting net sales growth to be in the low to mid single-digit range. Volume growth is expected to be in the low single-digit range and we expect to generate positive mix.", "While we expect depletions to track in line or better than the U.S. wine and spirits category for the year, shipment volumes are projected to be lower than depletions as we expect some distributor inventory reduction to occur during the first quarter as Rob highlighted earlier. Operating income growth for wine and spirits is expected to align with net sales growth in the low to mid single-digit range. Headwinds from grape costs are expect to abate as we continue to realize benefits from blend management initiatives and we begin to move into lower priced grape inventories.", "We expect promotional and marketing spending to stabilize and we are increasing prices on some products in the value and luxury categories as Rob outlined earlier. We also expect mix to be favorable in the fiscal \u201815 as we focus more of our investment on higher margin products. Interest expense is expected to be in the range of $345 million to $355 million. The increase versus fiscal \u201814 is primarily being driven by the beer acquisition funding impact that carries into Q1 of fiscal \u201815. The tax rate is expected to approximate 30%. This represents a slight decrease versus the fiscal \u201814 comparable basis tax rate as we expect to realize some favorable outcomes on various tax items.", "Free cash flow is expected to be in the range of $425 million to $500 million. Operating cash flow is targeted to reach at least $1 billion as we continue to realize earnings benefits from the beer business transaction. CapEx is projected in the range of $575 million to $625 million, including $450 million to $500 million for the beer business driven by the brewery expansion activities outlined by Rob. We are still on track to complete the brewery in calendar 2016. Although the brewery expansion CapEx is higher than our original estimate, beer volumes and profits are also higher. Even with the higher CapEx spend, our goals of reaching $1 billion of free cash flow in fiscal \u201817 and moving our debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio below four times in fiscal \u201816 remain intact.", "I would now like to mention a couple of items from a fiscal \u201815 quarterly gating perspective. As discussed earlier for wine and spirits, we expect some distributor inventory destocking to mostly occur during Q1, which will impact our shipment volume. As a result, we expect net sales to be down in the low to mid-single digit range for Q1. However, we don\u2019t expect this to negatively impact profits as we will receive a make-whole payment from the distributor related to this activity in the same timeframe. I would also like to note that our targeted wine and spirits EBIT growth for fiscal \u201815 is weighted toward the second half of the year.", "From a beer gating perspective, I would like to note that we will be facing some difficult comparisons in the second half of the year. Our comparable basis guidance excludes unusual items, which are detailed on the last page of the release. We currently estimate one-time cost at $60 million in fiscal \u201815. This includes about $25 million in professional services and transition costs associated with the beer business acquisition. These costs were originally expected to occur in fiscal \u201814, but shifted to fiscal \u201815. The remaining $35 million represents amortization expense related to the acquisition accounting asset established for the interim supply agreement for beer finished goods.", "I would like to make a few brief comments on commodity risk management. We have begun to hedge certain commodities in the energy and agricultural categories. These commodity derivatives generally do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. As a result mark to market unrealized gains and losses on open hedge contracts will flow through our GAAP income statement. We will exclude these unrealized gains and losses from our comparable earnings. At the time that a gain or loss is realized on a commodity hedged, it will be allocated to the appropriate business segment for reporting and will be included in our comparable earnings. This approach is in line with other companies in the consumer space. We began this reporting in the fourth quarter. At the end of fiscal \u201814, it was an immaterial unrealized gain related to this activity.", "Before we take your questions, I would like to highlight that the beer acquisition has been a game changer. In addition to the positive financial impact of the acquisition, our commercial performance has accelerated dramatically. Despite the increased cost to build out the brewery, our improved commercial results keep our free cash flow and deleveraging goals intact. The improved commercial performance of the beer business improves our financial profile and we currently anticipate exceeding our original IRR and shareholder value assumptions for the beer transaction despite higher capital costs for the 20 million hectoliter build out.", "With that, we are happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC.", "Nik Modi - RBC", "Yes, thanks. Good morning everyone. Just two questions on my end. If you can just kind of reiterate, I am sorry if I missed it, how much CapEx has already been spent on the brewery expansion. And then the second question is really trying to frame the opportunity that you might have in China, certainly long-term it makes sense and probably a big opportunity, just trying to get some texture on how much of a P&L implication it could have in the next 18 months or so?", "Bob Ryder", "Sure, Nik. I will handle the first one and Rob can handle the China question. As far as how much capital was spent on the brewery in fiscal \u201814 that was just shy of $140 million and that pretty much all occurred in the fourth quarter.", "Nik Modi - RBC", "On to China?", "Rob Sands", "Sure. Hi, Nik. China, I think you really have to look at that as the long-term investment or I would say a long-term project. We are just really kind of getting up and running and developing our plans. It hasn\u2019t been a material business there historically. So, the idea is developing it into a material business in that market, but it\u2019s going to take a number of years. So, I wouldn\u2019t expect it to have any real impact from a financial perspective in the short-term.", "Nik Modi - RBC", "Great. And just one quick follow-up, I know it\u2019s still early in the transaction, but the margins have been tracking ahead of I think what most people have been expecting and I know there is still a lot of spending to come in the beer business, but have you thought about the 30% to 35% since you kind of initially gave that guidance, and if you think there is kind of where you might be in that range at the higher end maybe even able to exceed that at some point in the next couple of years?", "Bob Ryder", "Yes Nik. We are not updating our guidance in that area. We would be happy if it exceeds it, but we have still got quite a few of steps involved in negotiating our commodity contracts as a standalone company. Going forward, as you know, we have talked about \u2013 we haven\u2019t settled anything on glass, which is a big piece of the cost, cost inputs for our business. So, we are very happy with the progress of the project, certainly the progress of the beer business, but we are not changing our margin guidance. What might be throwing people off a little bit is maybe in the fourth quarter, the beer business had increased margins and really what that is, is in the fourth quarter again I think volumes exceeded our expectations, but we spent accounting wise very little marketing in the fourth quarter. So, you had a pretty high level of sale certainly growth to the prior year with very little marketing expense against it. For the full year, the margin from the date of acquisition through the end of year was about 31%, which was a little bit higher than what we guided when the transaction just started, but very much in the ballpark. So, we are sticking to that mid 30% operating profit margin guidance.", "Nik Modi - RBC", "Fair enough. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.", "Bryan Spillane - Bank of America", "Hey, good morning.", "Rob Sands", "Hey, Bryan.", "Bob Ryder", "Hey, Bryan.", "Bryan Spillane - Bank of America", "Just two questions, the first one just related to the capital spending in, I think this is the crux of why the stock has responded the way it has this morning. Bob, could you walk through first now that you have got a better sort of perspective or a deeper perspective on the project and the cost increase. Is the brewery going to be more efficient and is there an enhancement in efficiencies both in the existing capacity and maybe what you are going to be building versus what you originally thought? And then the second question related to that is just I think there is some concern and you have got the run rate right now on volume growth and beer is very strong and how do we think about the potential to have to add more capacity going forward? Does the increase in spending at all make it less expensive to add capacity going forward?", "Rob Sands", "So, yes, Bryan, I will answer that for you. Number one, the fundamental answer to your question is yes, we are designing the brewery in a manner to get more volume out of the capacity that we originally planned. So, we are expanding the brewery from 10 million to 20 million hectoliters in theoretical capacity that still remains the case, but in terms of the efficiency, i.e., how many cases will actually get out of that? We are expanding the brewery in a manner to get more cases out of that than we originally planned. That\u2019s point number one. So, we are taking steps in that regard to plan for higher volumes than we originally anticipated.", "And then with respect to your second question, the capacity that we are currently building we do expect to be sufficient on four, I would say the mid-term meaning the next few years. But if the business continues to grow at the rate that it\u2019s currently growing, we will have to be thinking about additional capacity increases sometime in the near future in the next couple of years and to begin that process so a good problem to have in essence.", "Bob Ryder", "Yes. And Bryan just to follow-up on Rob, we are currently assessing because volumes are doing so well. When do you expand capacity and where do you expand capacity, so related to that question if we were to put the next tranche of capacity expansion at the existing brewery, I think we would get some efficiencies from the $1 billion we are spending on the first 20 million hectoliters. If we decided to put the capacity somewhere else meaning you build another brewery or buy a brewery somewhere, then that wouldn\u2019t help us so much. So we are currently in the thought process around that.", "Bryan Spillane - Bank of America", "And then fair to characterize the higher price tag especially for the outsourcing in part helps to ensure that you meet the calendar \u201916 deadline, meaning you are sort of paying to get the front of the line?", "Rob Sands", "Yes, there is definitely a premium that we are paying to complete the project within the three year timeframe. There is no question about that. It\u2019s pretty much half the timeframe in which the original brewery is built and it\u2019s a pretty compressed timetable. And we have got to do everything in our power to ensure that the brewery is built in that timeframe, so.", "Bob Ryder", "Yes, we are happy to see that even with that increased capital costs as I mentioned earlier because I know a lot of investors are keeping an eye on our de-leveraging and keeping an eye on when we potentially reallocate capital. So all those de-leveraging targets and free cash flow targets even though we have increased these capital spend they all remain intact. So frankly after you get past the brewery, right what that means and you guys know your math guys right is the EBIT higher, right. So that\u2019s going to drive much better returns after you get past this stage where kind of the snake is eating a camel.", "Bryan Spillane - Bank of America", "Got it. Okay, I am going to get back in the queue. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust.", "Bill Chappell - SunTrust", "Good morning. Just want to follow-up one more time on Bryan\u2019s questions, excuse me. So I was just to trying to understand over the past maybe six to nine months at what point did it seems like the timeline for the new plant is still the same and the size is still the same, where did all of a sudden it changed in terms of your budgeted costs, I mean what came about really changed that versus what we saw kind of six to nine months ago when you are first talking about this?", "Rob Sands", "Yes, well six to nine months ago we had obviously just closed the deal. We have very short timeframe to actually decide and agree to purchase the brewery and purchase it, we put together at that time a very rough estimate of what we thought the cost would be and we spent the last basically nine months bidding out the project and translating it into definitive cost which have resulted in the number that we disclosed. So there was definitely changes in the scope of the project from what we also originally \u2013 what we originally thought. And it was along the lines that Bryan suggested in that, although we are building the same 20 million theoretical capacity, okay and we expect to get more out of it and scope the project to get more out of it than originally planned. So whereas you might only get 80% or 85% efficiency out of your theoretical capacity, we are building the brewery now to get more out of it than that. Really as the result of the increased growth in the products that we are experiencing and that we expect to continue into the next fiscal years. So that\u2019s basically why or how the brewery project cost increased from our original estimates which were really in many respects just a swag, in that we \u2013 it had not been able at that stage and obviously so to bid the project and to scope it fully.", "Bill Chappell - SunTrust", "Got it. And then just a couple of things also on the beer, wasn\u2019t there at some point a change in the price you are paying for the 40% outsourced and will that change, any update on that? And then on the beer pricing in general is your guide to assuming a price increase for kind of the fiscal 2015?", "Bob Ryder", "Yes, there was a price reset for what we pay InBev for the finished goods that they are making for us based on the audited EBITDA of the acquired business, but building the brewery out does not change any of that. Those numbers are still intact.", "Bill Chappell - SunTrust", "Sure. And then in terms of overall pricing for this year to the consumer for the next year?", "Bob Ryder", "Yes, I mean, on pricing, we will \u2013 as we said before, beer is a very regional business. So, we look at what\u2019s going on with volumes and what\u2019s going on with competitors in our various different regions and we talk to distributors, we talk to retailers to try to assume what will happen to volumes, what will consumers\u2019 reactions be to the price increase, and then we determine what that price increase will be on a regional basis, then it kind of rolls up. So, the only way you will know kind of what happens is to watch IRI, generally beer pricing occurs right after the peak summer season. So, September, October, you will be able to see what the big boys have done and what we have done and we take a guess generally what pricing would be when we give guidance. So that\u2019s included in the volume and net sales guidance you would have seen in our beer segment.", "Bill Chappell - SunTrust", "Okay. I will get back in the queue. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA.", "Caroline Levy - CLSA", "Good morning, everyone. Thank you so much. One of my questions is can you tell us what the difference was between beer volumes in California and in the rest of the country? I am trying to drive at mainly what the drought impact was on demand, but also my understanding is that in areas where Corona is strongest, it\u2019s actually growing faster. So, if you can just sort of disaggregate a little bit of what you understand about your beer business?", "Bob Ryder", "Yes, there is a couple of things going on there, Caroline. We actually did have a very strong year in California. It\u2019s our highest share state. It\u2019s kind of where Corona began. I think we are around 20% share. But as Rob mentioned in his statements, right, they are experiencing a drought in California, so actually we experienced very good beer weather in California. And we also have like elsewhere in the country, very good consumer momentum from our great marketing and our great sales initiatives, but we did have pretty favorable weather for beer in California and we are very happy with our results out there in fiscal \u201814.", "Caroline Levy - CLSA", "But I am just trying to understand what happened in the rest of the country, was the rest of the country up sort of mid single-digit?", "Bob Ryder", "Yes, we had our strongest performance in fiscal \u201814 in the west and the south. We had strong performance, but not as strong in the Midwest and the East. Okay, it\u2019s kind of how we broke out regionally, but we grew in every geography, we gained share in every geography, we grew in every channel, we gained share in every channel, but we did better in the west and the south.", "Caroline Levy - CLSA", "Right, okay, thank you. Now, just moving to wine, the issue with the distributor inventories is this one distributor, is this something that\u2019s a one quarter phenomenon, if you could just help us understand a little more about what\u2019s going on there and how long it will take to work through the system?", "Bob Ryder", "Sure. It\u2019s \u2013 yes, the answer is it\u2019s one distributor and yes, we are anticipating that it will be a one quarter or first quarter phenomenon and as we mentioned it will have no impact on our bottom line, no impact on earnings whatsoever.", "Caroline Levy - CLSA", "Okay. And as we think through one, I mean it\u2019s always got challenges, but always for different reasons, but as a long-term top line growth rate is 3% to 4% reasonable sort of assumption given a blend of volume and \u2013 I mean volume and pricing do you think that still holds?", "Bob Ryder", "Yes, Caroline definitely sort of the 3%, 4% range is sort of a good number that\u2019s sort of what the industry has been growing at. We are pretty optimistic about our wine business going into this year, our 2015 fiscal year as I have mentioned we got a lot of I am going to say tailwind this year. We have been focusing for the last few years on developing strong momentum behind our brands making sure our brands are healthy. And as we move into 2015, I think that our brands are healthier than they have ever been and that positions our self well to capitalize on that and take some actions to drive profit growth as I said. So I think that that business is going to be \u2013 it\u2019s going to make a very good contribution to our bottom line growth this year.", "Caroline Levy - CLSA", "Got it. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein of ISI.", "Rob Ottenstein - ISI", "Thank you, guys. Can you give us your latest assessment in terms of when you may start paying a dividend, has that changed and also your thinking on M&A, is there any change there?", "Bob Ryder", "Sure, I will handle the first. I will let Rob handle the second. The dividend we haven\u2019t changed the way we are thinking about it is we would start assessing redeploying capital to shareholders when we get close to being below four times EBITDA leverage and that goal has not changed. It looks like that will happen if everything happens the way we think towards the end of fiscal \u201816 is when we will get below that leverage ratio. So we would start to talk to investors and our Board in inverse order of course around that time. I will let Rob handle the M&A question.", "Rob Sands", "Yes. So on M&A the answer is our position or our strategy has not changed relative to M&A. Our principle goal at the moment is debt pay down that\u2019s really what we are focused on, but obviously M&A is opportunistic, so we keep our ear to the ground for investments that we think will generate superior returns to our shareholders. But generally the focus is debt pay down versus M&A.", "Rob Ottenstein - ISI", "And Bob, given the tremendous success of the beer business that you are achieving and the transformation of the company as you look to do incremental investment, do you see yourself gearing more towards beer or more towards wine, has that changed at all in terms of where you are looking to take the company long-term?", "Rob Sands", "Well, as I have said, we are certainly focused on debt pay down at the current time, but as it relates to investments there is potentially good investments in all three categories. We look at it very fundamentally. I mean, we don\u2019t have a favorite child necessarily. And so as opportunities arise we are going to look at investment opportunities in all three categories. And they will be evaluated on what generates the highest return in the shortest amount of time. That\u2019s basically the bottom line right, IRR and payback. So we will see.", "Rob Ottenstein - ISI", "Are you taking a look at PBR?", "Patty Yahn-Urlaub", "Okay, Robert, I think we are going to move to the next question.", "Rob Sands", "Well, we can\u2019t comment on that obviously Robert.", "Rob Ottenstein - ISI", "Alright, thanks guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brett Cooper of Consumer Edge Research.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research", "Good morning, guys. Two questions, one on the beer side, one on the wine side, on the beer side, I am not sure if I missed it in your commentary, but what was marketing or what are you planning marketing to be up in \u201814?", "Bob Ryder", "In \u201815 or in \u201814?", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research", "I am sorry in fiscal \u201815?", "Bob Ryder", "Yes. So in the beer business, we are investing commercially both sales and marketing, investing ahead of sales, because we want to keep our momentum up and because the sales and marketing guys have some good ideas that we think are worthy of investing in. So marketing and sales will be going up faster than sales. Marketing in the beer business is about 8%, 8.5% of sales which has gone up over the last three to five years.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research", "Perfect. And then on the wine side, back to the distributor inventory reduction, how did that come about, who drove it, and as some of your other distributor contracts come to an end if memory serves, would you expect to see more of these types of deals? And then as a side to that, when these things have happened in the past, sometimes you hedge your distributors than more against the brands in the market, this time you are getting a payment, can you just explain your thoughts on receiving a payment versus a greater investment in the marketplace from your distributor?", "Rob Sands", "Sure. Number one, this is the particular circumstances of one distributor who desired to do something really outside of the parameters of our normal business relationship. That\u2019s the answer number one. Answer number two is no, we don\u2019t have any expectation that it will occur in any other context or in any other cases. And number three since it\u2019s outside of our normal contractual relationship we felt that a make whole kind of arrangement was most appropriate in this particular case. And more importantly, as far as what we invest in the marketplace behind our business, we determine that completely on a commercial basis meaning it\u2019s not based on any payments that we might receive or might not receive. We will spend what we think is appropriate to drive the business in any event. So it just still happens that with the way this particular transaction is structured, we don\u2019t expect it to have any impact on the bottom line. And it is a \u2013 it is an isolated matter with one wholesale customer. So we bring it really to your attention and only in that it will affect the top line. In the first quarter, we really expect the top line materially even for the whole year. And as you said, it will have no impact on the bottom line. So that\u2019s really, that\u2019s it.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research", "Perfect, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Hunt of Wells Fargo Securities.", "Bryan Hunt - Wells Fargo Securities", "Thank you. Two questions. One, Rob, when you start to talk about pricing and the value in the luxury segment of the wine business, it sounded as though you were a follower and not a leader, can you discuss maybe the level of pricing and clarify whether Constellation is leading or following price increases in the wine segment?", "Rob Sands", "Yes, I would say, we have about a 15% total market share in the wine segment. As you know, it\u2019s a pretty fragmented category compared to the other two categories in the beverage, alcohol business. Therefore, I am not even sure to talk of being a leader in this and that is even particularly relevant. We take a look at our products. We take a look at the competition. We take a look at the categories. We see what\u2019s happening. And we decide what we are going to do. Over the last few years, there hasn\u2019t been much pricing in the wine business period. We are seeing some opportunities for pricing as we move into our fiscal \u201815 and we are going to take those opportunities that we think that they are in the high end and the lower end. So that\u2019s where we are going to focus in terms of that element of our strategy. So it\u2019s really as simple as that. I don\u2019t think leader or follower makes a lot of sense in terms of even the discussion in this particular context. But yes, we look around, we see what\u2019s going in the marketplace and we make our judgments in that regard.", "Bryan Hunt - Wells Fargo Securities", "And with regards to magnitude, is there any comments around that you feel to make?", "Rob Sands", "No. I mean, we are really developing our plans and our strategies for taking the pricing in the areas that we are going to take it and they are not fully baked at this time. So it\u2019s really kind of hard to discuss the absolute magnitude of it at this moment.", "Bryan Hunt - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. And then my other question is when you look at the supply contracts across your businesses with the new beer business and the scale it brings to the company, you mentioned you haven\u2019t worked on glass contracts yet and that\u2019s an opportunity going forward, have you looked at any other supply contracts and has progress been made in kind of garnering savings given the new scale of the business?", "Bob Ryder", "Yes, number one, we didn\u2019t say we haven\u2019t or if we did say, we said it incorrectly. We have been working on glass and we have been working on other commodities. We are not at a stage yet where we are prepared to say exactly what our strategy is on glass. But it is something that we are working on. And yes we are working on the other commodities as well. And I would say the most we are prepared to say at the current time is I think that where we end up on commodities is going to be favorable.", "Bryan Hunt - Wells Fargo Securities", "And should we expect to see those (resources) this year?", "Bob Ryder", "That\u2019s what we think.", "Bryan Hunt - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay, right and should we expect to see those from a timeline perspective this year or is that\u2026?", "Bob Ryder", "Sure. We will have something to say. I am sure we will have something to say on commodities as we go out, go through the year. Yes.", "Bryan Hunt - Wells Fargo Securities", "Alright, I appreciate your time. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.", "Bob Ryder", "Hi, Bryan.", "Bryan Spillane - Bank of America", "Hi, thanks for taking the follow-up. So I am just going to give you a couple of quick kind of questions, some housekeeping items and then just one related to wine pricing. First just Bob if you could talk about just what the cash tax rate was for the year and what you expect it to be next year?", "Bob Ryder", "Yes, so the cash tax rate for the year is kind of anomalous, so let me kind of walk you through. What we have said, we haven\u2019t updated this guidance in a while, but we would expect a cash tax rate like the mid 20% on an ongoing basis. I would say that the beer structure will probably improve on that over the medium to long-term, and we will update you on that when things settle down. I would say that fiscal \u201814 and actually fiscal \u201815 as well are going to be pretty anomalous because of the big increase in the stock price and some option exercises from options that were expiring, etcetera or people that are just exercising some in the money, we get a tax deduction for that and that\u2019s actually a reasonably big number, right. If you look at the cash flow statement, you can see the cash we brought in from option exercises. So that will bring the cash tax rate down, relatively dramatically while this situation goes on. We don\u2019t expect it to last big time past fiscal \u201815. So I would call that not really an operating cash tax environment. It\u2019s just that \u2013 the anomalous equity activity.", "Bryan Spillane - Bank of America", "But it will be a little better. It will be favorable in \u201815 relative to sort of what your normal run rate ought to be going forward?", "Bob Ryder", "Yes, I would agree with that.", "Bryan Spillane - Bank of America", "Okay, foreign exchange, just the peso-dollar exchange rate, and what \u2013 how should we think about that from a transaction translation impact for next year, or this year I should say?", "Rob Sands", "Sorry, go ahead and finish your question.", "Bryan Spillane - Bank of America", "I was going to say for \u201815.", "Bob Ryder", "Yes. So the way we handle this and actually \u2013 and we told you this on previous calls, the peso-dollar rate was more favorable than we thought because actually the rate physically has gotten favorable from when we closed the deal. We do hedge transaction exposure to the peso. There isn\u2019t actually as much peso exposure as you would think, because most of the commodities in the beer industry are dollar-based. So, really the core peso exposure is our onsite labor at the facility which still is a sizable number, but nowhere near what you would think. And we do have hedge contracts, we go out two or three years on those and we are actually relatively hedged for fiscal \u201815, right. So \u2013 and as I recall that I haven\u2019t looked at it in a while, but I think the peso dollar is around 13, right. So, we monitor closely and lay on hedges when they get more favorable, but we are not expecting a ton of volatility there in fiscal \u201815.", "Bryan Spillane - Bank of America", "Okay. And then gross margins for the beer business in the fourth quarter and the full year, I know I think you disclosed that in the last couple of calls, are you going to \u2013 do you have that figure?", "Bob Ryder", "Yes, I think I had it in my script. I think it said it was 44%.", "Bryan Spillane - Bank of America", "Okay, alright. I must have missed it, sorry about that. And then just the last one\u2026", "Bob Ryder", "Please Bryan, I am exhausted man, come on.", "Bryan Spillane - Bank of America", "It\u2019s the lightning round.", "Bob Ryder", "Exactly.", "Bryan Spillane - Bank of America", "The last one is just the wine pricing, Rob, if could you just characterize the decision to raise prices in wine both low end and in your premium wines, is it a function of your sort of assessment of the market, especially at the low end, where there has been quite a bit of pricing the last couple of years and so you feel comfortable with the pricing dynamic or the competitive activity sort of make you feel comfortable about taking prices up, is it a \u2013 or is it a question or a function of kind of now that you have made some marketing investments, new products investments you feel more comfortable raising prices behind that or is it have some effect on what you think sort of commodity cost or raw material cost might be in the future? Just trying to understand the motivation to take prices?", "Rob Sands", "So yes, yes and no.", "Bryan Spillane - Bank of America", "Okay.", "Rob Sands", "So, yes, our assessment of the marketplace and so on and so forth is the fact that we do feel pretty well positioned given our previous investments and where we are relative to momentum in brand health that the timing is right and it\u2019s no, it\u2019s really not related to commodity, not related to commodity cost, although from a commodity cost perspective just kind of the opposite we have. We are not facing any particular headwinds this year in wine. So we are not expecting much inflation in cost of goods sold.", "Bryan Spillane - Bank of America", "Okay.", "Rob Sands", "So that will be helpful to us from a bottom line perspective.", "Bryan Spillane - Bank of America", "Alright, thank you very much and thanks for being so generous with your time.", "Rob Sands", "Our pleasure.", "Operator", "Thank you. That concludes the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call. I will now return the call to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks.", "Rob Sands", "Okay. Well, thanks for joining our call today. As Bob mentioned, the beer deal has been a real game-changer for us and the team plans to capitalize on the tremendous momentum that we have underway to continue to drive the growth, enhance financial performance of the business. As Bob said, we now expect the beer business to exceed our original expectations from a return on invested capital point of view. And I believe that our plans for fiscal 2015 prove that we have not wavered from our overarching strategic goal of generating profitable organic growth across all of our businesses, including our wine and spirits businesses. We have recently posted two videos on our website that provides nice views of the Nava brewery. I encourage you to take a look when you have a few moments.

(Operator Instructions) Thank you.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Patty Yahn-Urlaub", "Thanks, Jackie. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Constellation\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2015 conference call. I am here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer.", "This call complements our news release which has also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable, organic and constant-currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company\u2019s website at www.cbrands.com under the Investors section in Financial History.", "Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company\u2019s estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation\u2019s SEC filings.", "And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rob.", "Rob Sands", "Thanks, Patty and good morning to everyone. Welcome to our discussion of Constellation\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2015 sales and earnings results, which reflect a great start to our new fiscal year. Our beer business is on fire. Our wine and spirits business is on track to meet its goals for the year. And we continued to progress as planned with our Mexican brewery expansion. We have recently celebrated the one year anniversary of our game changing beer acquisition and I believe that our strong financial and operational performance during this time is a living testament to the significant contributions that our beer business is making to our overall sales profit and cash flow results.", "In the first quarter, the beer segment generated results that were better than our expectations for both the commercial business and our brewery in Mexico. Beer net sales increased double-digits to 14%, which represents a significant outperformance of the import category and the overall U.S. beer market. We continue to experience robust consumer demand for our iconic portfolio of Mexican beers, which is being driven by a combination of strong sales execution and excellent support from our wholesalers. The introduction of creative new marketing and advertising programs, which are resonating with consumers, continued distribution gains across the portfolio and the further expansion of new product offerings like Modelo Especial Chelada and Corona Light draft, which continued to exceed our initial growth forecast.", "Overall, the strong results that the beer business achieved in the first quarter are the primary driver of the upward revision to Constellation\u2019s overall EPS guidance for fiscal 2015. As such, we now expect beer depletions in fiscal 2015 to increase high single-digits, which should drive sales growth in the 10% range with underlying operating profits for the beer segment expected to increase in the mid-teen range. At this time, we believe we will have adequate supply to meet these sales goals for the year.", "I would like to remind everyone that the five core brands within the Constellation beer portfolio are ranked in the top 15 U.S. imported beer brands. Now, Corona Extra is the only top five U.S. beer brands in IRI channels that posted dollar share growth during the first quarter. In addition, the brand grew depletions of more than 3% and accounted for 10% of U.S. beer category dollar growth. As you know, Corona Light is the number one imported light brand in the U.S. with a 55% IRI dollar share of the import light category and increased dollar share by almost 2 share points during the quarter.", "Modelo Especial recently achieved yet another milestone as it moved up into the number two slot as the second largest imported U.S. beer brand on a volume basis in IRI channels, while also gaining distribution and 40 basis points of dollar share during the first quarter. And Pacifico and Negra Modelo each grew IRI dollar sales in the high single-digit range during the first quarter. While draft currently represents a small part of our overall volume, depletions grew more than 35% for this format driven by the market expansion of Corona Light in the first quarter.", "As we approach the Cinco de Mayo holiday, we continued to build our Corona de Mayo equity to assert Corona\u2019s ownership over summer\u2019s first fiesta in an effort to maintain momentum and keep Corona top of mind with consumers and our wholesalers as we kicked off a 120 Days of Summer. During the first quarter, initiatives included the national TV debut of the new Corona Extra 2014 television spots for general market and Hispanic consumers, the introduction of the Fill your Summer program, which is our first ever multicultural, bilingual summer program consisting of 18 weekly themes with activities, new contents and prize drawings.", "Promotional, digital and radio advertising and digital video sponsorships launched leading into key occasions, including the World Cup and ESPN coverage of the NFL draft. The national TV advertising for Corona Light designed for sports and cable entertainment TV debuted in the first quarter for the key summer selling season. New ads for Modelo Especial\u2019s Hispanic Real World campaign were introduced using general market media and strong support in targeted Spanish language TV and digital video programming.", "The Modelo Especial summer soccer promotion kicked off in May featuring a summer promotion that includes a sweepstakes and a campaign designed to engage consumers at all touch points. A national launch of Modelo Especial Chelada began in April, expanding outside of initial introductory states. This initiative is supported by Spanish language TV ads on national Spanish networks, consumer sampling at retail, PR in key markets, social media engagements and C-store print trade ads.", "Now, from a brewery and operational perspective, all areas of brewery expansion including a new brewhouse, packaging area and warehouse are well underway. In many areas, crews are working around the clock. And as of last week over 1,200 craftsmen and construction workers were onsite. The first six fermentation tanks were recently hoisted into place and the massive concrete pour for the high density warehouse is progressing quickly. Great care is being taken so that construction work does not disrupt existing brewery operations. In fact their brewery produced a record number of cases in May. We continue to work diligently to finalize our future plans for commodity sourcing on items such as glass as well as assessing options for longer term capacity expansion beyond the 20 million hectoliter expansion that is already underway at the Nava brewery. We will certainly inform you as soon as these plans have been finalized.", "From a wine and spirits perspective during the first quarter the business performed generally as expected with sales results impacted by the planned distributor inventory destocking. The agreed upon make whole payment associated with this activity benefited gross profit margins for the quarter. First quarter wine and spirits depletions were a bit muted following a strong finish to our fiscal year in February when we posted depletion trends of more than 5%. In addition, quarterly depletions were impacted by some retail inventory destocking.", "Our expectation is that you should see improving depletion trends as we progress through the year similar to last year. Overall, we remained committed to growing in line with the U.S. wine and spirits industry growth for fiscal 2015 and beyond. As such during the first quarter we gained market share in IRI channels and experienced excellent performance for a number of our Focus Brands including Mark West, Kim Crawford, Ruffino, Black Box, Rex Goliath and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi.", "As outlined earlier this year one of key strategic objectives for the year is to focus our marketing efforts on a subset of our Focus Brands in order to drive key brands that have scale, higher margin and the greatest growth potential. Some of the initiatives recently executed that support this goal include the following. Increased TV advertising for specific Focus Brands including Woodbridge, Black Box and Robert Mondavi private selection, enhanced digital and print advertising as well as in-store programming for key brands like Clos du Bois Rouge and Estancia. And finally Dreaming Tree 360 degree activation programs that have begun in conjunction with Dave Matthews\u2019 summer concert tour.", "We are reaping the benefits of some of these key marketing and promotional initiatives as we continued to be recognized by industry leading publications for our new products and our Focus Brands. The most recent noteworthy accolades include the following. Earlier this week the drinks business and intangible business published their 2014 power brands lists Robert Mondavi was named the number three most powerful brand in the world, moving up from the number four spot last year.", "The Beverage Information Group recently announced their 2014 growth brand award winners with 13 Constellation brands receiving awards, including Kim Crawford, The Dreaming Tree, Mark West, Black Box, Estancia, Ruffino, Woodbridge, SVEDKA and Rex Goliath. In the April issue of Wines and Spirits magazine the 2011 Robert Mondavi, Napa Valley, Pinot Noir received 92 point score and the Best Buy designation, it was also included in the year\u2019s best Pinot Noir feature. Constellation Wines claimed four spots in this year\u2019s wine and spirits restaurant top 50 list, which is the survey of top-selling wines at America\u2019s favorite restaurants and included Franciscan, Simi, Robert Mondavi and Ruffino.", "And one of our other key strategic initiatives for the year relates to our drive to deliver margin accretive innovation and new products. Some of the recent activities that we have underway include the national expansion of wine on tap which includes varietals from brands like Simi, Franciscan, Mark West and Clos du Bois. The line extension introductions of the (indiscernible) Red Blend, Rex Goliath Sangria and Black Box Pinot Noir, the launch of Arbor Mist Sangria Rita, which capitalizes on the growing popularity of spirit style sangria and margarita cocktails and after a successful trial period at a major retail chain, PopCrush is expanding into national distribution.", "As we have previously discussed, we also continue to look for opportunities to leverage our sales and marketing efforts across our beer and wine and spirits businesses. One of our new initiatives includes the Corona and Rosatello brands, which have teamed up to develop a joint bilingual point-of-sale creative platform and consumer offer to drive display during the key summer selling season targeting California general market and Hispanic chains and independent retailers.", "Now, from a spirits perspective, while spirits net sales declined in the first quarter due to the timing of shipments, depletions grew in the low single-digit range. During the quarter, we launched SVEDKA Mango, Pineapple and Strawberry Lemonade as additions to SVEDKA\u2019s flavor lineup as we continued to capitalize on the growth of flavored vodka. This activity is being supported by digital and billboard advertising and is being well received in the marketplace. We also reintroduced the new SVEDKA Stars & Stripes in advance of the Memorial Day holiday, which has become a very popular consumer item.", "In closing, solid execution of first quarter results demonstrates that we continue to deliver on our key strategic imperatives across our beer and wine and spirits businesses. And I am excited about our prospects for the business for the remainder of the year.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our first quarter business results.", "Bob Ryder", "Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Our comparable basis diluted EPS in Q1 came in at $1.07, which represents a sizable increase versus last year. Q1 included some expected material activities in both of our businesses. In beer, we continue to realize the tremendous accretion attributable to the Q2 fiscal \u201814 beer business acquisition, which has significantly enhanced our financial and strategic profile. Sticking to beer, our Q1 financial performance and continued robust marketplace momentum drove the upward revision to our fiscal 2015 EPS guidance.", "Turning to wine and spirits, sales were impacted by our previously announced distributor inventory reduction. Also as announced, this reduction did not impact EBIT as demonstrated by the strong Q1 segment EBIT growth. Some of this growth is timing related and we expect a good portion of this favorability to reverse in Q2. Our full year financial sales and EBIT goals for wine and spirits remain on track.", "Given those brief highlights, let\u2019s look at Q1 performance in more detail, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. As you can see from our news release, consolidated net sales for Q1 included $868 million of incremental net sales related to the beer business acquisition as we consolidated 100% of beer sales as of the June 7, 2013 acquisition date. For Q1, beer segment net sales increased 14% on volume growth of 11%. Depletions were also very strong growing 8%. It\u2019s typical to see distributor inventory build during our first quarter as we head into our strongest selling period for the year in beer.", "Wine and spirits net sales on a constant currency basis decreased 1%. This reflected a shipment volume decrease of 4% primarily resulting from a planned distributor inventory destocking partially offset by a make whole payment from the distributor associated with the destocking as well as favorable product mix. For the quarter, consolidated gross profit increased $420 million and our consolidated gross margin was 44% versus 38% for the prior year first quarter. Incremental gross profit from the consolidation of beer was $410 million. This produced a beer segment gross margin of 47%. The increase in our consolidated gross margin primarily reflects the benefit from the consolidation of the higher margin beer business, the distributor payment associated with the inventory reduction and favorable wine and spirit product mix.", "SG&A for the quarter increased $119 million. The incremental SG&A associated with consolidating the beer business was $123 million, the majority of which is marketing. This was offset by lower wine and spirits SG&A which was primarily driven by timing of compensation related expense. Q1 consolidated operating income increased $301 million. $288 million of the increase was related to the consolidation of the beer results with the beer segment generating an operating margin of 33% for the quarter. The inclusion of the beer business results was the primary driver behind the 11 percentage point improvement in our consolidated operating margin for the quarter.", "Wine and spirits also contributed to the margin favorability as this segment reported a three percentage point improvement in operating margin due to the factors mentioned earlier. Roughly speaking the distributor make whole payment, positive operating \u2013 positive product mix and the timing of SG&A contributed equal thirds to the operating margin upside. Due to the timing of the beer business acquisition we did not record \u2013 recognize any equity earnings from Crown during the first quarter. For the prior year first quarter equity earnings for Crown totaled $66 million. Interest expense for the quarter was $86 million, up 58% versus Q1 last year. The increase represents an increase in average borrowings as a result of the acquisition funding partially offset by lower average interest rates. That provides a good spot to discuss our debt position.", "At the end of May, our total debt was $7.2 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $6.8 billion, a decrease of $140 million since the end of fiscal 2014. The decrease primarily reflects our free cash flow generation. In early June we made $558 million post closing purchase price adjustment payment for the beer transaction. This was funded through a combination of cash on hand and revolving credit facilities. I would also like to remind you that we have $500 million 8.38 senior note coming due in December. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 32.5%, which reflects the benefits from integrating the beer business and compares to a 36.2% rate for Q1 last year. We still anticipate our full year tax rate to approximate 30%.", "Now, let\u2019s discuss free cash flow which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending. For the first quarter we generated $101 million of free cash flow compared to a use of cash of $19 million for Q1 last year. Operating cash flow for the quarter totaled $232 million versus $3 million last year. The increase was primarily due to the incremental benefits from the beer business acquisition. CapEx for the quarter totaled $131 million compared to $22 million last year. CapEx for the beer segment totaled $85 million as brewery expansion activities continued to progress.", "For fiscal \u201815, we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $425 million to $500 million. This reflects operating cash flow that is targeted to reach at least $1 billion as we continue to realize earnings benefits from the beer business transaction. And CapEx, that\u2019s projected in the range of $575 million to $625 million. As a reminder, our CapEx projection includes $450 million to $500 million for the beer business primarily related to expanding the brewery to 20 million hectoliters of capacity.", "Now, let\u2019s move to our full year fiscal 2015 outlook. As a result of the strong beer business performance, we are now forecasting comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.10 to $4.25 per share versus our previous guidance of $3.95 to $4.15. For fiscal 2015, we are now targeting net sales growth for the beer segment to approximate 10%. Shipment and depletion volumes are now targeted to grow high single-digits and significantly outpaced the import category and the total beer industry.", "For fiscal 2015, we expect beer segment operating income to grow in the range of 25% to 30%. As a reminder, our fiscal 2014 beer segment operating income totaled $773 million and included 100% of the U.S. beer commercial business operating income for the entire year and brewery profits from the date of the beer business acquisition. When factoring an estimated full year of brewery profit for fiscal 2014, underlying operating income growth for the beer segment is expected to be in the mid-teens range.", "From a beer gating perspective, I would like to note that in Q2, we faced an easier comparison as shipment volume growth in Q2 last year was only 1%. Beer will be facing some more difficult comparisons in the second half of this year as shipment volume growth in the second half of last year was over 13%. For wine and spirits, we continue to target net sales and EBIT growth for fiscal \u201815 to be in the low to mid single-digit range. As mentioned earlier, we expect some of the EBIT favorability in Q1 for wine to reverse in Q2 due to the timing of shipment activity.", "Our comparable basis guidance, excludes unusual items, which are detailed on the last page of the release. Before we take your questions, I would like to note that we are off to a great start in fiscal 2015 as the beer business continues to generate strong marketplace and financial performance, the brewery expansion continues to progress and the wine and spirit business is on track to meet its goals for the year.", "With that, we are happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC.", "Nik Modi - RBC", "Yes, good morning everyone.", "Bob Ryder", "Hey, Nik.", "Rob Sands", "Hi, Nik.", "Nik Modi - RBC", "Hey, so just two quick questions. On the wine price mix, can you just kind of explain was that all mix or is there any bit of pricing in there? And then just generally what\u2019s going on within the pricing environment within wine? And then the last question I guess this one is for you, Rob, given beer margins have been kind of in the 33% range the last couple of quarters, this is a seasonally high quarter in terms of expenses, just curious on kind of state of the union on the 30% to 35% target and kind of what you think about perhaps being at the upper end of that or even above that range over the next couple of years? Thanks.", "Bob Ryder", "Sure. Let me just comment on price mix smaller and then I will let Rob do the industry, what\u2019s going on in the industry. So, for us for the quarter, I\u2019d say that the upside to margin was primarily mix. Pricing didn\u2019t have a big impact. I will let Rob talk about what\u2019s going on in pricing in general in the wine and spirits category.", "Rob Sands", "Yes, I think we see \u2013 Nik, we see some pricing now occurring in wine and spirits. Still I would say in line primarily we see pricing in the lower end of the wine business and we see some pricing in the higher end. The middle remains I would say pretty competitive, so sort of that $8 to $15 range is where we still don\u2019t see a lot of pricing. But I would say as a general proposition the pricing environment in wine and spirits is a bit more favorable than it has been in the past. We have taken some pricing on select brands as Bob said the margin accretion in the first quarter is probably more due to mix than it is to pricing, but we do have some pricing on some of our larger brands especially in the premium category and in sub-premium and sparkling. So as I said generally a more favorable environment.", "Bob Ryder", "Sure. Nik on the second, the beer margin question, so as you know, we just updated our guidance. We are expecting this year to have margin expansion in beer as the guidance reflects about 10% sales growth and mid-teens EBIT growth, right. So we expect the beer business to continue gaining margin. Last year for the three quarters that we owned the business, our operating profit margin was around 31%. This year we expect that to be around 32% right now. So we do see some expanding margins.", "Now your question was more along longer-term because we gave some guidance that when the brewery is completed that we should have margins in kind of a low to mid 30% range. And we have stuck with that guidance and there is still obviously a lot going on in the beer business that the breweries being build out as Rob said there is about 1,200 people on the ground down there going up to about 3,000 building out to 20 million hectoliters and we still are buying 40% of our finished goods from Anheuser-Busch and all of our raw materials from Anheuser-Busch. And as we said we are currently thinking about transitioning from Anheuser-Busch for the raw material perspective and we have some bids coming in from the global providers of glass, hops, barley, things like that. And most likely we will be discussing the transition from the Anheuser-Busch and how those bids came out in a general frame probably in this calendar year.", "So I think when that flushes out we might be able to give some more specific guidance about where we see longer term margins in beer. But we still don't have all those bids in, and we are not ready to talk about it to the outside world. Obviously, the big component of that is glass which we also aren\u2019t ready to talk about it to the outside world. There is a lot of discussions going in that arena. So long answer to right now we are still sticking to the low to mid single-digit operating profit margin for beer.", "Nik Modi - RBC", "Alright. Thanks Bob.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of from the line of Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.", "Alice Longley - Buckingham Research", "Hi, good morning. Can you hear me?", "Rob Sands", "Yes. Hi Alice.", "Alice Longley - Buckingham Research", "Hi. Okay. So my question is a little bit more on the second quarter beer shipments and depletions, should I assume that shipments are up a little less or little weaker than depletions in the second quarter because you over shipped a little in the first quarter. And then the second part of that is what should we be looking for depletions in the second quarter, you talked about the easy comp and also we have got the World Cup and we have got weather that really just turned favorable over the Memorial Day weekend, so can you kind of go through that and breakout depletions in the second quarter and then shipments versus those? Thank you.", "Rob Sands", "Yes. We try not to get too specific on quarterly guidance and my gosh, you are asking very specific question, but that\u2019s okay. We do expect a very strong second quarter in beer for two reasons. We do have a lot of momentum in the marketplace as you see. And from a billings perspective, we have an easier overlap, I think it might be our easiest overlap of the year as I recall from last year, depletions were stronger than shipments last year. So, I think the depletion overlap is a little more difficult than the shipment overlap. But for the full year, we still expect shipments and depletions to be aligned for the beer business and there is a lot of this quarterly activity going on, but I would probably try to focus more on what\u2019s going on in the longer term and over the full year.", "Alice Longley - Buckingham Research", "I mean, is it likely that the second quarter depletions in volume terms will be similar to the first quarter?", "Bob Ryder", "That\u2019s about all I am going to say about the quarterly guidance.", "Alice Longley - Buckingham Research", "Okay. Then just I guess I will add one more question, if you look at your beer shipments in the first quarter, price looks like it was about 3%, it was 3.5% and yet I think we have been working with 2% for pricing for beer and I think your guidance for the year sort of assumes 2% pricing. So, can you comment on that 3%?", "Bob Ryder", "Sure. In that number, Alice, is also some distributor \u2013 beer distributor contribution to some of our marketing campaigns, because we will sit down every year with the distributors. And if we have some ideas that we think are really going to drive volume and then the distributors agree that they will sometimes, they will contribute and that contribution comes across in the net sales what looks like pricing, but it\u2019s really not because that it\u2019s a zero some gain that comes into an expense that\u2019s further down on the P&L. So, I think from a pricing perspective, IRI just from price probably closer to like 2% versus 3%.", "Alice Longley - Buckingham Research", "Excellent, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.", "Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Hey, good morning. I have got two questions relative to wine. I guess the first one maybe following up on Nik Modi\u2019s question about the price mix on wine, I think Bob, if you could just walk us through net sales on a constant currency basis for the wine and spirits segment was down 1% and our wine shipment volumes were down 3.8%. So, explaining that, I think that gap makes it look like there is more price mix maybe in wine, but I am assuming that the make whole payment is contributing to that. So, could you just sort of try to give us some sense for how much the make whole payment contributed? I think in total, it looks like it could be somewhere in the $15 million range, I am just trying to get a sense for the size of that? And then I have a second question.", "Bob Ryder", "Yes. The make whole payment and you guys understand the math of it, right, so we are getting a payment against which there were no sales, right. So that really helps your margin. And for the quarter, the impact on math was probably between 75 and 100 bps for the quarter would be the impact on gross profit margin for that.", "Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "But on the revenue growth, what would it be \u2013 so it would have been the same dollar amount on the revenues, seems like it\u2019s a credit that comes to the net sales line right?", "Bob Ryder", "Yes, that is correct. It is a credit that comes through the net sales line, but it really \u2013 it\u2019s not based on revenue, it\u2019s based on EBIT, right.", "Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Right.", "Bob Ryder", "So it kind of brings down your net selling price per case, but it increases your gross profit margin, right. So, it\u2019s really \u2013 it\u2019s quasi-confusing, but what I will tell you is for the quarter, mix had a bigger impact than the make whole payment.", "Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Got it.", "Bob Ryder", "It is a very positive mix quarter versus prior year and I will tell you prior year was a very poor mix quarter.", "Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "That\u2019s helpful. And then the second question just related to wine, Rob, there has been some speculation in the press about Treasury Wine Estates and the potential that it might be for sale and Constellation has been mentioned in that. And I obviously don\u2019t expect you to comment directly on that, but just conceptually kind of where you\u2019ve got, where you are thinking at this point in terms of M&A in wine and is it tuck-in, would you be open to doing something sort of more transformational, any comments around that would be helpful? Thanks.", "Rob Sands", "Yes. I mean, I think that as it relates to M&A, whether in wine or any other categories, our position remains the same, which is as to use of capital, our primary focus remains on debt pay down at the current time. As you mentioned, tuck-in deals meaning if a brand came around that, that was something that was really hot met our financial objectives, filled the niche that we didn\u2019t have. Of course, we would take a look at an opportunity like that, but generally, our strategy at the current time is all about driving organic growth and obviously we have got really good organic growth across all of the categories in the business. And there is a lot of upside and benefit to be gained through simple debt reduction following the beer acquisition. So, strategically, that\u2019s what really makes the most sense in terms of how we are operating the business at the current time.", "Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Alright, thank you. Have a great holiday.", "Rob Sands", "Thanks. You too.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.", "Rob Sands", "Hi, Bill.", "Bill Chappell - SunTrust", "Good morning. Just one last one on the wine side, any kind of update on grape or input costs, maybe was there incremental inflation this quarter and are you still expecting kind of some relief as we move to the fall?", "Bob Ryder", "Yes. The grape input costs for this fiscal year we are not going to see much inflation from that at all, because the higher cost grapes have pretty much flushed through the P&L. So, that\u2019s helping our wine EBIT growth for the year and helping us maintain the guidance of kind of flattish margins for the year.", "Bill Chappell - SunTrust", "So, as we look out I mean could the tailwind get bigger as we move to the back half of the year?", "Bob Ryder", "No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to change that much. I don\u2019t think we will see a lot of noise in grape costs for the year. It\u2019s relatively flat.", "Bill Chappell - SunTrust", "Okay. And then just on the tax, just to make sure, are you expecting it to be below 30% for one or all the quarters from here that you have to get back to that 30% for the full year?", "Bob Ryder", "Yes, it will have to be below for some of them, just the math of it, right, because we are at like 32.5% this year. So, we are still sticking with the 30% for the full year, which would mean one or several quarters we will have to be below the 30%.", "Bill Chappell - SunTrust", "Okay. So, but not just like a single quarter catch up, it will just be kind of even over the next three?", "Bob Ryder", "It\u2019s \u2013 you can\u2019t really forecast it, because it\u2019s based on a lot of it\u2019s based on actions of third parties and we are not sure when the timing of it will happen.", "Bill Chappell - SunTrust", "Okay. And then last can you just kind of walk us through if we look at the Nava plant, I mean, things that are being done to \u2013 as the margins are ramping up kind of in front of the expansion, what\u2019s helping to drive it beyond mix? I mean, what\u2019s \u2013 what can you do, what have you done with the plant since you have taken ownership that\u2019s kind of gives us excitement for the margins to expand between now and the finalization of the expansion?", "Bob Ryder", "The expansion is going to be kind of a date specific thing, right and the thing that will drive the margin increase on the expansion, when the expansion is done, it\u2019s primarily freight. Okay, because right now, we are buying 40% of our goods from InBev and they are being sourced from hundreds of miles south of brewery, right. So we make them at the brewery, we\u2019ll have much lower freight, but then there is a lot of other moving parts like I mentioned earlier to Nik\u2019s question what\u2019s going to happen when we move to our own purchasing contracts versus buying from InBev, is that positive, negative or neutral? What\u2019s going to happen around glass, which of course is the big input cost in beer, packaging is roughly 50% at cost of sales. In beer, what we had experienced so far is an incredibly well run brewery. The people and the process that we inherited when we bought the Nava brewery we couldn\u2019t be happier with. I was just down there a week ago and the throughput on the brewery has surprised us on a positive perspective especially when you consider all of the stuff that\u2019s going on to double the size of the brewery, right. So that helped us, it was good because first quarter is one of the peak production quarters like you are trying to make as much as you can to fuel the peak summer selling season.", "Bill Chappell - SunTrust", "Got it. Okay. Well, thanks for the color.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Hi. Good morning guys.", "Rob Sands", "Hi Mark.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "I guess two questions also beer related. Rob can you give us a little more perspective on specifically what\u2019s driving the incremental growth you are seeing with Especial and to what extent you are seeing ACV gains and to what extent it\u2019s coming from improvements in shelf space or velocity at existing accounts? And then I had a related beer question.", "Rob Sands", "Yes, Mark. I mean it\u2019s a whole bunch of things. I mean it starts with the consumer and the consumer is voting with their feet. So, we had very strong consumer takeaway on the product and everything we are doing from a marketing perspective as it relates to the consumer is obviously really resonating with the consumer. And we go back to retail and wholesale and you get sort of a compounding infectiousness when you have a brand that\u2019s on fire with the consumer which really means that it\u2019s a mushrooming effect, right. And it\u2019s a cart and a horse question, in that the consumer is that the \u2013 the product resonates with the consumer, the consumer is demanding the product, the retailers sees that it\u2019s hot with the consumer. The retailer and the wholesaler then invests more resources whether it\u2019s manpower or dollars against the product which then circles back around and has the effect of even driving the products harder at retail.", "So fundamentally you sort of got the whole cycle working to the advantage of the brand. So it\u2019s really a whole combination effects that people got very strong marketing behind the brand as well as our other beer brands. And again that continues to resonate with the consumer. We are sending a very consistent message whether it\u2019s on Corona or Modelo Especial. Modelo Especial is a very, very well known brand in Mexico, therefore it is a brand that is well known and trusted by the Hispanic consumer in the United States that population demographic group is very strong in terms of purchasing power and growth at the current time. So, we are seeing all the benefits of that.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "That\u2019s for the ACV and same-store, is there \u2013 can you give us any perspective geographically on Especial at (indiscernible) with Hispanics and it\u2019s growing I think kind of across the country but can you give us some perspective on comparative rates of growth geographically?", "Rob Sands", "Yes. We are actually seeing very strong growth in some of the most mature markets for Modelo Especial like Southern California where Modelo Especial has a share and its equal to or greater than Corona and we are continuing to see double-digit growth in some of these large markets. And then in some of the more developmental markets like in the East and so on and so forth, we are continuing to see the brand really starting to catch on and we are seeing strong growth in those markets too. So it\u2019s really across the board phenomenon and even in the mature markets we are seeing double-digit growth.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "That\u2019s great. And then I was hoping you could unpack this comment about having adequate supply for your demand this summer? And there is a lot out there in terms of how much there is a glass shortage and who it affects and how, but can you just kind of set the record straight, is there some depletion number in terms of rate of growth? Will you start having problems with glass supply or are you sitting here looking at the next three months and saying it\u2019s kind of a non-issue?", "Rob Sands", "Yes, it\u2019s the latter. We are looking at the next three months and it\u2019s a non-issue. First of all on supply, what has occurred, there\u2019s been some very isolated circumstances on SKUs, not on brands, but on some particular SKUs in some markets we have seen some supply tightness in the marketplace. What\u2019s really driven that has nothing to do with anything related to the brewery or ABI or supply in general, it\u2019s merely a consequence of the fact that the brands are growing at a rate, which intrinsically it can be hard to keep up with. Therefore, in a particular market like there was some reports on Florida, there was some supply shortages there on a particular SKU, well, Publix is a gigantic chain down there, ran a great big promotion and ran itself and everybody else out of inventory, that would happen or can happen under any circumstances when you are talking about the kind of growth that we are experiencing at the current moment in time. It\u2019s frankly just difficult to supply and can be at the levels that we are talking about.", "Now, all that said, we think we have got the inventories within our own business at wholesale and at retail generally speaking that there should not be supply issues even with the growth that we are experiencing throughout the rest of the summer and of course we are planning for this growth. Now, as I said, on an individual SKU basis in an individual market depending on what promotions are being run by the retailers, which we don\u2019t necessarily have control over can something like that occur, yes, but we are not expecting anything of out of the ordinary in that respect. So, the supply situation is well in hand. We do not have a glass shortage. I don\u2019t know where that comes from either. We have got as a general proposition plenty of glass to supply the brand. And as I mentioned in my script, we are working on the glass strategy and we should be able to talk about that in the next few months. And I am sure we will see a favorable outcome there as well, so.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Great, great. Thanks very much, Rob.", "Rob Sands", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA.", "Rob Sands", "Hi, Caroline.", "Caroline Levy - CLSA", "Everyone, good morning. Congrats on the great results.", "Rob Sands", "Thanks.", "Caroline Levy - CLSA", "I was looking for some help with modeling the third quarter, because you had \u2013 I guess, Bob you had mentioned that shipments were up 13%, I don\u2019t know I have a little more than that in my model in the third quarter a year ago, but it\u2019s looking like that could be a down shipment year on quarter, a down shipment quarter. And I am just wondering if that\u2019s how you are modeling it, you are looking at that comp and saying yes, we should expect very little shipment growth and then what the implications are for margins in that quarter, if that happens?", "Bob Ryder", "Yes. The statement I made was last year we experienced 13% growth in the back half. So that would have been Q3 and Q4 which were both strong quarters in beer last year, because they were subsequent to us becoming an independent beer company to the U.S. distributors. So, we have been saying that along we have much more difficult overlaps in beer in the back half and easier in the front half. And our easiest overlap in beer from a shipment perspective is the second quarter. Then when you look next year, Q3, Q4 were very strong for beer.", "Caroline Levy - CLSA", "But again, the implications on margins could also come through in the back half because of that, I mean, shipments and margins would be strongly correlated, I take it?", "Bob Ryder", "Yes, probably, but again from a full year perspective, right, what we are seeing is some pretty impressive numbers. We are saying we expect sales to be up about 10%. We are saying profits to be up almost 1.5 times that, right. So there will be margin expansion in any individual quarter. There can be anomalous activity and it\u2019s not as you know in every quarter you have anomalous activity in the previous year and the anomalous activity in the current year, so you can have some odd outcomes that\u2019s why I look \u2013 like to look at full year or even year-to-date as you get more data in your margin analysis. So that\u2019s how we see things playing out.", "Caroline Levy - CLSA", "Thank you. And then I just wanted to ask about A&M spending, I guess last year your ad spending was about $280 million, could you help us just quantify how much your spending is going up and if that\u2019s timed particularly on beer around summer, so most of it\u2019s going to happen before the back half?", "Rob Sands", "Yes. So marketing spend will go up this year versus last year. And in fact we expect it to be a higher percentage of sales as well. And we expect to spend most of it in the peak summer season. We are just spending a decent amount of marketing in the first quarter. And because as we have made a conscious efforts to kind of do our media flights around when the consumer is drinking a lot of beer, right in the summer. And as Rob discussed, we have put some money behind World Cup, put some money behind boxing and we put a decent amount of money to work against major league baseball. So, we do expect marketing to go up this year both in absolute dollars. And as a percentage of sales, I would say roughly speaking, we would expect to spend between 8% to 9% of sales on marketing for the full year.", "Caroline Levy - CLSA", "Thank you. One more question if I may on Corona Light, do you have any anecdotal actual numbers to share with us on how that push is going on premise and how the brand is doing in markets where you really to get that brewer activity?", "Rob Sands", "Yes. So we \u2013 as you said we have made a concerted effort to push Corona Light through the draft \u2013 through draft which through the on-premise and that\u2019s going very well. The consumer is really resonate with the product because it has much higher taste than other light beers, but still has the low alcohol, obviously they have recognized the brand and the retailers will ask pub owners really like it because it\u2019s a higher ring for them right, it\u2019s more expensive core than say a premium light. So that actually \u2013 that strategy is going as good or better than we anticipated. And it\u2019s probably not statistically valid yet, but we also feel that in the markets where we are driving Corona Light we also sell more cases of Corona Light. So we believe that that will go very well.", "Caroline Levy - CLSA", "Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with ISI.", "Rob Ottenstein - ISI", "Great. Thank you very much. As you look at your beer sales can you kind of breakout to the best you can where you see the surprise coming from, is it particular brands, SKUs, areas. And also do you have any data or any information from your guys suggesting where your share gains are coming from is it coming from mainstream light beers, premium beers, any particular brands or is it from some of the Heineken\u2019s Mexican beers, just kind of a sense of where the share gains are coming from please? And then as a follow-up perhaps you could address any plans you may be making now to address the planned launch of Montego yet later in the year?", "Rob Sands", "Yes. I would say Robert that we are really happy with our growth throughout the country. Now, what I will tell you is that we are doing better in the West Coast as Rob said Modelo Especial is doing a great job growing in markets where it\u2019s highly penetrated already. So our best geographies on a growth wise are the West and the South. But we are really happy with our growth around the country and we are pretty much gaining share in every space. I\u2019d say that every one of our brands is growing versus prior year. I\u2019d say that Corona, which is very well distributed, continues to grow quite nicely. In the first quarter, it put up some good numbers. Depletion growth was in the low single-digits. Shipment growth was higher than that, because we had that inventory replenishment. And Modelo Especial continues to grow in the mid single-digits. So, it\u2019s really all going quite well.", "Rob Ottenstein - ISI", "But is the growth coming from other imports like Heineken, is it coming from Coors, Miller, Bud, or is it kind of all of the above?", "Rob Sands", "Yes, Robert, this is Rob. I would say that it\u2019s really kind of across the board. It\u2019s kind of hard to say exactly where the share gains are being sourced from, but you can look at our growth and our brands versus pretty much any of the other categories within beer probably with the exception of craft. So, it\u2019s across the board sort of phenomena. And I\u2019d say that if you look at the industry overall, you\u2019ve got Constellation beer, right, which is about the same size as craft and you have got a craft of the whole category, which is about the same size as our beer business. And those two segments are I would say taking share just generally across the board.", "Rob Ottenstein - ISI", "That\u2019s very clear. And as you think about the expected launch of Montego this fall, anything that you are hearing about that and how are you thinking about preparing your brand strategy and marketing to combat that?", "Rob Sands", "So, I would say, a couple of things in that regard. First of all, there has been a lot of launches by a lot of companies over the years. And in the recent past and in the distant past of brands that were designed to compete with our portfolio, right.", "Rob Ottenstein - ISI", "Yes.", "Rob Sands", "You can think of brands like \u2013 you can remember all kinds of attempts. And again, our brands are extremely well established with the consumer. So, I would say we don\u2019t fear competition particularly. And we have seen examples of it many times and we just kind of stick to our knitting and drive our business the way we have been driving in the past which has been a particularly good strategy. Now as it relates to Montego, first of all, it\u2019s not an established brand in Mexico, it\u2019s not known to the Mexican or the Hispanic consumer, it\u2019s just another brand basically. So, it doesn\u2019t pose any particular threat to us that it\u2019s different than anything else that has been done by any of our competitors in the past. On another note much sort of like the clustered theory of fast food restaurants, why do they all build on the same corner, hopefully, if it experiences some success, it will expand the category for everybody. So, I think it could actually have a positive impact on driving sort of the whole Mexican import category should it be, should it gain any success at all. So, again, we are just not \u2013 we are not particularly fussed by one company introducing one brand that might theoretically compete with some of our brands. So, that\u2019s sort of the bottom line.", "Rob Ottenstein - ISI", "Great. And then just in terms of the upside to your expectations and original budgeting, is that more in Corona Extra and Modelo Especial and any particular SKUs just trying to get a sense where you are doing better than you had expected?", "Rob Sands", "Yes. Our business is a general proposition, which means all of our beer brands are growing at a faster rate than we would have predicted prior to the beginning of the year. And as I have said in the past this is with the kind of growth that we are experiencing it is difficult to predict if it\u2019s hard to make forecast and to give guidance and to remain reasonable given the market at the same time. So you got to balance all those things. We can\u2019t just make up crazy numbers, so we try to come up with what we think are reasonable numbers. And then in our own internal planning we also made sure that we plan for the contingency that the business will grow faster than we expect because it\u2019s really little downside in doing that. So don\u2019t confuse, our guidance and our forecasting and our attempt to be reasonable given sort of where the market is with what we are doing from a capacity perspective to ensure that we have sufficient supplies to meet market demand, so two different things.", "Rob Ottenstein - ISI", "Okay great. Thank you very much.", "Rob Sands", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan.", "Rob Sands", "Hi John.", "John Faucher - JPMorgan", "Good morning. Thank you. Just wanted to ask one quick question, well I guess two quick questions about the guidance. The first is if we look at the order of magnitude of the upside for this quarter not a whole lot extra flowing through, just any comments on that in terms of why the rest of the year maybe isn\u2019t going up a little bit more. And then a clarification on the free cash flow guidance which stated the same, is it simply that with the sales coming in better, higher receivables, higher inventories what have you \u2013 is it working capital that\u2019s offsetting the higher net income on the free cash flow guidance? Thanks.", "Rob Sands", "Yes. So I will let Bob answer the free cash flow. On the guidance for the year as Bob said a number of times second half of the year we are overlapping 13% growth I mean it\u2019s sort of simple as that. Again we are back to the point I was just previously making which is we can only sort of forecast reasonable numbers and our guidance is based on that and we have a pretty significant overlap in the second half of the year. And we had some pretty easy comps in the first half of the year. So yes, we grew 14% in sales in the first quarter and that was a good result and we are very pleased with that. And as Bob said we expect probably from a sales perspective a pretty strong second quarter because we had a very low sales month \u2013 quarter in the second quarter last year with 1% growth and then we overlapped the 13% growth in the second half of the year. So that\u2019s what it translates for the whole year into the low-single digit growth of sales that we have been \u2013 that is included in our guidance. So I would sort of like the fact that we can do at the current moment relative to our guidance for the year. But your crystal ball is as good as ours in many respects.", "Bob Ryder", "John on the free cash flow it\u2019s the first quarter alright and even if you flow through the after tax impacts of our increased if you call EBIT guidance, we are still within the range that we provided for the full year. So we feel it was worth readdressing it. And we will be readdressing it as the year goes on. But we thought it\u2019s only the first quarter, so let\u2019s see how the year comes out and we are still within the free cash flow range.", "John Faucher - JPMorgan", "Okay, thanks. And then one clarification that the wine benefit having you guys said that was 75 to 100 basis points and that\u2019s a total company gross margin is that right, that\u2019s how we should back into that number?", "Rob Sands", "It\u2019s just still wine gross margin.", "John Faucher - JPMorgan", "It\u2019s wine gross margin. Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Gallant with Goldman Sachs.", "Ryan Gallant - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks for taking the question. Just had a quick one, how are you planning to address your debt that\u2019s coming due this year? Do you think you will have to approach the market for that?", "Bob Ryder", "Yes, we can\u2019t wait to payoff that 8 3/8% note. So, we currently have the flexibility, we are in good position to do what we want to, right. We can use our revolver, which would give us very positive arbitrage, because our securitization facilities are LIBOR plus 90 and the revolver is LIBOR plus 175, which is quite a bit less than the 8 3/8% notes, right or I think we can do this at any point in the year, right, if we would like to secure some longer term financing albeit at a higher rate than the securitization or the revolver. We could also do that. So, we are kind of keeping our powder dry around that to see how the markets behave, how rates are, and how we feel our future free cash flow needs will be.", "Ryan Gallant - Goldman Sachs", "Got it. That\u2019s all I have. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Torres with HSBC.", "Lauren Torres - HSBC", "Good morning, everyone. Just a follow-up on beer and specifically the Corona brand, I think in one of your responses to a question you said that depletions of the Corona brand were up low single-digits in the quarter, just curious to get your perspective on the pricing or the ability to price on this brand, it seems like there hasn\u2019t been aggressive pricing or at least there has been some pullback in pricing. So, I was just trying to get the correlation here, if you feel there is more room on pricing on the Corona brand, do you think that low single-digit growth rate is still achievable or you feel is pricing on that brand, you can\u2019t press it that hard that you will see some pushback on the volume side?", "Rob Sands", "Yes, I mean, first of all, where we priced for this year is sort of fairly well-known in that low single-digit range of around 2%. And then as far as our pricing trends go for the future, it\u2019s really a function of what occurs in the marketplace, which obviously we watch very carefully and what occurs on a market-by-market basis. So, right now, I would say it\u2019s difficult for us to comment on what will happen relative to our pricing in the future, because we simply don\u2019t know what is going to occur in the rest of the markets. So, we will have to wait and see. We take a very strategic position relative to pricing. We do it market-by-market, brand-by-brand. And we do it largely on a reactive basis. So, we will see what happens. We can\u2019t really tell you right now.", "Lauren Torres - HSBC", "But Rob, what are you seeing now though, I mean from a competitive standpoint, is there within the import category and who you consider your peers, has there been very little or no pricing in the category?", "Rob Sands", "No. I would say that you can look in the category, you can look in IRI, and there has been about low single-digit pricing. That\u2019s been the case. There has no suggestion of anything other than that.", "Bob Ryder", "It\u2019s been the case for two or three years.", "Rob Sands", "Right.", "Lauren Torres - HSBC", "Okay.", "Rob Sands", "So, we don\u2019t see anything different right now.", "Lauren Torres - HSBC", "Okay. So, that\u2019s more or less sustainable rate of pricing you see going forward?", "Rob Sands", "Well, we are not commenting on the sustainability of anything going forward. As I said, we judge that more on a real-time basis. So, don\u2019t know.", "Lauren Torres - HSBC", "Okay, alright. Understood. Thanks.", "Rob Sands", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from the line of Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research", "Good morning guys. Two questions. The first getting back to the planning question, I mean, given the fact that you guys are guiding to high single-digits depletions growth, I mean it would appear that if you kind of trace this forward, you guys \u2013 when you guys open the additional capacity on a brewery that you are going to be close to that capacity given the trends we are seeing in the market. So, what I guess other things are you thinking about in order to make sure that you have the capacity to fulfill the market as we get three years out or so?", "Rob Sands", "Yes. Like any business that\u2019s growing at the rate that we are growing, well, we will have to be capacity planning well in advance of the growth to ensure that we have the capacity that\u2019s necessary to meet the market demand. So that\u2019s what we are going to do.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research", "Okay, alright. And then a modeling question on the wine business, I mean did you guys expect depletions to be down 2%. And I guess what I am trying to drive out is if I back out shipments relative to depletions, it would seem that shipments trail depletions by 300,000 cases or so. I mean is that the level of inventory you were expecting or the inventory reduction that you were expecting?", "Bob Ryder", "Shipments and depletions were about the same number for the quarter, but when you look at growth, it gets odd, because then your year-over-year, but it was very \u2013 it was somewhat of a confusing quarter for wine because of the prior year shipment depletion, prior year mix compared to this year\u2019s mix and the reduction in distributor inventory. So, I don\u2019t blame you for scratching your head a little bit on that, but for the full year shipments will equal depletions for the wine category and there might be some quarterly ups and downs as the distributors do what they have to do to move the product.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research", "So, depletions and shipments will match despite the fact that there was a wholesaler or whatever, wholesaler that reduced inventory, is that right?", "Bob Ryder", "No, it\u2019s just for the full year it won\u2019t be all that material to the shipments depletions, right. For the quarter, it was, but for the full year, it won\u2019t be.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research", "And then so it\u2019s fair to assume that for the next three quarters or the last three quarters of the year, the numbers for shipments and depletions should be roughly in line, is that fair?", "Bob Ryder", "No. What I will say is I can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s going to happen for quarter, but I can tell you for the full year, shipments will pretty much equal depletions. Now, to your point, the distributor inventory reduction obviously, they continued to deplete, but we didn\u2019t shift right, which was material for the quarter, but it won\u2019t be that noticeable for the full year. And the quarter numbers can get a little anomalous, because you just have third-parties doing what they have to do to fill consumer demand.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research", "Okay, perfect. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "And that was our final question. I\u2019d now like to turn the floor back over to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks.", "Rob Sands", "Yes, thanks everyone for joining our call today. We are really pleased with our quarterly results and we have had a great start to the year. The team plans to continue to capitalize on the tremendous momentum that we have underway in the beer business to drive growth and enhanced financial performance. From a wine and spirits perspective, we are gaining traction and are on track to achieve our goals for the year. And I hope you have the opportunity to enjoy some of our fine products, especially the SVEDKA Stars & Stripes during the 4th of July holiday later this week. So again, thank you everybody for participating in our call today.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Welcome to the Constellation Brands\u2019 Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Thank you.", "I would now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Patty Yahn-Urlaub", "Thank you, Jackie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Constellation\u2019s conference call. In addition to our second quarter fiscal 2015 results and outlook, we will also discuss our glass sourcing strategy and incremental brewery expansion. I\u2019m here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer.", "This call complements our two news releases, which have also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable, organic and constant-currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company\u2019s website at www.cbrands.com.", "Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company\u2019s estimates, please refer to the news releases and Constellation\u2019s SEC filings.", "Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rob.", "Robert Sands", "Thanks, Patty and good morning to everyone. Welcome to our discussion of our second quarter financial results, as well as other important events that will shape the strategic direction of our company going forward.", "It has certainly been an exciting few months at Constellation. Since last quarter, we announced the acquisition of the Casa Noble tequila brand, an award-winning handcrafted super premium tequila which will be a great addition to our portfolio. Adding Casa Noble to our portfolio is important because tequila and Mexican beer share similar target consumers and drinking occasions both on and off premise. This fast growing tequila brand naturally complements our Mexican beer brands and fits well into our existing wine and spirits distribution infrastructure.", "Now during the quarter, we were challenged by a Corona Extra product recall, which was caused by defects in glass models caused by a production error at a glass plant run by one of our glass suppliers. I\u2019m very proud of the dedication and hard work of our employees, distributors and retailers who have worked tirelessly and diligently to remove potentially affected product from our retail and distribution system. While the recall impacted our financial results slightly for the quarter, we expect to replenish second quarter loss sales in the third quarter and we are currently working with our glass supplier to recover the costs of the recall.", "We announced this morning that we have begun a new 5 million hectoliter expansion at our Nava brewery in Mexico that will expand production capacity of that facility to 25 million hectoliters by the end of calendar year 2017. This project is being driven by the exceptional portfolio momentum of our beer business, which has significantly outperformed the U.S. beer market and our own expectations. Lastly, we are pleased to announce that we are in the process of finalizing the long-term glass strategy for our beer business under favorable terms with key industry players.", "The multi-faceted approach of this strategy includes the following components. We have agreed to purchase from ABI their state-of-the-art glass plant in Nava, Mexico, which is located adjacent to our brewery in that location. While this facility currently has one operational furnace, we plan to initially scale it to four furnaces, which will ultimately be able to supply us with more than 50% of our glass requirements. This transaction also includes the purchase of a high-density warehouse, land and well infrastructure and is subject to U.S. Department of Justice and Mexican regulatory approvals both of which we expect to receive by the end of this calendar year.", "We have also agreed to enter into a 50/50 joint venture with Owens-Illinois to own and operate the glass plant that we are purchasing from ABI. As the world\u2019s leading glass producer, O-I has more than a 100 years of experience in producing glass containers. They have built and expanded dozens of plants and participate in joint ventures in several different countries throughout the world. We also currently use O-I as a glass supplier for our wine business. O-I will primarily have responsibilities for plant operations including purchasing, technical services and the plant expansion. O-I is also expected to become a secondary glass supplier outside of the joint venture arrangement.", "The final piece of the strategy, we have entered into a long-term seven-year supply agreement with Vitro who is a (inaudible) leader in glass manufacturing in Mexico and we will expect \u2013 we\u2019ll ultimately supply 25% to 30% of the glass needs for our beer business. Overall, this sourcing strategy provides the best outcome in terms of quality, flexibility, cost effectiveness and control for this critical area of our beer production.", "Now because it will take some time for the glass plant to become fully operational at optimal capacity, we will continue to work with ABI to purchase glass supply needed for production at the Nava brewery under our existing Transition Services Agreement through mid calendar year 2015. In addition, we plan to continue to procure finished product from ABI under our Interim Supply Agreement until the initial Nava expansion to 20 million hectoliters is complete in calendar 2016.", "Overall, our additional investments in production capacity and glass sourcing are designed to ensure that we are well positioned to capture the continued momentum and growth opportunities we see in the marketplace for our beer portfolio well into the future. Our second quarter beer results are a testament to this portfolio momentum, as we achieved depletion growth of 8% and posted the 18th consecutive quarter of market share gains for our U.S. beer business.", "This level of growth for Constellation\u2019s beer business represents the most significant contribution to total U.S. beer dollar growth in IRI channels across all suppliers during our second quarter. These results were driven by Corona Extra\u2019s momentum of increased media support during the summer as well as the success of our Fill your Summer advertising campaign that was our first-ever multicultural, bilingual summer program.", "In IRI metric channels, Corona Extra continues to gain share and is currently the number five beer brand in the U.S. market. In addition, Corona Extra and Modelo Especial teamed up this year a broadcast sponsorship of World Cup games on Spanish language TV. Modelo Especial Hispanic Real World campaign helped to propel the continued growth of this brand, which posted consumer retail dollar takeaway trends in IRI channels of more than 30% during the quarter. In addition, Modelo Especial\u2019s summer soccer sweepstakes promotion surpassed all sales and consumer engagement targets set for this initiative.", "Modelo Especial Chelada has already become the number seven Mexican import brand in less than a year since launch. The growth of this product is being driven by Spanish language TV ads on national Spanish networks, consumer sampling at retail, PR events in key markets, social media engagements and C-store print trade ads. Lastly, the draft beer format continues to have significant momentum achieving sales growth of more than 40% during the quarter driven by the continued market expansion of Corona Light.", "The five core brands within the Constellation beer portfolio all experienced growth in the quarter and are ranked in the top 15 U.S. imported beer brands. From a brewery and operational perspective, all areas of brewery expansion are well underway and preceding on schedule from both a timing and budget perspective. Key performance metrics are being achieved with no disruption to existing brewery operations. In many areas, crews are working around the clock.", "In fact, the brewery recently achieved record capacity utilization with a record number of cases produced and shift in August. Brewery tank fabrication and installation are being completed on schedule and the packaging building is tracking the plan with steel erection in process. A new line was recently installed which is one of the largest in the world and the first beer run from this line is expected to come in coming weeks.", "From a wine and spirits perspective, the business performed well during the second quarter with depletions improving sequentially as expected. The depletion growth in the quarter was driven by excellent performance by a number of our fast-growing brands including Mark West, Kim Crawford, SVEDKA Vodka, Ruffino, Black Box and The Dreaming Tree. Our expectation is that you should continue to see improving depletion trends as we progress throughout the year similar to last year.", "As we head into our key holiday selling season in the second half of the year, we will be executing programming to ensure that we drive growth for our key brands that are mix and margin accretive, have scale and the greatest growth potential. We are well positioned to achieve this goal with initiatives that include the launch of our first-ever holiday TV advertising for Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. After the success of last year\u2019s combined Corona, Woodbridge, Butterball turkey promotion, we will once again repeat this program in advance of the Thanksgiving holiday.", "We have committed to incremental feature and display activity on several margin accretive brands including Clos du Bois, Robert Mondavi Private Selection and Rosatello and we have dedicated more sales focus on the roots to market for our spirits business now that we have Casa Noble tequila as part of the portfolio.", "During the second quarter, we received several awards for some of our key brands. Some of the most noteworthy accolades include the Leaders\u2019 Choice Award which recently saluted the industry\u2019s hottest new product in wine and spirits by awarding the best new wine product to honor our Thorny Rose brand. Wines across the Constellation portfolio earned a total of 47 medals at the 2014 San Francisco International Wine Competition including double gold and 98 point score for the 2011 Clos du Bois milestone.", "In addition, gold medals were awarded for the 2013 Woodbridge Chardonnay, 2012 Ruffino Chianti, 2012 Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Cabernet Sauvignon and the 2012 Robert Mondavi Coastal Crush. We are also proud to receive a 90 point score from both the Wine Spectator and wine and spirits for some of our well known wines including Robert Mondavi 2012 Oakville Fume Blanc and the 2010 Mount Veeder Reserve and the Franciscan Estate Magnificat.", "Now from a spirits perspective, we experienced strong sales growth in our spirits business during the second quarter driven by the recent launch of new flavor line extensions across our portfolio including SVEDKA Mango, Pineapple and Strawberry Lemonade as well as the Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy peach flavor.", "As is typical at this point in the year, I would like to provide an update relating to the California grape harvest, which is currently underway running nearly a month ahead of last year with more than 70% complete at this time. The current California industry estimate is for a total harvest yield of 3.8 million to 4 million tons versus approximately 4.4 million tons last year. The quality of this year\u2019s harvest looks to be very good if not excellent. From a pricing perspective, we continue to expect great pricing to be flat to down slightly compared to last year depending on the variety, location and demand.", "Before I close, I would like to take a minute to discuss our assessment of the impact of the recent California earthquake that occurred near Napa. We have assessed the extent of the earthquake\u2019s impact on our operations and we are very fortunate that the impact is minor. Most importantly, we are relieved that our employees and their families are safe as the earthquake occurred overnight when our facilities were closed. While there was minor damage inside some of our northern California wineries, none of them have sustained structural damage and our vineyards have not been impacted.", "In closing, we are excited about the favorable outcome of our glass sourcing strategy as we look forward to working with our excellent supply partners as they support our efforts to build upon our leading, important beer position in the U.S. We are working diligently on the Nava brewery expansion in Mexico while maintaining the strong momentum of the beer commercial business. And within our wine and spirits business, we are well positioned to drive our grape portfolio brands during the upcoming holiday season.", "I now would like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our second quarter business results.", "Robert Ryder", "Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. We have a lot of significant good news to talk about today both for the quarter and the longer term. First off, we continue to deliver beer sales that greatly outpace the industry. And despite the glass recall, we are affirming full year beer guidance. In addition, we are providing medium-term volume guidance that also outpaces our estimate of the total beer industry growth. We believe we have good portfolio and demographic evidence to support our projections.", "We\u2019ve also completed a comprehensive year long glass sourcing strategy project. The outcome of these efforts are expected to provide Constellation a continual and diversified source of beer, glass supply from leading industry providers at a cost lower than that we currently pay today. We\u2019re also increasing our medium-term operating target for beer which indicates considerable margin upside from our fiscal '15 year-to-date run rate of 32%. As a result of these factors, we foresee a continuation of a fast-growing top line and an increase to our already healthy beer profit margin.", "Finally, we will discuss increased capital spending in brewery and glass capacity to support the robust growth we are targeting. This represents investments with very high returns as the beer segment enjoys strong and growing margins and quite a high operating ROIC. I\u2019ll provide more details on the longer term items just highlighted, but now let\u2019s start looking at our second quarter results where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results.", "Our comparable basis diluted EPS for Q2 came in at $1.11, a 16% increase versus Q2 last year. We continued to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business with depletion growth of 8%. Depletions were essentially not impacted by the recall, as wholesalers worked to replenish supply at retailers before the end of Q2 from their existing inventory levels. However, the recall impacted our sales as we reversed shipments to wholesalers for approximately 2 million cases of Corona Extra.", "This translated into a reduction of approximately 37 million of net sales and $0.06 of diluted EPS for the quarter. This reduction is reflected in the $1.11 Q2 EPS. We expect to replenish this volume with shipments to wholesalers primarily during the third quarter, as we work to bring wholesaler inventories back to more normal levels.", "Wine and spirits results for Q2 benefitted from higher volume and lower promotional expense during the quarter. Both businesses remain on track to reach their full year profit goals and we are affirming our fiscal '15 comparable basis EPS outlook of $4.10 to $4.25 a share. Given those brief highlights, let\u2019s look at Q2 performance in more detail.", "As you can see from our earnings news release, consolidated net sales grew 10%. This result included 73 million of incremental beer net sales as we consolidated an additional week of sales in Q2 fiscal '15 versus Q2 fiscal '14 as a result of the timing of the beer business acquisition. Excluding the benefit of these acquired sales, consolidated organic net sales growth for the quarter was 5%.", "For the full quarter of Q2 fiscal '15 versus the full quarter of Q2 fiscal '14, beer segment organic net sales increased 9%. This was primarily from volume growth driven by strong consumer demand. This result includes the impact of the recall that I just outlined. Wine and spirits net sales on a constant-currency basis increased 3%. This primarily reflected volume growth of 1% and lower promotional expense.", "For the quarter, consolidated gross profit increased $109 million and our consolidated gross margin was 43% versus 40% from the prior year second quarter. The increase in gross profit primarily reflects 33 million of incremental benefit from consolidating the beer business for one additional week in Q2 of fiscal '15 as well as growth of the base beer business and lower promotional expense and favorable mix for wine and spirits. The increase in consolidated gross margin primarily reflects higher brewery profits, beer volume and pricing benefits in the wine and spirits gross profit factors that I just mentioned.", "SG&A for the quarter increased $48 million. The incremental SG&A associated with consolidating the beer business was 12 million. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to higher marketing and SG&A for the beer business. Due to the factors just mentioned, Q2 consolidated operating income increased 62 million and consolidated operating margin improved 160 basis points. Interest expense for the quarter was 85 million, down 6% versus Q2 last year. The decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates.", "That provides a good spot to discuss our deposition. At the end of August, our total debt was 7.2 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled 7.1 billion, an increase of 131 million since the end of fiscal 2014. The increase primarily reflects the funding of the 558 million post-closing purchase price adjustment payment made during the quarter for the beer transaction offset by our free cash flow generation.", "We have 500 million of 8 3/8 senior notes coming due in December. We\u2019re evaluating funding alternatives for the repayment of this debt including utilizing existing credit facilities and tapping into the senior note market. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 32% and compares to a 29% rate for Q2 fiscal '14. The Q2 fiscal '14 rate included the favorable outcome of various tax items. We continue to expect our full year fiscal '15 comparable basis tax rate to approximate 30%.", "Now let\u2019s discuss free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx spend. For the first half of fiscal '15, we generated 360 million of free cash flow compared to 440 million for the same period last year. Operating cash flow for the first half of the year totaled 668 million versus 489 million for the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to the incremental cash generated by the consolidated beer business.", "CapEx for the first half of fiscal '15 totaled 308 million compared to 49 million last year. CapEx for the beer segment totaled 229 million as activities for the initial 10 million hectoliter brewery expansion continue to progress. For fiscal 2015, we are updating our free cash flow projection and now expect free cash flow to be in the range of 275 million to 350 million versus the previous range of 425 million to 500 million. The change was primarily driven by additional CapEx requirements for the incremental 5 million hectoliter brewery expansion and glass sourcing initiatives that Rob mentioned earlier.", "Total CapEx is now projected to be in the range of 725 million to 775 million versus a previous 575 million to 625 million. Our new CapEx projection includes 600 million to 650 million for the beer segment. We view this as very positive news as we have the opportunity to invest in a growing, high margin, high ROIC business. We are still targeting operating cash flow to reach at least $1 billion for fiscal '15 and we expect to continue deleveraging.", "Now let\u2019s move to our full year fiscal 2015 P&L outlook. We continue to forecast comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.10 to $4.25 a share. For fiscal '15 we continue to target net sales growth for the beer segment to approximate 10% with high single digit shipment and depletion volume growth and operating income growth in the range of 25% to 30%. When factoring an estimated full year of brewery for fiscal 2014, underline operating income growth for the beer segment is still expected to be in the mid teens.", "For wine and spirits, we continue to target net sales and EBIT growth for fiscal '15 to be in the low to mid single-digit range. Our comparable basis guidance excludes unusual items, which are detailed on the last page of the press release.", "Now I\u2019d like to provide some financial highlights related to our strategies around glass sourcing and beer production capacity that Rob outlined. Our beer business has great momentum in the marketplace growing ahead of our expectations since the acquisition and well ahead of the total beer category.", "We believe we are positioned to continue outpacing the beer category behind positive demographic and portfolio factors, some of which include consumers trading up to high-end beer, growth and increasing influence of the Hispanic consumer who have a high propensity for our brands, great alignment with our goal to distributor network, distribution gains for all brands, draft and can format expansion and packaging and product innovation.", "As a result of these factors, we are targeting annual volume growth to be in the mid-single-digit range over fiscal '16 to fiscal '18 timeframe, a sales trend that we believe would outpace growth projections of the total U.S. beer industry.", "To ensure we are best positioned to capture this growth opportunity, we have begun a new 5 million hectoliter expansion at our Nava brewery, which will take it to 25 million hectoliters of production capacity. The estimated cost for this investment is 450 million to 550 million and is expected to be completed by the end of calendar 2017. When you combine this with our initial 10 million hectoliter expansion, our total brewery capacity investment is estimated to be $1.45 billion to $1.65 billion.", "As part of our beer, glass sourcing strategy, we have reached an agreement with ABI to acquire their glass plant, warehouse and rail infrastructure and land that is adjacent to our Nava brewery for an acquisition purchase price of about $300 million. We\u2019ve also agreed to form a 50/50 joint venture with Owens-Illinois to own and operate this glass plant. O-I will contribute approximately 100 million for its 50% share of the joint venture. The joint venture will not include the acquired warehouse, rail infrastructure or land. The JV will provide bottles exclusively for the Nava brewery.", "The glass JV partners plan to expand the capacity of the plant from one furnace to four furnaces over the next four years at a cost of approximately $300 million to $400 million. The expansion costs will be shared equally between Constellation and Owens-Illinois. Since we expect to consolidate the JV results, the full expansion costs would be included in our CapEx line in our statement of cash flows with O-I\u2019s contribution being displayed as a separate benefit in the financing section of our cash flow statement. Constellation also expects to spend approximately 175 million to 225 million outside of the JV to enhance the site infrastructure for the rail and warehouse at the newly acquired site.", "For the beer business projects just highlighted, we have summarized the associated tax assessments and timeframes in a table that was included in our glass sourcing and capacity expansion press release issued earlier today. Given the collective activities just outlined, we are targeting our beer segment operating margin to be in the mid 30% range in fiscal '18, which we believe is best-in-class among the North American competitors.", "With the incremental CapEx investment, our goal of exceeding free cash flow generation of $1 billion is now targeted to move out in fiscal '18. Even with the higher CapEx requirements, we still expect to delever at a good pace and reach our goal of debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio below four times in fiscal '16, as operating cash flow and EBITDA growth of the business allows to delever despite the increased capital spend.", "Operating within our three to four times target leverage range provides us the financial flexibility to access the initiation of a dividend and/or additional stock buybacks. Once we move past the heavy fiscal '16 and '17 peak CapEx spend years, free cash flow should growth dramatically, which will provide us even more financial flexibility while we stay within our targeted leverage ratio range.", "In summary, we\u2019re very pleased with how fiscal '15 is progressing. The wine segment is expected to grow EBIT in line with sales and see strong execution in the marketplace during the key holiday season. Our beer business has tremendous momentum in the marketplace and continues to gain market share. It has a very strong financial profile and is among the industry leaders from a sales growth and profit margin perspective. Our high return investments in beer production capacity position us to support the momentum and significant growth opportunity we see for the beer business.", "With that, we\u2019ll open up the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.", "Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Hi, good morning.", "Robert Ryder", "Hi, Bryan.", "Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "I guess we fielded a few questions this morning just trying to reconcile the margin expectations in beer relative to some of the new news we had today, and I guess maybe if you can just walkthrough some of the puts and takes because right now it looks like if you look back at the last four quarters or so, the operating profit margin in beer are in the low 30s. And I guess what we\u2019re expecting to see over the next three years is more capacity, more production in in-house which should be accretive to margins. It sounds like glass cost would be lower which should be accretive to margins. There\u2019s been some pricing in this model over the last year or so and I would assume that there should be some pricing as we look forward. So I\u2019m just trying to understand why it wouldn\u2019t be better if there is some other cost that you\u2019re expecting to incur whether it\u2019s increased marketing or something else that might sort of dampen the margin expectations?", "Robert Ryder", "Yes. So year-to-date we\u2019re at a 32% operating profit margin which has increased from last year. And what we\u2019re seeing is we\u2019re going to go to the mid-single digits as we build out the brewery and glass plant, right. So depending where you pick in the mid-single digits, that\u2019s pretty good margin expansion. The other thing to factor in is we think mid-single digits is pretty much the highest operating profit margin of beer companies in North America, right, the mid-30%. So in our models, we have factored in all that\u2019s going on with glass, we put assumption there what we think is going to go on with pricing based on history and we have in there what we think is going to go on with commodity inflation in the beer segment. So for me personally, right, I\u2019m thrilled with the mid-30% profit margin. I\u2019m not sure why people are disappointed. There is nobody with a higher margin than that in North America.", "Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "I guess and I hear you, I think it\u2019s just kind of knowing what we know now and there seemingly to be more of a list of tailwinds versus headwinds, I think that\u2019s the component that people are kind of stuck on today. There\u2019s two things you can clarify. When we\u2019re talking about mid-30s, is that 34 to 36? And then I guess the second piece, I guess if there is going to be some JV income associated with glass, should that be \u2013 is that incorporated in that mid-30 margin target or would that be on top of?", "Robert Ryder", "Yes. So mid-30%, yes, I guess most math people would say that\u2019s 34, 36. I think that\u2019s a reasonable comment. The other thing just to factor this in, Bryan, and you guys would have done that, right, this increased capital spend does increase depreciation expense, right. Now, our brewery assets are long-lived assets, right, the majority is probably 15 to 20 years, but there\u2019s a lot of capital going in which is going to start depreciating which does cause some reported headwinds on margins. And what was the last piece of\u2026?", "Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "The JV income?", "Robert Ryder", "Yes, good question. And again, you guys understand this, so we will be consolidating the JV because under GAAP based on the contract with us and Owens-Illinois, we are considered to control the JV, right. So what will happen there is as consolidation, we will just \u2013 our cost of goods sold will be lower. We\u2019ll essentially be recording the cost of the bottles, right, which helps margins, okay. We will also consolidate the balance sheet, right, so you\u2019ll see all that capital spending coming on our balance sheet and the Owens-Illinois contribution will come in down \u2013 I think it\u2019s going to be a separate line of net income, okay, and the cash contribution will be begin the financing section of the cash flow statement.", "Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "So that makes it outside of the operating profit and the margins?", "Robert Ryder", "That\u2019s correct. Well, JV, yes, because we\u2019ll be consolidating. So the JV will not exist in our financial statements, right. The JV is going to be a private company is how that will work.", "Bryan Spillane - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Robert Ryder", "Hi, Judy.", "Robert Sands", "Good morning.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "I guess I wanted to just follow up on the EBIT margin on beer and I agree that the mid-30% is obviously a very good margin for this business. I guess I would just challenge you though in just terms of thinking about compared to the other beer companies, you do have higher price points which obviously raises your gross margin versus some of the peers. So I\u2019m just trying to really understand kind of how this margin outlook is being impacted by the cost savings that you\u2019re generating really on the packaging costs, in particular as you think about what you\u2019re paying for glass today and then with all these different relationships that you\u2019re building. And then the JV that you\u2019re owning in-house, it seems like your packaging cost could be a lot higher, so maybe just starting off just a little bit more color on that particular topic?", "Robert Ryder", "Yes, and it\u2019s a little bit difficult, right, because a lot of data is not out there but we have a very different business model from the North American \u2013 most of the North American competitors, right. We\u2019re making all our products in one site which is quite a distance from a lot of our consumers, right, take the New York city consumers. So we have a reasonable amount more freight, okay, versus \u2013 and freight is \u2013 as you know, Judy, freight is a very big component of cost in beer. So we have a lot more freight costs. We probably also have higher cost of goods sold, right; thicker bottles, higher quality ingredients, all that kind of stuff. So it\u2019s difficult to compare them apples-to-apples. But as I look at our beer model, we\u2019ve kind of got the growth that the craft brewers have coupled with the margins that the large domestic guys have. So we\u2019re almost the best of both worlds from a beer perspective. And if you look at some of the data that\u2019s out there, right, generally speaking you could say we\u2019re probably paying around, I don\u2019t know, $0.16 a bottle right now. That data is out there from InBev. We\u2019ve said that that will come down. We\u2019re not really saying how much that will come down because we think that\u2019s competitive data, but we went through a full year of negotiations with all the big glass players in the world and we\u2019re pretty happy where we end up there both from a cost and a quality perspective.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And just to clarify, the $0.16 includes the freight cost that you\u2019re paying to get the bottle delivered to your production facility?", "Robert Ryder", "That\u2019s correct, but the glass we\u2019ll be getting going forward is going to be coming from a number of different sources which will all have different, I\u2019ll say, manufacturing costs and different freight costs depending where it\u2019s coming from.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Right, okay. And then maybe just in terms of the Corona Extra trend and I think that accretion certainly in the quarter doesn\u2019t appear to have been impacted by the recall. The more recent Nielsen or IRI data has shown a bit of softer trend for Corona Extra and some of this may just be a comparison issue, but just really wanted to kind of understand from your perspective how do you access the recall impact, if any, is having on sort of the underlying trend of Corona Extra as you see it today?", "Robert Ryder", "Yes. Judy, so right now as you said we look at IRI, it\u2019s still pretty early in the game to say what\u2019s happened to Corona Extra and I don\u2019t get overly alarmed over weekly IRI data because there\u2019s a lot of anomalies in just a week. You can see that Corona Extra has slowed down a little bit, but remember there were actually some retailers \u2013 not a ton but we were physically out of stock during the recall process, we were off the shelf for a period of time. So we would expect that to kind of come across in IRI. Luckily, we\u2019re very happy with our overall depletion trends, right, and hopefully if Corona \u2013 the consumer wasn\u2019t grabbing the Corona, he would grab a Modelo Especial or Pacifico and I guess in future months, we\u2019ll see how the Corona Extra brand bounces back after this recall. But we couldn\u2019t ask for better cooperation from both our internal employees and from the distributors and from retailers. It was just a really well done and an unfortunate circumstance, but we think we minimized the damage.", "Robert Sands", "Judy, I might add that we\u2019ve been tracking the weekly IRIs pretty carefully. We saw a little blip two weeks ago but we also noticed a number of other products that were affected, so it looks like it might have been a peculiarity with the week and then the latest data was very robust and appears that the brand was completely unaffected. So as Bob said, we\u2019re pretty hopeful that in general the recall is not going to have any impact on the momentum on the brand. And clearly the momentum on our other brands has been totally unaffected by the Corona recall. So the business in general remains very strong from a consumer takeaway point of view.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, got it. Thank you.", "Robert Ryder", "Thanks, Judy.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.", "Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks. A couple of questions. Just getting back to the beer margin because I know obviously that\u2019s the most frequently asked question coming in from investors. So is it fair to assume that the target you have laid out, the kind of mid-30s; 34 to 36, is pegged to your mid-single-digit volume assumption? I guess the reason why I\u2019m asking the question is let\u2019s just say that things are even better than you thought which clearly has been the case the last couple of years, things have been coming in better than you expected and volumes are actually higher. I\u2019m just wondering how you think that will impact the margin given now you are manufacturing, you should get some operating leverage, so if you can address that question would be really helpful. And the second question just kind of more of a tactical thing, just curious how the repositioning of Victoria is doing? If you can give us any more clarity around Modelo Chelada, it looks like the SKU and the brand is really starting to gain some momentum, so just trying to get an understanding of how big of a contributor that can be going forward?", "Robert Ryder", "Okay, Nik, so I\u2019ll take the first one and Rob will take the commercial question. So, yes, I mean when we give these guidance out, we try to tie-in the whole P&L. So in your case if we exceed the volumes that we put out there, obviously we would get good fixed cost leverage, okay, especially on that big depreciation number. So, yes, that would certainly help margins. I\u2019ll let Rob answer the Victoria\u2026?", "Robert Sands", "Yes, so Victoria; we did reposition Victoria originally when we introduced it \u2013 we introduced it above Corona Extra in pricing and we brought the pricing on that down to the Corona level and we expanded distribution nationally and I would say that there\u2019s a lot of momentum behind the brand right now. Actually I\u2019d say that we\u2019re pretty excited about the prospects for Victoria for the feature and with the repositioning we\u2019re seeing a lot of very, very positive momentum in that. Chelada; great product, taste great. We really think that from a competitive point of view it\u2019s the best product out there. Again, a lot of momentum. We\u2019re a bit constrained on the package at the moment until we get our can line up and running shortly and that\u2019s really been the only limiting factor on the brand. Otherwise, we could actually sell a lot more of it than in fact we have been selling and we will as soon as that can line is up and running which is it\u2019s actually up and running right this second, but in terms of being fully operational it\u2019s a few weeks away. So we\u2019re extremely optimistic on Chelada and think that that\u2019s going to be a very successful new product introduction for us.", "Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets", "Great. And just one last question, thanks for that Rob. So Bob, on the Nava brewery, if we look at it year-over-year, is the brewery running more efficiently, same as last year, less efficient \u2013 I mean can you just give us some perspective on how things have progressed over the last year within the brewery?", "Robert Ryder", "Yes, it\u2019s operating more efficiently, right. So we\u2019re getting \u2013 and we\u2019re defining that. We\u2019re actually getting more hectoliters of beer out of it at a lower cost per hectoliter and actually it\u2019s almost like every quarter it gets a little bit better.", "Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets", "Great, that\u2019s it from me. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA.", "Caroline Levy - CLSA", "Good morning, everyone. Thank you so much. Just a question on your assumptions on price and mix. You gave us a good idea on volumes for beer going forward. Just how you\u2019re thinking about the mix component and also whether you think there is room to get some pricing?", "Robert Sands", "You\u2019re talking beer I take it.", "Caroline Levy - CLSA", "In this case, yes.", "Robert Ryder", "Yes, I don\u2019t think we assumed any dramatic increase in mix but as you said, the thing supporting the volume growth calls for a lot of growth in cans and kegs. So they would have a mix impact. On pricing, we would have assumed probably historical pricing going forward, but as you know pricing gets determined based on the local geographies and all the competitive dynamics, but for an Excel model you have to assume something. So we would have just assumed probably close to continuation of historical trends.", "Caroline Levy - CLSA", "Right. So you\u2019re saying mix will go slightly negative as you rollout cans and kegs?", "Robert Sands", "No. Cans would be a positive mix; kegs kind of neutral that\u2019s because aluminum is cheaper than glass and cans cube out better with freight. You can fit more on a freight car than bottles because you don\u2019t have to insulate them and they\u2019re just better\u2026", "Caroline Levy - CLSA", "Right. So a bit of margin mix but on revenue, on price mix\u2026?", "Robert Sands", "Cans, we are line priced on cans except for Modelo Especial cans which are at a slightly lower price. For Modelo Especial specifically right now bottles are growing faster than cans. Probably the big can upside is on Corona Extra where we expect to have the same price as bottles.", "Caroline Levy - CLSA", "Got it. And how is your can capacity doing for the Corona Extra product?", "Robert Sands", "It will be doing well very shortly as soon as that new can line is fully operational which as I said is shortly. It\u2019s actually up and running right now but in test mode.", "Caroline Levy - CLSA", "But you\u2019ll run all cans on that line then and you\u2019ll be able to therefore drive this much faster on Corona Extra as well as on Chelada.", "Robert Ryder", "Yes, so what you\u2019ll be seeing and we\u2019re actually coming out with a really gorgeous Victoria can as well, but our can capacity will be going up and will be able to support all this can growth. And also on Corona Extra specifically we\u2019ve actually already have a media campaign specifically I\u2019ll say describing the activities you would do with a can that you wouldn\u2019t do with the bottle. Same great Corona liquid, right, but you can do certain things with cans that you can\u2019t with bottles and shots of the beach, the boats, sporting events, things like that just to get peoples\u2019 heads around, hey, Corona is great. Let me try a can. Right now, Corona Extra probably less than 2% of the mix is cans. So we think that\u2019s a pretty big opportunity to drive growth.", "Robert Sands", "If you look at the industry in general, what you\u2019ll see is cans is really where the vast majority of the growth is in the industry. You may be looked at the domestics which as you know are biometrically in general down but cans are actually growing and are being more than offset by glass and craft, cans are the latest craze. And as Bob said in our case, we see huge opportunity in cans because it\u2019s such a low percentage of our business and there is so much momentum from an industry perspective against cans period. So we\u2019re pretty excited about the can potential of our business.", "Caroline Levy - CLSA", "That\u2019s great. And then if I might ask, it\u2019s back to margins, the components of what you think will drive the margins to the mid-30s and how much of that is the glass transaction?", "Robert Ryder", "Yes, glass is certainly factored in there and essentially what will happen as the additional glass JV furnaces come up, right, we will be able to reduce the glass that we\u2019re buying from other furnaces. The guaranteed upside will be there is freight, right, because the glass JV is attached to the brewery. So there is no freight cost. So as those furnaces come up, our landed glass cost comes down. And so glass is a pretty good component of our margin expansion from the 32% that we have year-to-date to the mid-30% we said we\u2019ll have in the very near future.", "Caroline Levy - CLSA", "Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.", "Alice Longley - Buckingham Research", "Hi. Good morning. I have a couple of questions; one is a follow up to that. I think that you gave us originally a target of getting to the mid-30% margin without glass. So I\u2019d like to \u2013 what other things are going right between now and then besides glass to get the margin number?", "Robert Ryder", "Yes, the guidance we gave without glass was low to mid 30%.", "Alice Longley - Buckingham Research", "Okay.", "Robert Ryder", "So you can go back to the investor meeting, so that was the guidance that we provided. Now with glass and with new news, right, whatever positives and negatives, we\u2019re increasing that to mid-30%. What you get is depending where you pick in the 34% to 36% is a pretty big increase in margins and the highest anybody has in North America.", "Alice Longley - Buckingham Research", "Maybe I shouldn\u2019t be belaboring this, but you had said low to mid 30s without glass, so there was something that made you think you could get to the mid-30s without glass and it looks like maybe that contribution has gone away, and could you comment on that?", "Robert Ryder", "Yes, I could but I do think we\u2019re past the belabored part here with this question, right. We give ranges because this is a business with many moving parts, okay, and especially this business as you know, Alice, has many moving parts because we\u2019re growing so fast. Most of the moving parts are really good as are our margin assumptions I think to have the volume growth amongst the top of the industry and to be saying we\u2019re getting to the margins in the top of the industry I think is \u2013 I\u2019m looking at this as very good news. And then the ability, right, to reinvest the enormous free cash flow that this business spins off into a very high return on invested capital business, right, it really helps the shareholder value creation that I think Constellation is driving out of this beer segment.", "Alice Longley - Buckingham Research", "Okay. My question is on your cash flow for next year, for fiscal '16. You\u2019ve said that with all the incremental CapEx and your acquisition costs, you still think you\u2019ll be generating cash to reduce debt. You must have a pretty good sense of what CapEx will be in fiscal '16 in order to say that. I mean with all the bits and pieces you\u2019ve given us, it looks like CapEx might be around $1 billion in fiscal '16 and then you got 300 million for the acquisition and I\u2019m having trouble getting cash leftover after that. Are those assumptions for CapEx too high?", "Robert Ryder", "So I think what I would do is we\u2019ve given you the bigger pieces of capital spending albeit we haven\u2019t said what specifically in fiscal '16 because that will be part of the guidance we provide in April. But we have said it\u2019s kind of frontend loaded right. What we provided in that table in the glass press release is not holistically comprehensive. It excludes wine, it excludes maintenance CapEx, it excludes buying kegs. It\u2019s specifically for these projects. Now my comment on deleveraging, right, because of all the capital spend, free cash flow probably won\u2019t be an enormous number next year. Now operating cash flow could be a very good number. But the leverage rate of course is happening is the EBITDA portion, the numerator of that calculation, right, based on the volume growth in the margin expansion is probably going up quite a bit which helps the EBITDA leverage ratio come down. So it\u2019s not necessarily free cash flow, right, it\u2019s more the EBITDA generation.", "Alice Longley - Buckingham Research", "Well, that\u2019s helpful. Will there be cash leftover after the acquisition cost to reduce debt?", "Robert Ryder", "We\u2019re not providing that kind of specific guidance yet for next year because we haven\u2019t finished this year yet. So that would be like an April discussion most likely.", "Alice Longley - Buckingham Research", "Okay. But a lot of the improvement in the ratio is the EBITDA going up, I hear that. And I have one final question. If I adjust your margins in the quarter you just reported for the recall, it looks like they were 31%. They were a lot higher in the first quarter. Could you comment on why they came down and should we be using the 31% for the second half? Is there some reason to expect an improvement in the second half versus that 31%?", "Robert Ryder", "I think we\u2019ve given our guidance for the full year that expect beer operating profit margins to be around 32%. This quarter there was a pretty big increase in marketing spend in beer specifically as we really tried to hit home in the peak summer season with a lot of media flights. So that would have been a timing component. But I think year-to-date we\u2019re at about 32% and we said full year we\u2019ll be at about 32%.", "Alice Longley - Buckingham Research", "Thank you very much. It\u2019s marketing. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Thanks. Good morning, guys. Also on this topic of margin, Bob, a question about the glass component of it. Is it reasonable to think that the fact that this O-I arrangement is with a facility that\u2019s state-of-the-art and right next door to where you\u2019re brewing is better economically than the Vitro arrangement?", "Robert Ryder", "I think that probably would make sense given the fact as you said it\u2019s a brand new facility, right, and of course freight will be less.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Right, okay. And then on the Vitro component because there wasn\u2019t quite the level of detail back in August that we get into today, did that \u2013 the new Vitro agreement you have, is that going to \u2013 the cost that you\u2019re paying there for those bottles, does that include transportation costs?", "Robert Ryder", "We haven\u2019t commented on that. That\u2019s kind of competitive information.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, all right.", "Robert Ryder", "That was Vitro\u2019s release, that wasn\u2019t our release.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Right, okay, fair enough. And then just more on the accounting for this JV. Clear that it\u2019s going to be consolidated. Can you just help us? It sounds like it affects only your COGS line. Does it have any effect on other consolidated lines and then there\u2019s just a minority interest coming out below the EBIT line, is that how the economy will be?", "Robert Ryder", "I think that\u2019s right. It\u2019s just the COGS line.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Got it.", "Robert Ryder", "And then the minority interest, that\u2019s correct, it will come out as a component of net income and other cash. And then of course the balance sheet is consolidated, right, so all the capital spending will end up there and the cash coming in from Owens-Illinois and they will be funding 50% of all capital investments at the glass JV but that\u2019s going to come through the financing line.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Got it. Okay, great. Thanks, Bob.", "Robert Ryder", "Thanks, Mark.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.", "Bill Chappell - SunTrust", "Good morning. Thanks. A few quick ones. On the new expansion at Nava, does that I guess come in place of a potential West Coast facility down the road? You went through the math and it made more sense from a freight efficiency standpoint to do it all at Nava?", "Robert Ryder", "Yes, I think a couple of things. I think it was probably the fastest thing to do, right, because the facility is up and growing and we want to make sure that we can support a high growing, high margin beer business. So I think as we weigh the alternatives, we felt that both cost and speed, right, and confidence around execution was highest for Nava to bring that up to 25 million hectoliters.", "Bill Chappell - SunTrust", "And believe it or not, I have a wine question. In terms of the lower promotions this quarter, is that just more timing? You\u2019re kind of waiting it more, is that kind of what you had planned all along, maybe some color there?", "Robert Sands", "Yes, the timing of our promotional activities is more geared towards the second half of the year obviously to coincide with the OND period, the holiday period.", "Bill Chappell - SunTrust", "Okay, so it\u2019s just on a year-over-year basis it\u2019s been shifted a little bit?", "Robert Sands", "Yes.", "Bill Chappell - SunTrust", "Okay. And then last one on taxes just to get to your full year rate of 30% kind of \u2013 it equates to 28% for the back half. Is that equal in both quarters or would there be one kind of catch-up one quarter?", "Robert Ryder", "Yes, the timing of taxes is hard to predict. So we\u2019re just saying for the full year, it will be 30%. So we\u2019re not saying which quarter it will hit, what quarter will be what. But the balance of the year will have to be a lower rate than the year-to-date.", "Bill Chappell - SunTrust", "Got it. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with ISI Group.", "Rob Ottenstein - ISI Group", "Thank you very much for taking the call. Guys, given the increased amount of CapEx and in a sense business outside of the U.S., how should we think about any impact on the cash tax rate going forward, the long-term numbers and the effect of tax rate, maybe you can give us an update in terms of the long-term guidance on those two items?", "Robert Ryder", "Yes, as we generate a lot of income from this as you said outside the U.S., that will carry a lower cash tax rate. As far as effective tax rate, it should also have a lower effective tax rate when everybody gets aligned that we stop accruing U.S. taxes on foreign earnings. We are still accruing U.S. taxes on the foreign earnings and there\u2019s just a lot of discussions going on as to when or if we will stop accruing those taxes. That\u2019s from an ETR not a cash tax rate.", "Rob Ottenstein - ISI Group", "Right. So just in terms of your guidance that you gave us for cash for fiscal '18, what cash tax rate would you be using for that?", "Robert Ryder", "I think we\u2019re assuming like mid-20s.", "Rob Ottenstein - ISI Group", "Mid-20s. And there will be potential for that to go down in the following years?", "Robert Ryder", "No, cash is cash, right. The thing that could go down if we stop accruing the APB 23 U.S. accruals, the ETR could go down. Of course, if we grow the beer business faster than we say, right, that will have a lower cash tax rate. It\u2019s kind of a mix of tax rates depending where your EBIT growth is coming from.", "Rob Ottenstein - ISI Group", "Great. And I know you\u2019ve got a significant initiative on the can side. Can you give us just any kind of rough idea as you think about it between the relative margins for glass and cans for your business?", "Robert Ryder", "Yes, I mean cans are higher margin than bottles. It\u2019s not tremendously material nor is it immaterial. So it\u2019s the difference that we like if you align price with bottles.", "Rob Ottenstein - ISI Group", "So like 100 basis points on the margin type difference?", "Robert Sands", "Yes, we\u2019re not going to give you that kind of specifics.", "Rob Ottenstein - ISI Group", "Understood. Congratulations on all the glass contracts. I\u2019m sure that was a tremendous amount of work and it sounds like you\u2019ve come to a great solution.", "Robert Sands", "Excellent. Thanks, Robert.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Carla Casella with JPMorgan.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hello. This is Paul (indiscernible). Can you hear me?", "Robert Ryder", "Sure.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi. I just have a couple of questions. First, what\u2019s your view of tapping the bank loan respond market for your 2014 debt maturity and do you guys have limitations on how much bank debt you can add?", "Robert Sands", "Yes, we don\u2019t feel there is any limitations that would hold us back. I mean we\u2019re looking at the markets as we speak and I think we\u2019re in a great position. We can utilize our revolver which is at a very good rate or we can go to the senior market if we want to kind of increase the duration of our debt. And it\u2019s going to be based on what we think the market\u2019s rates are. So it will be a decision that we can make without any pressure from the outside world or covenants or anything like that. There is a lot of flexibility that we have.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And have you guys spoken with the rating agencies at all regarding your expectation that leverage will remain over four times through 2016?", "Robert Sands", "We have, yes. So the rating agencies are insiders, so they have a look at how we think the financials will pan out and I think they\u2019d be pretty happy with how quickly we are delevering and again mostly it\u2019s because we\u2019re growing EBITDA so quickly which just shows the fundamental positive economics of the business.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from the line of Tim Ramey with Pivotal Research.", "Tim Ramey - Pivotal Research", "Good morning. Thanks. Just one final point on the overly [belabored] beer margin question. You don\u2019t give EBITDA margin targets on that, but it sounds to me like it would be fair to say, well, while margins are going up modestly, EBITDA margins are going to go up more meaningfully. Is that a fair statement?", "Robert Ryder", "I\u2019m not sure if I understand the question. We\u2019re not commenting all around O-I margins but EBITDA is certainly growing which is helping bring down the EBITDA leverage\u2026", "Tim Ramey - Pivotal Research", "But what people seem to be missing is that the depreciation is impacting the O-I margin and so the EBITDA will be a better number based on the cash\u2026?", "Robert Ryder", "Sure. As we said earlier, right, there is a lot of [DA] (ph) coming into the P&L as spend all this capital. I don\u2019t know why you keep saying O-I. This has nothing to do with O-I. They\u2019re not on our books. But yes, the EBITDA to your point will be much higher than the EBIT because DA is going up so much, right, is your point which is a good point. Thank you.", "Tim Ramey - Pivotal Research", "Okay. And then just finally on wine, it is a beautiful crop out there and I\u2019m almost done harvest. It looks to me like margins have the ability to expand a bit going into fiscal '16. Would you agree with that statement just directionally?", "Robert Sands", "Yes. We think that margins can expand a little bit going into fiscal '16.", "Tim Ramey - Pivotal Research", "Okay.", "Robert Sands", "We\u2019re seeing growth, we\u2019re seeing positive mix and we\u2019re seeing a little pricing. That\u2019s a good combination.", "Robert Ryder", "As you said, Tim, the crop is coming in very high quality and we think overall the cost per ton will be similar to last year, so not a lot of grape cost inflation which is good news for margins.", "Robert Sands", "I think generally a balanced supply and demand situation.", "Tim Ramey - Pivotal Research", "Because we\u2019re a month ahead if there are any meaningful impact on cash flow this year from just the timing of harvest or is that not material?", "Robert Ryder", "No, there won\u2019t be anything meaningful.", "Tim Ramey - Pivotal Research", "Okay. Thanks so much, guys.", "Robert Sands", "Thanks a lot, Tim.", "Operator", "That was our final question. I would like to turn the floor back over to Rob Sands for any additional remarks.", "Robert Sands", "Thanks everyone for joining our call today. Needless to say, it\u2019s an exciting time to be in Constellation. We believe we have very significant growth opportunity within our beer business and glass of course is a critical component of our beer production. As such, I\u2019m very pleased with the final outcome of our long-term glass strategy with key industry players in order to ensure that we have the quality, capability and flexibility to meet the growing demand for our iconic beer portfolio.", "We also have solid momentum for our wine and spirits business as we head into the second half of the year, and we are well positioned for a great holiday selling season. Our next quarterly call is scheduled after the New Year, so please be sure to enjoy some of our excellent products during the holidays.

And welcome to the Constellation Brands\u2019 Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.", "I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Patty Yahn-Urlaub", "Thank you, Lorie. Good morning everyone, and welcome to Constellation\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2015 conference call. I\u2019m here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Ryder, our Chief Financial Officer.", "This call complements our news release which has been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable, organic and constant-currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company\u2019s website at www.cbrands.com.", "Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company\u2019s estimates, please refer to the news releases and Constellation\u2019s SEC filings.", "And now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rob.", "Rob Sands", "Thanks, Patty. And good morning and Happy New Year to everyone. Hope everybody got a chance to enjoy some of our great products over the holiday with their family and friends. ", "Welcome to our discussion of Constellation\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2015 sales and earnings results. Before we get started with the review of the quarter, I believe it's worth noting that we posted another year of exceptional stock price performance with Constellation stock increasing almost 40% for calendar year 2014. ", "Now this is the third consecutive year that Constellation was one of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index. Our stock price has been on fire, increasing almost 400% during the three-year time horizon beginning in calendar 2012. This tremendous stock price appreciation is being driven primarily by our beer business which has incredible momentum and we believe strong potential for future growth. And we\u2019re making smart investments now to ensure that we have the quality, capacity, control and flexibility to help us meet demand for our iconic beer brands well into the future. ", "In addition to our on-going brewery expansion in Nava, Mexico, we recently began implementing our multifaceted glass sourcing strategy which includes the acquisition of ABI\u2019s state-of-the-art glass plant which is located adjacent to our Nava brewery. The formation of a 50:50 joint venture with Owens-Illinois, the world's leading glass container producer to own, operate and expand the Nava glass plant, and the execution of a glass supply agreement with Mexican glass manufacturer Vitro, which will begin to ramp up glass supply in fiscal 2016. Overall we believe this comprehensive sourcing strategy provides an optimal solution for this essential component of our beer production process. ", "Our third quarter beer results are evidence of the great momentum we are currently experiencing for the business, as we achieved depletion growth of 8% with strong underlying sales growth. These results are some of the best in the industry. In fact, Constellation\u2019s beer business generated the vast majority of total U.S. industry volume growth in IRI channels during the third quarter. ", "We\u2019re growing both volume and dollar share of the industry at a time when overall beer growth is lackluster for the U.S. beer market. Our entire Mexican portfolio, including Corona Light, Pacifico, Negra Modelo and Victoria are all delivering strong growth, which is leading to record sales results brand by brand across the entire business. ", "Corona Extra continues to dominate as the number one imported beer in the U.S., selling greater than 50 million more cases than the next closest import competitor and growing at the highest trend rate in years. These results are being driven by distribution growth, velocity gains and incremental marketing support, including the general market and Hispanic Find Your Beach and Epic Moments advertising campaigns as well as the return of the O' Tannenbaum spot on English and Spanish language TV during the holiday season. ", "Modelo Especial continues to perform beyond expectations and is expected to soon surpass Heineken across all channels as the number two imported beer in the U.S. Continued investment in national Hispanic TV helped propel the continued growth of this brand, which posted consumer retail take away volume trends of more than 20% in IRI channels during the quarter. ", "Corona Light posted solid growth during the quarter driven by the continued success of Corona Light draft which entered three new markets as well as increased distribution for bottles and cans. Ongoing marketing support featured national football retail promotions which helped merchandise the draft format in the on-premise channel during football season. Overall the strong shipment volumes that the beer business generated in the third quarter are the primary driver of the upward revision to Constellation\u2019s overall EPS guidance for fiscal 2015. ", "Keep in mind the distributors also increased their inventory levels during the quarter in order to return them to more historical levels as well as to support the ongoing growth opportunities for our product portfolio going forward. As a result, the second time this year we are increasing our fiscal 2015 forecast for the beer business and now expect beer sales to grow in the low teen range with operating profit growth of mid to high teens. ", "From a brewery and operational perspective, all areas of brewery expansion are well underway with the project expansion on schedule from both a timing and budget perspective. Our second can line which was installed in late summer has become operational and is expected to significantly supplement our can product availability as we continue to pursue this market opportunity. ", "Major structural steel erection for the packaging building was completed on schedule in mid-December and the remaining beer tanks were installed in the brewhouse in late November. We initiated investment activity for the recently announced 5 million hectoliter capacity expansion and we have progressed with rail logistics and site infrastructure additions resulting from this incremental capacity expansion. ", "Finally, the glass joint venture has ordered materials for the construction of the next glass furnace to be built on-site at the newly acquired factory. ", "Overall I am very pleased with the outstanding commercial and operational performance of the beer business. This has been driven by the dedicated efforts of our sales marketing and operations teams as well as our distributors who are collectively working together to deliver winning results. ", "And now I would like to focus on operational results for our wine and spirits business. During the third quarter, we achieved EBIT growth for the wine and spirits segment that is expected to drive results for the year at the upper end of the low to mid single digit guidance range that we previously provided. ", "Our spirits business performed exceptionally well, posting sales growth of more than 25%. We began integrating the Casa Noble tequila brand into our portfolio and the brand is quickly gaining traction and beginning to contribute to our spirits business. The super premium tequila is a fantastic fit with our business and helps us to attract new consumers as tequila and Mexican beer share similar drinking occasions both on and off premise. ", "We experienced excellent sales growth for our existing spirits brands during the third quarter driven by new flavor line extensions across our portfolio, including SVEDKA Mango, Pineapple and Strawberry Lemonade as well as the recent introduction of Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy Peach flavor. ", "In addition, we gained IRI volume and dollar share of the three spirits categories that represent our market participation, including imported vodka, Canadian whiskey and brandy. From a wine perspective, outside the U.S., our Canadian business posted solid third-quarter results although our international business was negatively impacted by a decline in bulk wine sales and economic disruption in Eastern Europe. ", "In the U.S., although the U.S. wine industry remains healthy overall, we have seen a bit of a slowdown in the market growth rates we anticipated when we set our original estimates earlier this year. Thus our third-quarter U.S. wine results did not meet our growth expectations. ", "In addition, the positive mix trends that we anticipated earlier this year have not reached targeted levels as our premium priced products are growing faster than our super premium and above products. This has resulted in U.S. market share dollar erosion especially in the super premium price segment which remains highly competitive and currently generates much of the U.S. wine category growth. ", "However we have gained share in the important premium and ultra-premium price segments of the market and we are working diligently to ensure our portfolio remains relevant and top of mind to consumers in all key price segments. For example, the wine consumers\u2019 willingness to experiment with new brands and flavors over the last several years has opened a key opportunity for innovation and new product development. ", "And although our recent new product development initiatives have seen mixed results, we remain committed to innovation and have launched an enterprise-wide product development process review to improve our results in this area and increase the success rate of our new product pipeline. ", "In addition, we are currently initiating or expanding product releases in the U.S. for new wine such as PopCrush, Tom Gore Vineyards, Jail Break, Watchdog Rock and early lunch results for these brands are quite positive. We know however that the success of innovation cannot come at the expense of the health of our established brands. As such we have plans in place to concentrate our efforts on an important subset of our focus brands in order to drive key brands that are mix and margin accretive, have scale and growth momentum. ", "Although our U.S. wine business is not expected to achieve its expected market dollar share goals for the year as we are falling short of our initial expectations for volumes and depletions, we believe the hard work and significant accomplishments we have made throughout the last few years have favorably positioned the business going forward. We have negotiated the majority of our exclusive U.S. distributor arrangements which include improved performance metrics and incremental incentives that are expected to benefit Constellation and enhance wholesaler and retail execution. ", "We continue to experience solid depletion growth for a number of our fast-growing wine brands, including Kim Crawford, Ruffino, Black Box and The Dreaming Tree. And I would be remiss if I did not highlight recent awards and accolades for some of our key wine brands. ", "Market Watch magazine recently awarded the Best New Wine Product of 2014 honor to Thorny Rose. Constellation Brands received 24 medals across the portfolio at the 2014 Sommelier Challenge International Wine competition. Inniskillin Vidal 2012 reached the 99 point score, and Wine of The Year while Ruffino received seven medals, including best in class distinction and 96 points for the 2011 Ruffino Modus. ", "Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi was featured in the Best Buy section of the November issue of Wine Enthusiast Buying Guide, while Robert Mondavi Napa Valley Cabernet and Robert Mondavi 2012 Pinot Noir Reserve both received 90 point scores. These awards and accolades are a great reminder of the exceptional quality and strength in our portfolio of lines. ", "In closing, the strong commercial and operational performance of our beer business is driving significant contributions to our overall sales, profit and cash flow results. We are working diligently on the Nava brewery expansion in Mexico and we\u2019ve begun to execute our new glass sourcing arrangements while maintaining the strong momentum of the beer commercial business. ", "We have a great premium wine business and plans are in place to work through the current set of challenges we are facing. And I'm especially gratified by the fact that Constellation was one of the best performing S&P 500 Consumer Staples stocks for the third consecutive year. ", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob for a financial discussion of our third quarter results. ", "Bob Ryder", "Thanks, Rob. Good morning everyone. Our comparable basis diluted EPS for Q3 came in at $1.23. That\u2019s a 12% increase versus Q3 last year. We continued to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business with depletion growth of 8%. This result was in line with our 8% depletion growth performance year-to-date and our high single-digit depletion growth target for full year fiscal \u201915. ", "As expected, we saw a shift of approximately 2 million cases to wholesalers from the second quarter into the third quarter as a result of the previously discussed Corona Extra recall activities. This translated into a benefit of about 37 million of net sales and $0.06 of diluted EPS for the quarter. ", "Even after excluding this benefit, beer shipment volume growth came in ahead of depletion growth during Q3 as distributors increased their inventory position during the quarter to be more in line with historical levels and to be better positioned to capture growth opportunities going forward. As a result of this activity, for fiscal \u201815 we now expect beer segment net sales growth to be in the low teens range versus our previous estimate of about 10%. ", "Operating income growth for the beer segment is now expected to approximate 30% for fiscal \u201915. When factoring in an estimated full-year of brewery profit for fiscal 2014, underlying operating income growth for the beer segment is expected to be in the mid to high teens range. We still anticipate the full-year operating income margin for beer to approximate 32%. ", "While net sales performance for wine and spirits was somewhat muted during Q3 for the reasons Rob mentioned earlier, EBIT primarily benefited from lower COGS. For fiscal \u201815 we see net sales for wine and spirits tracking towards the low end of our low to mid single digit range and EBIT at the high end of our low to mid single digit range. ", "Due to the factors just mentioned, we\u2019re increasing our fiscal \u201815 comparable basis EPS outlook to $4.25 to $4.35 a share versus our previous range of $4.10 to $4.25 a share. Our comparable basis guidance excludes unusual items which are detailed in the release. ", "Given those highlights, let\u2019s look at Q3 performance in more detail where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. ", "As you can see from our earnings release, consolidated net sales for Q3 grew 7%. Beer net sales increased 16% primarily due to volume growth. Excluding the impact of the recall activity that I outlined earlier, net sales increased 11%. ", "Wine and spirits net sales on a constant currency basis were even with the prior year quarter. This primarily reflected higher spirits volume, offset by lower wine volume, higher promotional spend and lower bulk wine net sales. ", "For the quarter, consolidated gross profit increased $59 million, primarily due to the higher volume for the beer business and the favorable cost of goods sold for wine and spirits. Our consolidated gross margin increased just over one percentage point to 43.5% for the quarter, primarily due to the favorable COGS and reduced bulk wine sales for the wine and spirits business. ", "SG&A for the quarter increased $18 million. The increase was primarily due to higher SG&A for the beer business. Due to factors just mentioned, Q3 consolidated operating income increased $40 million and consolidated operating margin improved 90 basis points. ", "Equity earnings increased $3 million due to the strong results for our Opus One joint venture. Interest expense for the quarter was $86 million, down 4% versus Q3 last year. This decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates. ", "That provides a good spot to discuss our debt position. At the end of November, our total debt was $7.3 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $7.25 billion, an increase of $295 million since the end of fiscal \u201914. ", "During Q3, we issued $800 million of senior notes consisting of $400 million of 3.875 notes due 2019 and $400 million of 4.75% notes due 2024. Our strong credit and financial profile combined with the favorable interest rate environment helped us execute this attractive financing activity. Part of the proceeds from the note issuance was used to redeem $500 million of 8.375 notes during the quarter. We still expect interest expense to be in the range of $345 million to $355 million for fiscal \u201915. ", "Our effective tax rate for Q3 came in at 29% and compares to a 28% rate for Q3 last year. We continue to expect that our full-year fiscal \u201915 comparable basis tax rate will approximate 30%. ", "Now let's discuss free cash flow which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the first nine months of fiscal \u201815 we generated $209 million of free cash flow compared to $543 million for the same period last year. ", "Operating cash flow for the first nine months of the year totaled $750 million versus $629 million for the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to the benefits generated by the beer business. ", "CapEx for the first nine months of fiscal \u201815 totaled $541 million compared to just $86 million last year. CapEx for the beer segment totaled $435 million and is primarily related to the brewery capacity expansion. For fiscal \u201815 we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $275 million to $350 million and CapEx to be in the range of 725 million to 775 million. Our CapEx projection includes $600 million to $650 million of CapEx for the beer segment. ", "As a reminder, we hedge certain commodities in the energy and agricultural categories. These commodity derivatives generally do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. As a result, mark-to-market gains and losses on hedged contracts flow through our GAAP income statement. We exclude these mark-to-market gains and losses from our comparable earnings. At the time that a commodity contract is settled, the gain or loss is allocated to the appropriate business segment for reporting and will be included in our comparable earnings. This approach is in line with others in the consumer space. For Q3 there was a $20 million loss from this activity which was primarily driven by the mark-to-market on diesel fuel contracts. ", "Before we start taking your questions, I\u2019d like to note we're very pleased with how fiscal \u201815 has progressed so far and we believe we are well-positioned as we head toward the completion of another phenomenal year for Constellation. Our wine and spirits business is on track to generate solid EBIT growth for the year while our beer business has tremendous momentum in the marketplace, growing well ahead of the total U.S. beer category. ", "We\u2019re also pleased to have begun advancing efforts around our beer glass sourcing strategy with the recent formation of the 50-50 joint venture with Owens-Illinois and the JV\u2019s acquisition of the Nava glass plant. In addition, our beer production capacity expansion efforts continue to progress as planned. The glass sourcing and capacity expansion initiatives will position us to support the momentum and significant growth opportunity we see for our beer segment. ", "With that, we\u2019re happy to take your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.", "Nik Modi ", "So two questions from me. Just on the wine side, you had really good margin expansion. Obviously volumes were a bit light, and I am just curious did you make a concerted decision to really prioritize margin of a volume, is that what we should expect kind of over the next 12 to 24 months? And then the last question is just, if you can give us some updated thoughts on debt to EBITDA continues to migrate towards your target, how we should be thinking about cash flow distribution to shareholders? ", "Bob Ryder", "Sure. As you saw we did have good beer margin \u2013 I am sorry, wine margin performance in the quarter and we expect that to continue for the full year. As you know, we just changed our guidance to be at the low end of sales growth and high end of EBIT growth which means that we will see margin expansion this year. On a long-term basis, we still expect the line segment to maintain margins. I think there were some positive outcomes this year mostly around cost of goods sold which are really helping recover margins from the last few years\u2019 erosion. But I wouldn\u2019t expect big margin expansion in the wine segment going forward. But we do expect to at least maintain margins. ", "And I think around EBITDA and free cash flow, we continue to -- as you know, we\u2019re spending a ton of money in the beer segment which we're quite happy to do because return on capital in that segment is north of 40%. So it\u2019s a very quick payback and the EBITDA growth of the total company will be growing well in excess of the capital spending growth, even though capital spending is going up so much and again a lot of that's driven by the beer segment the phenomenal EBITDA growth there. So I think in line with what we've been saying over the last two years, as we have pretty good visibility to getting our EBITDA leverage below four times, I would say that the number one agenda item for use of free cash flow is returning it to shareholders and probably at the top of that list would be an initiation of a dividend. We\u2019re one of the few people certainly with our financial profile and in beverage alcohol and consumers in general -- consumer products in general they don't have a dividend and we\u2019re quite confident that this really good free cash flow generation will continue. So wee will probably be looking for dividend in the very near future. ", "Nik Modi ", "And just real quick follow-up on that dividend point. When you think about the initiation, are you thinking about something nominal to begin with or do you think you can go closer to the payout ratio of your peers from the get-go just given the free cash flow generation of the company?", "Bob Ryder", "Yes, we\u2019re still studying it. We are taking some good outside advice. But I would probably expect us to start on the lower side in order to give us a lot of room for increases. But we will look at the normal things like payout ratios, and because we expect our EBITDA to grow mostly behind beer to grow so robustly over the next few years, right, if you kind of set a payout ratio and your net income keeps going up we should have room to increase it. But we probably start out at the lower end. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.", "Bryan Spillane ", "I\u2019ve got two questions. One, just, I think in your prepared remarks when you walked through the commentary on the mark-to-market activity you referenced there was $20 million loss relative to that activity in the quarter. Was that $20 million included in the results or was it excluded from the result?", "Bob Ryder", "The $20 million was included in the GAAP results but we excluded from comparable earnings. And the reason we do this, when we \u2013 none of our commodity hedges qualify for hedge accounting and we are hedging three years out. So you would see a lot of volatility in a quarter because you\u2019d be marking to market almost 3 years of hedges every quarter, right? So we\u2019re kind of putting that stuff in non-comparable earnings. It\u2019s still in the press release, so you can see it. But we think it would kind of confuse the financial statement reader if we saw that in comparable results every quarter. And this quarter not surprisingly because of the rapid fall in fuel prices when we marked to market our diesel hedges there were losses and was about $20 million for the quarter. ", "Bryan Spillane ", "But by the time those hedges get settled at some point in the future if things don't change that settled hedge, will that somehow \u2013 could that potentially drag margins at some point in the future because it\u2019s so far out of the money or \u2013 ", "Bob Ryder", "Yes, absolutely. So sorry, I might have missed out last point. We will bring the gains or losses on these hedge contracts into comparable earnings when the contracts are settled. So to your point if diesel fuel prices don't change, this $20 million loss will come into the comparable results and we will allocate it to the individual segments based on their usage of fuel and because there's a lot more cases the majority of our fuel hedges are for the beer segment, although there are some for the wine segment as well. ", "Bryan Spillane ", "And then just a second question related to foreign exchange. The dollar has strengthened relative to the peso pretty recently, and I guess I am curious to know, you have some peso denominated costs both in your capital spending, I am assuming some of the labor associated with the construction on the Nava brewery and also in your cost of goods sold in the beer business, I'm assuming there\u2019s some peso related costs, or denominated costs in your cost of goods sold. So can you talk about if the dollar would continue to remain strong relative to the peso or continue to strengthen relative to the peso, will it have a positive effect both on what your dollar cash cost outlays are for Nava, and also will it have any impact at all on the gross profits of the beer business? ", "Bob Ryder", "So good question. So in the beer segment and look, in the grand scheme of things we're very much a North American business and actually very much a US business and in the grand scheme of things we are a net importer. So a strong dollar will help us in the grand scheme of things. Now as you can see this quarter from a translation perspective there's some hurt because the Canadian dollar is devaluing versus the US dollar. So we translate Canadian earnings, that was about a 1% hurt to our sales. ", "On the peso specifically, our peso exposed costs are as you said Mexican labor, which is an enormous piece of our total cost of goods sold. But it's a relatively large piece and also as we spend capital, those capital costs by and large get capitalized in pesos. So the depreciation on those will also be exposed to foreign exchange, although that\u2019s not necessarily cash because it's depreciation. So net, net the strong dollar will help us versus a Mexican import cost. That also being said we do hedge our transaction currencies. So we aren't 100% exposed to those peso costs because we will have some hedges going out. But net, net a strong dollar versus the peso helps us. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.", "Dara Mohsenian ", "So I wanted to get an update on growth for the draft and can portions of your business in the quarter, and also what you think the cannibalization levels are in the remainder of your business from expansion in those two areas, or if draft is even additive to your business? And also, can you give us an update on the future plans in draft and extending additional brands into that segment, whether it's Corona Light or other brands, in terms of moving into more markets with Corona Light? ", "Rob Sands", "Yes, Dara, number one, we have seen very strong growth in our draft business, about 40% growth and we\u2019ve actually seen very little cannibalization with the draft business. We\u2019ve introduced it with brands like Corona Light and in actuality not only is there not cannibalization but when we put Corona Light draft in a on-premise establishment we tend to see a pickup in the bottle or can product in the area around it, because it's really marketing. So we've expanded our Corona Light draft into, for instance, three new markets and we've also been testing Corona in draft as well and are again having extremely positive results seeing you almost no cannibalization of our glass product when we put draft in, although we\u2019re being very careful about that because we want to fully understand what the impact is. ", "Cans, same thing, great can growth, great can opportunity, represents obviously a very large portion of the market that we haven't participated in. Cans are purchased for consumption in cases where glass can't necessarily be used, boats, beach, stadiums etc. and so that also represents a purchase opportunity that largely does not result in cannibalization for us. So these package additions are definitely driving growth in the overall beer business. ", "Dara Mohsenian ", "And then also can you discuss distribution expansion potential for the Modelo Especial brand, including where you currently stand from a distribution standpoint, your expectations for calendar 2015 versus the level of expansion you saw in calendar 2014, so is it continuing with the same pace or accelerating, decelerating? And then also just longer-term where you think the brand\u2019s distribution level can get to versus Corona or other brands in the industry?", "Rob Sands", "So first of all, Modelo Especial has a huge runway for growth. Right now we\u2019re at about \u2013 on IRI terms 60% ACV and that certainly does not represent full distribution in any regard. The products still skews from a demographic point of view, extremely heavily Hispanic, even though its penetration in the Hispanic population isn\u2019t even where we would like it to be and where it could potentially be. So there's a huge runway in the Hispanic market and in the general market is very wide open for Modelo Especial and driving distribution and pods are one of our key initiatives on that brand. So and it\u2019s going extremely successfully. We\u2019ve introduced this year -- because the brand is expanding into the general market now so well we\u2019ve introduced general market television advertising which we think is going to even further accelerate the growth of this product. So the growth runway on this brand is tremendous and we don't really see any diminishment in growth rates or increases in penetration -- exactly where it's going to get to, I mean fully distributed product is usually around, I don\u2019t know, 90% ACV. So exactly when we get there, I don't know but we\u2019re going to work to get there and we have everything going in our favor. So the ability to increased distribution and as well as the ability to see velocity per point of distribution increase. So all these things are going to contribute to Modelo Especial, continuing to be really the hottest major beer brand in the market of any significance. There's really nothing of that size that\u2019s growing like Modelo Especial and just even anecdotally as you start, go around see what people are drinking, I mean you're seeing all of a sudden Modelo Especial becoming a popular product in the general market as well as in the Hispanic market. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.", "Judy Hong ", "A few questions. First, Bob, on the new sales guidance for beer, I just wanted to clarify that, that change is really all related to the shipment outperforming versus depletion in the third quarter and you're not expecting any sort of acceleration in terms of depletion growth going forward. And on that note, would you expect to see some improvement with gas prices down and you\u2019ve got a lot of growth initiatives behind your broader portfolio on beer?", "Bob Ryder", "So the increase in beer is \u2013because depletions are pretty much within our guidance, right, of like high single digits and actually depletion growth has been very consistent. The impressive thing is there is sequential improvement because Q3 and Q4 is overlapping higher growth last year. So we\u2019re very happy with the top line. The reason for the increase in guidance is more so around the net sales increase and a lot of that is driven by the distributors bringing inventories back in line with historical levels. ", "Regarding the economy, hey, look, any time the consumer has more money in their pocket, it's better for consumer product companies. Now whether we benefit more than other companies, I am not sure but it's certainly better to have more money in consumers\u2019 pockets than less. ", "Judy Hong ", "And just on that note, just the divergence in terms of maybe the category performance where wine perhaps was sequentially a little bit weaker from a category level even with the consumer getting better, do you have any sense of what's driving some of the category softness in wine?", "Rob Sands", "The category is off a little bit. It still remains quite healthy. There could be a number of factors that are contributing to that. Last year Moscato and red blends were growing at extremely rapid rates as consumers experimented, I\u2019ll say, with the new products. This year those products are still growing very well but not at the rate that they were and not that this affects us particularly but there has been a lot of pricing being taken in the below five dollar commodity segment of the wine business, the popular price and that's turned into pretty heavy negative territories. So I think that that's driving the overall market down, maybe 100 basis points or something to that effect. It\u2019s still trending pretty much sort of consistently plus or minus 100 basis points with where it\u2019s trended historically over the long-term. So but it is a little slower than we anticipated. ", "Judy Hong ", "And then my last question, Bob, I have to ask a beer margin question. So 31.5%, very good margin but it was down a little bit versus last year. So was it all just related to the SG&A step-up and was gross margin actually relatively stable? And just the phasing of the new glass contract flowing through your cost, there is a timing of it because you have now the Vitro arrangement that started in October but it sounds like that\u2019s not going to really flow through until fiscal \u201916. So any color just in terms of the phasing of how each of those contracts will start to really flow through your P&L would be very helpful?", "Bob Ryder", "So Judy, we would all be disappointed if you didn't ask a beer margin question. So thank you for restoring our faith. So I would say gross margin for the wine business was pretty consistent year-over-year. So yes, the majority of the reduction in operating margin was due to our SG&A ramp up -- beer was due to our SG&A ramp up. As we get off our transition services agreement we start stepping up in beer segment. We are maintaining the 32% operating profit margin for the beer segment for the year. So this is in line with what we expected. ", "Regarding the glass contracts, they really won\u2019t start to impact us until next fiscal year and even then the big impact is when we get our own furnaces up and when we get our own production up. So I wouldn't expect glass to have an enormous impact on margins in fiscal \u201816 either. It's more a longer dated than that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research Group.", "Tim Ramey ", "Did you say how long the diesel hedges were? When should we be thinking about seeing an EBIT positive impact coming through for lower fuel?", "Bob Ryder", "Well, it\u2019s a combination of things. And we don't hedge a 100%, so and we hedge, I will say, a smaller percent of our exposure in outer years. So we would hedge the most in the next 12 months and then month 12 to 24 will be lower percentage. So we will benefit for the unhedged piece, so we will benefit from that, right, because we\u2019re pretty much paying the spot rate. The negative is the mark to market on the hedges and when those hedges get closed out, we will see that loss in our comparable earnings. ", "Tim Ramey ", "And then on the net debt to EBITDA, the way I do the math it looks like \u2013 yes, it might reach 4.0 times in the 4Q. I know your previous guidance has been below that by \u201816 and so maybe we\u2019re splitting hairs here. Are we a little ahead of the curve?", "Bob Ryder", "I think we\u2019re pretty much where we expected. We\u2019d expect to be right around that 4.0 range at the end of the year. And you\u2019d have to see how our free cash flow comes in which we of course haven\u2019t even finished our plan next year but a lot of that will be dependent upon what quarter we spend a lot of the beer capital. But probably my guess is a lot of our deleveraging will occur in the back half of next year but we would expect to be below four times in fiscal \u201916, by the end of fiscal \u201916. And as our planning process comes through, we will get better visibility to it by quarter.", "Tim Ramey ", "And is that number kind of magical relative to the dividend discussion, maybe not for a covenant reason but just from management's mindset reason?", "Bob Ryder", "We\u2019ve kind of made it magic I guess. Look, in all these discussions there's a lot of variables but we have to pick kind of one coefficient in the equation of fixed and what we\u2019ve said is it\u2019s the EBITDA leverage. And we\u2019ve said we will begin reassessing returning cash to shareholders, because as you know we\u2019ve been one of the more aggressive people in our space but we\u2019ve done it exclusively through stock buybacks, when we bought back about 20% of our shares, under 20 bucks a share. We still have 750 million available under our board authorization. But I think what we have said now, since a lot has happened since we stopped our \u2013 since we put the stock buyback program on hiatus, that dividend will now trump stock buyback. And what we\u2019ve said is when we have really good visibility to getting below four times and staying there, that's when we start assessing the dividend and as we\u2019ve all said that looks like it will be in fiscal \u201916. So we\u2019ll probably be talking about it for our fiscal \u201816 guidance.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Financial.", "Mark Swartzberg ", "I guess two wine questions. One is the COGS benefit you got in the quarter, do you think that that kind of trend is something we should be looking for going forward? I think in the Q&A here you\u2019ve said that on an operating margin basis, you expect wine margins to remain relatively stable beyond the next few months. And then secondly, as you look at your wine share outlook which is a little below where it had been, how are you thinking about addressing those share trends? Are you okay with underperforming the category? Do you intend to spend more to try to pick up those trends? Just help us with your thinking there.", "Bob Ryder", "So I will take the first half of that, Mark, and I will let Rob handle the second half. So on COGS I would say that there's probably some anomalous activities in fiscal \u201915, I wouldn\u2019t expect that to continue. Now what I would expect -- as I said earlier I would expect margins in wine to be higher at the end of fiscal \u201815 than they were at the end of fiscal \u201914. We\u2019re not giving guidance for fiscal \u201816 but I wouldn\u2019t anticipate a lot of margin expansion going forward. The wine market share question?", "Rob Sands", "Yeah, I think consistent with what Bob just said, no, we don't like losing a small amount -- even a small amount of market share and we have a lot of plans in place around innovation, around NPV, around concentrating our spend against higher growth elements of our portfolio which we think will address that. Largely however without spending a lot more money and I think consistent with what Bob said, also important is that we maintain wine margins, we don\u2019t want to see deterioration in that segment of the business either. So we will implement basically plans and programs that will drive the top line but not necessarily increase spending and therefore hurt margins. So we intend to take a balanced approach in that regard but we definitely don't like and don't want to lose share. ", "Now if you look at our wine, spirits segment, okay, first of all, spirits is performing extremely well, above our expectations and that's a real positive in the business and we\u2019re looking at that segment of the business for further investment obviously because it\u2019s performing so well for us at the current time. And on the wine side, we had a couple of, I\u2019d say, somewhat anomalous things that had impacted us. For instance, Eastern Europe impacted us to some degree this year. Even though it\u2019s not a very significant piece of our business, it was just soft. That geography was so devastated by everything that happened, we lost some sales in Eastern Europe. We also exited some bulk wine related to the international market which did affect the top line but really didn\u2019t have any effect on the bottom line because it\u2019s just commodity bulk wine business and it was business that frankly just don't even want to continue doing and that affected the top line a bit. ", "And then in the US, we did take some pricing on some of our low-end products that impacted things on the top line but obviously contributed to our bottom line growth. And then as far as our promotional activity goes, we expect that we will be holding that flat pretty much this year. We didn't expect that to have much of an impact. It probably had a little bit of an impact but again on trying to keep a balanced approach to both the top line and the bottom line, I think that it's worked out pretty well. So all that said, we would like to hold market share, if not grow it but we\u2019re going to keep a balanced approach to growing both the top line and the bottom line. ", "Mark Swartzberg ", "And if I could ask one quick follow-up on the cash return thinking, Bob \u2013", "Bob Ryder", "And by the way, just on that note, I am reminded that we did have a pretty significant negative translation impact in Canada due to currency but as you are well aware that is largely accounting as a consequence of the strong dollar and the weak Canadian dollar, and that business being a largely domestic business. ", "Mark Swartzberg ", "And maybe this is a follow up for Patty or Bob, and on that, Rob, if we take Canada and we take Eastern Europe, we take the bulk wine, can you put those together and tell us some sort of overall, if you will, temporary revenue adverse impact?", "Bob Ryder", "You know, forex was worth about a percent, international was worth about a percent. So that would turn wine I guess from a negative 4 to a negative 2. ", "Mark Swartzberg ", "And what about the bulk wine impact?", "Bob Ryder", "That was probably less than a percent.", "Mark Swartzberg ", "And then on cash return, you\u2019ve said just now to Tim, outlook for \u2013 the guide for fiscal \u201816 for clarity on your dividend intentions, could we think about the fiscal \u201916 view as a more total view on cash return, including any potential for repo?", "Bob Ryder", "We\u2019re still assessing that, Mark. So we will talk about -- more about that in April.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Caroline Levy of CLSA.", "Caroline Levy ", "Two questions. One is pricing in beer; were you able to get pricing to cover the increased costs that you get with that inflation pricing from ABI when they sell you product? That\u2019s the first question. How does pricing look right now for you and for the rest of the industry as best you can tell? And secondly, what happened to advertising and marketing spend in the quarter? Was it up or down for both segment if you could just highlight that? I am wondering as you go to fourth quarter for marketing, what activity you\u2019d have around NFL because I guess the big brands do a lot around SuperBowl. So would that affect the trend of this 8% depletions, the fact that you are heading into a time of heavy big brand marketing?", "Bob Ryder", "So on beer pricing as we talked most of the category pricing happens happens in the fall and I think that, that pretty much progressed on plan. We aren't necessarily correlating pricing to our ABI inflation. We\u2019re at a higher level there. And you can see what's happening in the category in pricing if you look at IRI, if you look at Nielsen, regarding marketing, there\u2019s some timing. So beer marketing is up every quarter, it's up year-over-year. For this quarter, marketing as a percentage of sales in beer probably came down. That being said, to your point, we are \u2013 NFL is one of our heaviest properties for advertising. So we would expect that to ramp up in the fourth quarter and we expect marketing as a percentage of sales in beer for the full year to be up but we feel that that more than pays for itself as you can see with the results on the top line. ", "For wine and spirits, we\u2019re also increasing marketing. In the third quarter we increased it and we expect to increase it again in the fourth quarter, as Rob said mostly around our already successful focus brands, really slimmed-down version of focus brands like Kim Crawford, Mark West, brands like that, that have been very successful and we\u2019ve seen positive response and we feel that there's a pretty good payoff for increasing marketing against those brands. So we are continuing to invest in our brands, we\u2019re just working right. I mean certainly in beer we\u2019re growing well ahead of the category and wine didn\u2019t have the greatest quarter. But we're still investing in the brands and those brands have had very good results and have responded pretty well to the marketing investments. ", "Caroline Levy ", "Do you have a number on the beer side for what base Corona grew, your main brand and what on-premise looked like?", "Bob Ryder", "So Corona has been pretty consistent. Corona Extra has been growing nicely in the low single digits and I'd say as far as channels, the total on premise for beer has -- is negative, it's been shrinking. But we're gaining share in that channel. I'd say total on-premise we\u2019re growing low single digits as well. All our brands are but a lot of that is Corona.", "Caroline Levy ", "Thank you. My final question is on margins. The decline we saw in Crown in the third quarter was high SG&A. That doesn\u2019t seem like that would get smaller, that\u2019s going to ramp up as you get more independent. And until your glass costs begin to offset that, which is maybe a year out, should we then expect to the flattish margins in beer for a period of time?", "Bob Ryder", "I mean what we've said, this year we\u2019ve given a 32% operating profit guidance which is up about a 100 basis points off last year's, I\u2019ll call it kind of comparable, right, because we had a lot of activity last year, I would \u2013 we\u2019re not -- we haven't finished our own internal fiscal \u201816 look but we\u2019ve given guidance for the total beer segment, that will get up in the mid 30%, I would probably expect that to be more backend loaded as the total brewery and the additional furnaces come online more so like fiscal \u201917, fiscal \u201918 kind of timeframe. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust.", "Bill Chappell ", "Just a couple of quick questions. First on the wine side, as you look out to calendar \u201915, do you think that you can catch up with the category with kind of the new products, marketing, what have you and do you think the category will rebound? I mean are you seeing other things where we\u2019re kind of maybe at a new normal level for growth?", "Rob Sands", "The change in growth rate in the category is pretty minor and sort of this is within the range that it can fluctuate up, it could fluctuate down. It\u2019s actually kind of difficult to even know exactly where the category is growing because such a large percentage of it is really not even tracked and is therefore estimated. So when we talk about category growth it's an estimate. And I think that certainly we could see the category rebound to the previous levels of growth because we\u2019re really talking about 100 basis points one way or the other. ", "And then as it relates to us, yes, I think we can catch up. We\u2019ve got a lot of plans in place and it's really new products and new SKUs, new packaging that's one avenue that I think that will be more successful and as we move into next year because a lot of things that we put in place take some time to work albeit this year they were somewhat below our expectations. I think that nevertheless we've done some very positive things that position ourselves well for next year. And then we\u2019ve got a lot of plans relative to our existing big brands and I think will drive growth as we go into next year as well. So yes, I think we can catch up. ", "Bill Chappell ", "And then to the beer, just back to the currency question, is there a way just to quantify in the most recent quarter what the peso I guess or what kind of impact it had on beer margin profits?", "Bob Ryder", "Not really. That's getting down in the weeds. ", "Bill Chappell ", "But was it meaningful or just not something we can disclose?", "Bob Ryder", "Not tremendously because remember we have a lot of this hedge out. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore.", "Robert Ottenstein ", "First question, could you give us a little color on how Pacifico and Victoria are doing, how much were depletions up for those two brands and how the distribution on those look at this point?", "Bob Ryder", "I mean they are growing, they are gaining share. Specifically Pacifico is our largest draft account and we\u2019re being aggressive on the draft expansion and the marketing and sales guys in beer are very confident around Pacifico, it has enormous distribution opportunity and has a unique brand personality which we\u2019re just beginning to advertise. So both of those brands we\u2019re growing low to mid single digits and we would expect that to continue into the future. ", "Robert Ottenstein ", "And roughly what percentage of -- if Corona is a 100%, what percentage of the accounts at this point have Pacifico and Victoria?", "Bob Ryder", "Pacifico, maybe if Corona is a 100%, maybe 20%, Victoria half of that.", "Robert Ottenstein ", "Half that?", "Bob Ryder", "Yes, Victoria, for the full year, Victoria we might sell like 2 million case or something but it\u2019s growing very very fast. But we also think that look, right now consumers are very focused on authenticity and Victoria is probably the most -- it's probably the oldest most authentic Mexican brand out there. So we think that will really resonate with consumers as we really start to grow that brand and focus on it.", "Robert Ottenstein ", "And then second question, you may have referenced in the SG&A line to incremental costs as you have to put them on, as you win yourself away from ABI, can you give us a sense of how much those costs were in the quarter? And is that kind of the right run rate going forward or is that going to continue to step up and any sense about how much upside there may be to those numbers if they do have to go up?", "Bob Ryder", "I would say that -- I would expect that to continue to ramp up because we have to build our own purchasing department, our own engineering department. Even from a commercial perspective you\u2019re going depletions 8%, right, you\u2019re going to have to invest more in your sales infrastructure, your marketing infrastructure. So I would expect those to continue to increase. Now on top of that we also have inflation which was contractual from InBev around our finished goods supply and our raw material supply. So we can\u2019t really give numbers on that but there is a lot of moving pieces but I\u2019d say if we move up in altitude, we still expect our beer segment to get to industry-leading operating profit margins when a lot of these moving pieces sell down. ", "Robert Ottenstein ", "And then just final question, I think there was some reference to increased investment in spirits. Is that referring to possible additional acquisitions in the spirits area and perhaps could you give us a sense of what kind of areas that if that's the case would make sense?", "Rob Sands", "No, we don't have any acquisition plans in the spirits category at the moment. And when I talked about more investments, it was really against our brands that we already have. We do have plans for new line extensions, new flavors etc. and because the spirits business is growing so well that gives us the opportunity to invest more behind the growth in the existing brands. So that's basically what I was referring to, Robert.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen and Company.", "Vivien Azer ", "My first question has to do with the Modelo brand. You mentioned that it currently has about a 60% ACV in IRI channels. Can you offer a point of comparison and where that was a year ago, or two years ago?", "Bob Ryder", "Probably it\u2019s been growing mid single digits. So now what I will say on Modelo Especial, it\u2019s expanding distribution, yes but it's also growing what I\u2019ll call per capita consumption. So in cities, take Los Angeles where it\u2019s very well established with the Hispanic consumer, it continues to grow even where it is. So it's got both, I\u2019ll say per cap consumption opportunity and expansion opportunity. ", "Vivien Azer ", "Understood. On the wine side of the business, are there any other opportunities to exit lower margin businesses like you did with the bulk wine? ", "Rob Sands", "There is always opportunities to exit lower profit businesses but I would say that other than our normal SKU rationalization process, we don\u2019t have any big plans for that. ", "Bob Ryder", "We don't have an enormous exposure to the, I\u2019ll say, under $5 at retail, we have maybe two or three significant brands down there and I will say they are a strong part of the portfolio and by and large they have pretty good margin profiles. But if opportunities cropped up, or if we feel that\u2019s the right thing to do we pursue it. But I wouldn\u2019t say we have any huge plans right now to do that.", "Rob Sands", "And also interestingly enough a lot of our sort of what constitutes that low end portfolio is a lot of our legacy stuff and actually as a consequence has pretty high ROIC as we look at the portfolio. So we factor all that into our decision-making as to whether we\u2019re going to keep going with various things or not even though they may be not a 100% on strategy because there's a premium. So we\u2019ve got some dessert wines, we\u2019ve got some products that toss your wines that aren\u2019t 100% within our portfolio strategy today but actually represent or generate very high ROIC because of the legacy nature of the products. ", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson of Citi Research. ", "Wendy Nicholson ", "Hi, thanks for taking the questions, and two really quick ones. The first is, with the integration of the tequila business now behind you, can you remind us what the growth and EBIT margin gap is between spirits versus wine? I'm just wondering if the outsized growth in the spirits business impacts your ability to reinvest in the wine business or works against you? So that's question number one. And then question number two. You've only got, I guess, six weeks, seven weeks left in the quarter. And so as you go into 2016, I'm wondering -- I know you haven't given us any guidance on the beer business but do you think inventory levels will kind of have trued up and be where they ought to be as you go into 2016 so we ought to have a closer match for depletions versus shipments? That would be helpful. Thanks so much. ", "Bob Ryder", "Sure. So I will handle those, they\u2019re kind of financial \u2013 so spirits in total has very similar economics to wine as far as margins. Tequila specifically for us, now it's very small number of cases, we expect it to grow but it's very small. But it is at the higher price points \u2013 it will be by far the highest price point within our spirits portfolio. So it will have a better margin profile but I wouldn\u2019t expect it to move the needle because it is so small in the near-term. And we don't -- we will look at wine and spirits similarly and they both have very healthy margins that can afford reasonable amount of marketing and sales investments against them. ", "If I turn to beer inventories, I\u2019d say we saw a pretty big increase in our distributors\u2019 inventories in the third quarter as they get closer to replenish to historic levels. We will most likely see that continue into the fourth quarter but we expect them to be at a pretty good back to normal trends by the end of the fourth quarter. So then we would expect as we go forward for more like shipments and depletions to be more in line with each other as we enter fiscal \u201816 and beyond. ", "End of Q&A", "Operator", "Thank you. I\u2019ll now turn the call to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks.", "Rob Sands", "Okay. Well, thanks everybody for joining our call today. Needless to say we are very pleased with our fiscal 2015 year-to-date results. Our beer business has tremendous momentum in the marketplace and continues to gain market share. Our high return investments in beer production capacity position us to support the significant growth of this business. We\u2019re growing EBIT in our wine business and our spirits business gained share across the product portfolio. And during our next quarterly call which is scheduled in early April, we will provide guidance for our upcoming fiscal year.

Following the prepared remarks, the call will be opened for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]", "I'll now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Patty Yahn-Urlaub", "Thank you, Laurie. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to Constellation\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal year end 2016 conference call. I\u2019m here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Klein, our CFO.", "This call complements our news release which has also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable, organic and constant currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results.", "Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP financial measures are included in the news releases or otherwise available on the company\u2019s website at www.cbrands.com.", "Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call.

Thank you.", "And now I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.", "Rob Sands", "Thanks, Patty. Good morning and welcome to our yearend call. Now before I begin the review of our accomplishments for fiscal 2016 and our plans for the coming year, I'd like to focus on the new initiatives disclosed within the press release issued earlier today.", "First, we announced that we are evaluating the merits of executing an IPO for a portion of our Canadian business. The consideration of this strategic action is the result of our ongoing efforts to identify value-enhancing opportunities for our shareholders and to strengthen the financial profile of our overall wine and spirits businesses.", "As we continue to transform the company, the focus and resources we put behind strategic initiatives to support sustainable value generating long-term growth are also evolving. This effort would provide better visibility to the Canadian business, which delivered excellent financial performance in 2016.", "Our Canadian business has a strong leadership team with extensive knowledge of the Canadian market. They market and sell a winning portfolio of brands and have a proven track record of successful innovation and new product development that resonates with Canadian consumers.", "Their size and scale across Canada includes eight wineries in key wine regions, approximately 1,700 acres of Canadian vineyards and a network of growers to support their Canadian produced brands. And they are the largest holder of independent retail licenses in Ontario with more than 160 wine rack stores.", "We are in the early process of evaluating an IPO of this business, and we plan to make a final decision later this calendar year, depending on market conditions. If an IPO is completed, the proceeds are expected to be used to manage debt and our other capital allocation priorities.", "This morning we also announced our plans to acquire The Prisoner Wine Company brands, a super luxury portfolio of five highly rated wines led by the largest brand, The Prisoner. Its other brands include Saldo, Cuttings, Blindfold, and Thorn, with overall volume for the portfolio reaching 175,000 cases in calendar 2015. The Prisoner is currently the number one super luxury red blend, growing in almost 30% in IRI channels at the $40 retail price point.", "Now similar to the Meiomi wine brand acquisition, the Prisoner acquisition aligns with our portfolio premiumization strategy and enables us to capitalize on US market trends that favor high end wine brands with accretive margin profiles. In particular, it strengthens our position in the dynamic and margin enhancing super luxury wine category and can be easily integrated into our existing portfolio of brands.", "So now let's turn our attention to some of our key achievements for the past year and great initiatives we have under way for fiscal 2017. Overall I am pleased with the significant accomplishments and the impressive financial results we achieved in fiscal 2016.", "This past summer we purchased the Meiomi wine brand, which is currently the fastest growing major brand in IRI channels in the $20 luxury price point. The brand delivered depletion growth of almost 60% in fiscal 2016, a trend which has accelerated since we first acquired the brand last summer. Its excellent margin profile is one of the contributing drivers of the margin expansion for the wine and spirits business in fiscal 2016.", "Meiomi Pinot Noir was one of the hottest wines of the year, listed as Number 20 in the Wine Spectator's Top 100 for 2015 and Number 1, that's good, on wine.com's Top 100 list, which is based entirely on consumer preferences. We believe the brand has plenty of room to continue driving healthy growth for our business.", "Last fall we entered the craft beer market with the purchase of Ballast Point, one of the most awarded major craft breweries in the industry. Ballast Point provides a high growth premium platform that is enabling Constellation to compete in the fast growing craft beer segment, further strengthening our position in the high end of the US beer market.", "In calendar 2015, Ballast Point posted depletion growth of more than 130% and sold nearly 4 million cases. This phenomenal level of growth is approximately three times that of any major competitor.", "Operationally, we selected a site and secured the land to construct a new state-of-the-art brewery in Mexicali, Mexico. Initially this brewery will we built to operate at 10 million hectoliters of production capacity with potential scalability to 20 million hectoliters and it will have similar technology and operational advancements as our Nava Brewery.", "And speaking of Nava, we successfully completed our first incremental 5 million hectoliter capacity expansion as planned by year end calendar 2015, and we are progressing with our plans to build out Nava to 27.5 million hectoliters by early calendar 2018.", "Now these investments in Mexicali and Nava will ensure that we have the capacity, quality, control and flexibility to meet expected demand for our iconic beer brands well into the future, and position us to capture the continued momentum and growth opportunities we see in the high end of the US beer market.", "Now organizationally we made key management changes across the business, strengthening the organization by fostering the continued growth and development of our people while insuring continuity to build upon our current success and drive the company's long-term growth strategies.", "Collectively these accomplishments, in conjunction with our excellent business performance, have helped to drive the appreciation of our stock, which remains one of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500 Index.", "Now let's move now to excellent business performance I just referenced as a critical component to our success. We'll start with the Constellation Brands beer business, which was the number one contributor to growth in the total US beer category last year for the third consecutive year, with most of our brands in the Mexican import portfolio posting record volumes in 2016.", "And Constellation was the leader and the number one share gainer in the high end segment of the US beer market in calendar 2015. More remarkably, our beer business growth has accelerated every year since 2010, with depletion trends exceeding 12% in fiscal 2016.", "I'd like to take a minute to share some of this past year's amazing accomplishments for our iconic beer brands and highlight the key initiatives we plan to execute during fiscal 2017 in order to maintain this excellent momentum.", "Let's begin with the clear heavyweights in our portfolio, Corona Extra and Modelo Especial, these brands are two of the hottest brands in the industry, and delivered 25% of US beer category industry growth last year.", "Our flagship Corona Extra brand has been the number one imported beer brand for almost 20 years, and today is the number five beer brand overall in the US industry. This brand sold more than 117 million cases in fiscal 2016, growing depletions almost 10% versus the prior year. This growth occurred across the country, as Corona Extra grew share in 49 out of 50 states and was the only top five US beer brand to grow share for the year.", "Corona Extra growth has been accelerating over the last five years, with the can launch accounting for about 1/3rd of the growth in fiscal 2016. The remainder of the phenomenal growth came from the increased distribution and velocity of the iconic Corona Extra bottles.", "In fiscal 2017, we expect to increase our media investment in Corona Extra while focusing the dollars against key time periods that include the NBA Finals and our 120 days of summer in order to maintain our leadership position during our most important selling season. We also plan to increase our digital investments, as we saw great success with the brand's social media activities last year.", "We believe there remains tremendous growth opportunity in Corona Extra cans, as depletions for this format increased more than 100% in fiscal 2016, but currently represent less than 6% of total brand volume.", "As such, we are investing more behind Corona cans to generate incremental awareness and consumer demand. You'll see a heavy media presence leading into key can holidays including Memorial Day, July 4th, and Labor Day.", "Now moving to Modelo Especial, this brand is stronger than ever as the fastest growing major beer brand in America. Last year the brand grew depletions more than 19% to surpass 70 million cases and $1 billion in sales.", "As a result, Modelo Especial was the number one dollar share gainer and is now ranked as the number eight beer overall in the US market in total dollar sales, up from the number nine position last year. The size of this brand has doubled in just five short years, and our goal is to keep this momentum going.", "In fiscal 2017 our biggest opportunity for this brand lies in expanding distribution, because despite being the number two import, Modelo currently has less than 50% distribution on most packages.", "We also see tremendous opportunity for this brand in the on-premise channel, where Modelo Especial increased more than 20% last year, with the draft format increasing almost 50%. Yet only about 30% of on-premise locations across the US carry Modelo Especial today. So we are focused on closing that distribution gap and increasing the momentum.", "Now for the sixth consecutive year, we are increasing our Modelo Especial investment in national, Spanish language TV, and digital, and we will be running new TV advertising throughout the entire year, increasing our spend on live sports by 50% and investing in heavily visible soccer broadcast properties.", "In addition, we are increasing our general market media by almost 40% across national TV and digital with high profile placements during the NBA playoffs and key NFL matchups. Together we expect these initiatives to position Modelo Especial for another great year of stellar growth.", "I also want to call out Corona Light, which remains the number one imported light beer by a large margin. Depletion growth on this brand has accelerated every year for the last five years, with depletions growing almost 8% in fiscal 2016.", "In fiscal 2017, we plan to build on the already successful Light Cerveza campaign with a new TV advertisement which will begin airing nationally this month.", "We have also added high profile live spots during NHL playoff broadcasts this spring and sponsorships of national major league baseball games on ESPN during the key summer holidays. This will be supplemented with an investment in social media.", "We are also expanding Corona Light draft by launching with several additional distributors. The Corona Light will continue to be a big point of emphasis, as depletions for this format increased more than 40% in fiscal 2016.", "As you are aware, the bench strength of our beer portfolio goes deeper than our biggest brands, part of what makes our collection of brands so powerful is the long-term potential of our smaller brands like Victoria and Pacifico that are currently outpacing category growth.", "And let's not forget about Ballast Point, a brewer known for unbridled innovation and outstanding quality, and one that gives our beer portfolio a leading position in the craft space that can be built upon in several ways.", "This year is to expand the Ballast Point distribution nationally, making it available in all 50 states. This along with successful new product launches is expected to drive the strong double-digit growth we are targeting in fiscal 2017.", "Overall, I am excited about the growth prospects for our beer business in fiscal 2017. As you can see, we have tremendous opportunity to grow the business organically through enhanced distribution and execution opportunities across the portfolio.", "As a result, we are targeting both net sales growth and operating income growth in the 14% to 17% range for our beer business in fiscal 2017, including the benefits from Ballast Point.", "From a brewery and operational perspective, in fiscal 2016 we achieved our key Nava Brewery performance goals for capacity utilization, quality, and cost. All areas of the brewery expansion are well under way, with overall project on schedule to be completed on time and within our budget.", "As we begin fiscal 2017, we'll be intensely focused on the continued expansion of the Nava Brewery to 20 million hectoliters. This capacity is expected to become fully operational within the next few months.", "As a matter of fact, we've already begun to run test brews and have all new packaging lines up and running in test mode to support this 20 million hectoliters of capacity.", "Now over the next few months we will continue to fine tune all the components necessary to successfully achieve this important milestone as planned. Within our existing capacity, we recently made our first brew of Modelo Especial Chelada at Nava with excellent results. With that accomplishment complete, we have now made brews of all of our products at this brewery.", "And, as many of you are aware, our third phase of expansion to 25 million hectoliters is our next critical milestone, and I am pleased to report that this work is proceeding as scheduled.", "I am proud of the fact that Nava is the newest and most advanced state-of-the-art brewery in the world and that our brewery team's capabilities and commitment to quality are unparalleled. These best in class credentials are what we plan to bring to our new Mexicali brewery.", "Mexicali is the ideal site for a sister brewery to Nava. The technology and skilled expertise we plan to put in place are designed to ensure the highest quality and consistency for our consumers, and we will continue to update you on the progress there.", "And now I'd like to focus on the operational results for our wine and spirits business. During fiscal 2016 we delivered overall earnings growth and margin expansion for our wine and spirits business.", "Our spirits portfolio produced solid results, and our Canadian wine business exceeded its financial goals, while outperforming the industry and growing market share for the year.", "Sales growth in the US benefited from organic volume growth and positive mix trends. We delivered exceptional results for our focus brands, which grew depletions 5% for the year and we are reaping the benefits of our targeted investments in these brands.", "As a matter of fact, many of our focus brands were included in our list of significant milestones and accomplishments for our overall wine and spirits portfolio for fiscal 2016.", "Seven of our brands were featured on Impact's annual Hot Brand list for wine and spirits, including Meiomi, which recently surpassed our very own Mark West as IRI's largest pinot noir for the current 12 week and 52-week periods, and Kim Crawford recently emerged as the number one sauvignon blanc in IRI channels.", "Our products were also called out in the Beverage Information Group's 2015 awards in which four of our brands achieved Fast Track status, recognizing their impressive growth. Three were named Rising Stars, including one of our newest brands, Tom Gore Vineyards, and six were listed as established growth brands, such as Mark West, Ruffino, SIMI, and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi.", "The Beverage Information Group also recognized SVEDKA Vodka as a spirits growth brand, which this year achieved its place as the number one imported vodka in the entire US. We plan to continue building on the success of some of our most recent new brands and line extensions to capitalize on the hottest trends in the market.", "Our newest red blend, Ravage, is a dark fruit forward red blend with structure and depth that has resonated well with consumers and will go national in September. Ravage Cabernet Sauvignon performed very well during our exclusive testing period with a major retailer throughout last year, and we are pleased to expand the brand to wider distribution this spring.", "We will also continue to support the growth of Tom Gore Vineyards, the farmer's wine, that meets consumers desire to know the people and places behind the products they choose.", "Some of our existing new line extensions include our Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Bourbon Barrel-Aged Cabernet, which boasts an impressively rich profile that comes from a unique aging process in bourbon barrels; and Ruffino's Sparkling Rose, which expects to capitalize on the success of our Ruffino Prosecco and the growing consumer taste for imported rose wines.", "For the year our spirits portfolio posted solid net sales growth of 6%, driven by the continued success of our flavor introductions for Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy, as well as SVEDKA vodka.", "Casa Noble almost doubled net sales this past year and tripled distribution in terms of number of accounts. We are upbeat about the future growth trajectory of this brand. In fact, we are putting resources behind Casa Noble to support what we believe is a compelling growth opportunity.", "Some of these investments include fresh packaging, a new marketing campaign, and continued cross promotion with Corona Extra during the Cinco de Mayo holiday season. Our marketing campaign, The Noble Pursuit, features digital spots that highlight the quality and heritage unique to this fine tequila.", "We also plan to continue supporting our number one imported vodka, SVEDKA with a new addition to our lineup of flavors, cucumber lime. SVEDKA has been very successful in launching highly targeted unique flavors that stand out from the vast options on the shelf today, and has proven it knows how to win in this space.", "We think cucumber lime will be a great addition to the track record of success, and the initial consumer response supports our optimism. From a strategic perspective in fiscal 2017, our goal for the wine and spirits business is to grow profits ahead of sales and improve margins, which is reflected in our 2017 wine and spirits guidance of mid single digit sales growth and mid to high single digits profit growth for the year.", "So what will be the enablers of this goal? We plan to capitalize on the market leading growth of our recent high growth margin enhancing wine acquisitions, Meiomi and The Prisoner. We will continue our targeted approach to investing in a subset of our focus brands in order to drive key brands that have scale, higher margin and the greatest growth potential.", "We remain committed to mix and margin accretive innovation and new product development and have several new products in the hopper, a few of which I just mentioned. And for the third consecutive year, we plan to execute price increases for select products within the portfolio.", "And finally, we plan to continue to optimize COGS through global blend management initiatives, productivity improvements, and lower grape costs. Overall we are committing people, technology, and resources to work with our wholesalers and retailers to execute growth for our wine and spirits business.", "In closing, it has certainly been another exciting year at Constellation. Our achievements are many and have driven a year of strong financial performance. In fiscal 2016, we delivered industry leading market results for our beer business, while continuing to enhance our operational platform in Mexico to support the growth of our iconic Mexican beer brands.", "Within our wine and spirits business, we maintained our focus on premiumization, innovation, and brand building which drove enhanced margins and earnings growth. We are very proud to have delivered another rewarding year of value to our shareholders, and I am pleased that our results can support a significant dividend increase in the coming year. Overall, we remain committed to challenging ourselves in order to optimize the business opportunities that lie ahead.", "With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David Klein who will review our financial results for fiscal 2016 and the outlook for fiscal 2017.", "David Klein", "Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Fiscal '16 was another very exciting year with strong financial performance in which we generated over $6.5 billion of net sales and 9% net sales growth. We expanded operating margins in both businesses and improved our consolidated comparable basis operating margin by more than 200 basis points.", "We increased consolidated EBIT 18% and comparable basis diluted EPS 22%, and we produced $1.4 billion of operating cash flow, an increase of 31%. The strong earnings and operating cash flow growth helped our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio finish at 3.8 times even as we made significant capital investments in our Mexican operations, acquired Meiomi and Ballast Point, and returned cash to shareholders with the initiation of a dividend and the repurchase of stock.", "We expect fiscal '17 to be another strong year, as we are targeting healthy net sales, EBIT, operating cash flow and EPS growth, while we continue to invest in our world class Mexican beer operating platform and increase our dividend per share by 29%.", "Given those highlights, let's look at fiscal 2016 performance in more detail, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results.", "Consolidated net sales on an organic constant currency basis grew 8% for the year. We continue to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business, with depletion growth coming in over 12%.", "Organic beer net sales increased 13% on organic volume growth of 11%. Ballast Point added $27 million of sales since joining our beer portfolio in mid December. Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 3%. This primarily reflects volume growth and favorable mix.", "As mentioned by Rob, Meiomi continues to demonstrate excellent marketplace momentum, as the brand generated $74 million of incremental sales since joining the portfolio last August.", "For the year, consolidated gross profit increased $373 million, up 14% with gross margin increasing 220 basis points. Beer gross profit increased $310 million, primarily due to volume growth, favorable pricing, and lower COGS, and our beer gross profit margin increased 300 basis points to 49%.", "Wine and spirits gross profit was up $63 million. This primarily reflects the benefits from the Meiomi acquisition and lower COGS. Wine and spirits gross profit margin increased 90 basis points to 42.2%.", "Consolidated SG&A increased $90 million. This reflects marketing investments made primarily by the beer business. Corporate expense was up due primarily to higher incentive compensation expense, an increase in payroll taxes associated with employee stock option exercise activity, and investments to support the growth of our business, including the establishment of our Chief Growth Officer function. Consolidated SG&A as a percentage of net sales remain constant at 17.5%.", "We continue to expand margins across the business, as consolidated operating income increased $283 million and consolidated operating margin improved 220 basis points. Beer operating margin increased 300 basis points to 34.9%, and wine and spirits operating margin improved 110 basis points to 24.8%. Equity earnings increased $5 million due largely to strong results for Opus One.", "Interest expense for the year was $314 million, down 7%. The decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates. At the end of February, our total debt was $8.1 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $8 billion, an increase of $812 million since the end of fiscal 2015.", "This primarily reflects funding for the Ballast Point and Meiomi acquisitions, partially offset by our free cash flow generation. Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio came in at 3.8 times at the end of fiscal '16 versus four times at the end of fiscal '15.", "Our fiscal '16 ratio does not reflect a full year EBITDA benefit for the Ballast Point and Meiomi acquisitions. Our effective tax rate for the year came in at 29.6%, which was essentially even with last year.", "Now let's briefly discuss Q4 results. Comparable basis diluted EPS came in at $1.19, up 16%. EPS growth was impacted by our tax rate, as our Q4 rate was 29.8% versus a 23.2% rate in Q4 last year, which reflected the benefit of certain foreign tax credits.", "Beer business results for the quarter finished strong, with organic net sales up 18% on organic volume growth of 14%. Net sales benefited from pricing and the overlap of certain sales adjustments recorded during the fourth quarter last year.", "Beer depletions for the quarter grew 13%. This factors in Ballast Point depletions since the transaction close date in mid-December and the corresponding period last year. Ballast Point added a little under 1 percentage point to our Q4 depletion growth rate.", "Beer operating income increased 29% primarily due to organic volume growth, favorable pricing and lower COGS, partially offset by increased SG&A largely attributed to higher marketing spend.", "Wine and spirits organic net sales on a constant currency basis were up 4% for the quarter, primarily due to volume growth. Wine and spirits operating income increased 14%.", "This reflected the benefit of the Meiomi acquisition, organic volume growth, and lower COGS, partially offset by higher marketing spend.", "Now let's review free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.", "For fiscal '16, we generated $522 million of free cash flow, compared to $362 million last year. Operating cash flow totaled $1.4 billion versus $1.1 billion for the prior year. This increase was primarily generated by the growth of the beer business.", "CapEx for fiscal '16 totaled $891 million compared to $719 million last year. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 246,000 shares of common stock for $34 million.", "Rob provided highlights of our agreement to acquire The Prisoner Wine Company brands. The cash paid at closing is expected to approximate $285 million.", "The transaction is expected to close by the end of April and to be $0.03 to $0.05 accretive to EPS for fiscal '17. This provides a good spot to move to our full year fiscal '17 P&L and free cash flow outlook.", "We are projecting our comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of 6.05 to 6.35. Our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release.", "The beer business is targeting net sales and operating income growth to be in the range of 14% to 17%. This includes the anticipated incremental benefit from the Ballast Point acquisition.", "We expect organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the 10% to 13% range. Our projections include 1% to 2% anticipated pricing benefit for our Mexican portfolio.", "We are pleased that our beer operating margin finished fiscal '16 just under 35%, which came in line with our most recent guidance. Our fiscal '17 beer segment guidance has us targeting a flattish beer operating margin versus fiscal '16.", "In fiscal '17 we expect to see positive operating margin benefits from product pricing, ongoing favorability from foreign currency and commodities, glass sourcing, and lower levels of finished goods purchased under the interim supply agreement with ABI.", "And while we are pleased with our progress on our expansion activities at Nava, we still have much to accomplish as we continue to bring online and optimize new capacity. Given these activities, we will continue to see a ramp-up in depreciation expense, line commissioning and optimization costs, and employee hiring. These costs along with marketing investments and the consolidation of Ballast Point are essentially offsetting the margin benefits I just outlined.", "Looking closer at depreciation and amortization expense for the beer segment, it totaled $62 million in fiscal '16. We expect that to increase by approximately 125% in fiscal '17.", "For the wine and spirits business, we expect net sales growth in the mid single digit range and operating income growth in the mid to high single digit range. This includes the anticipated incremental benefit from the Meiomi and Prisoner acquisitions.", "We expect organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid single digit range, with operating income growth targeted to be ahead of sales growth, as we are forecasting some mixed benefits.", "In addition, we expect our interest expense to be in the range of $325 million to $335 million. Our tax rate to approximate 29%, and our weighted average diluted shares outstanding to approximate $206 million. This does not assume additional stock repurchases.", "We expect fiscal '17 free cash flow to be in the range of $250 million to $350 million. This reflects operating cash flow in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, and CapEx of $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion.", "Based on the midpoint of our guidance, we are targeting double-digit growth in operating cash flow for fiscal '17. This benefit is being more than offset by the planned increase in capital expenditures, as our guidance includes approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion related to our beer operational expansion projects in Mexico.", "In the press release we issued this morning, we included an updated table summarizing the collective capital expenditure investments we are making in our Mexican operating platform and related timing. Overall there is no change to the total cost estimate related to these projects, and fiscal '17 and fiscal '18 still represent the peak spending periods for this activity.", "We increased our quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share for Class A stock and to $0.36 per share for Class B stock. This represents a 29% increase in our dividend rate per share. As a result, we expect approximately $320 million in dividend payments for fiscal '17.", "In closing, we are very pleased with our fiscal '16 financial performance and excited about the strong projected earnings and operating cash flow growth we are planning for fiscal '17.", "We continue to strengthen our financial profile, and have significant capital allocation flexibility as we remain focused on operating in our targeted three to four times leverage range.", "With that, we are happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.", "Dara Mohsenian", "Hey, good morning.", "Rob Sands", "Good morning, Dara.", "Dara Mohsenian", "I just wanted to flush out the reasoning for the potential Canadian wine IPO. It's a small piece of corporate EBIT. So it seems like it won't have much direct valuation impact. Is the motivation there more to potentially highlight the US wine business as undervalued here, or are there other reasons behind it?", "And any thoughts in general around the notion of going full monty and splitting up the entire wine and spirits business from beer down the road, it would be helpful for any commentary there? Thank you.", "Rob Sands", "Yes, so the Canadian IPO is really, assuming that it occurs, intended to achieve a number of things. Number one, we think that\u2019s sort of buried in the whole company in the wine and spirits division, it doesn't really get much visibility from a value perspective.", "And that if we treat it more as a standalone entity, the fact that it is a very high performing business in Canada will become a lot more visible, that's number one. So we think that that will be positively reflected in its valuation and our valuation overall.", "Number two, it's obviously also a capital allocation opportunity for us. As I said an IPO of a part of the - of the Canadian business will enable us to continue to manage our debt and keep it at the levels that we think are optimal for the company as we also embark on some of our other strategic initiatives that are driving our very positive results in the wine and spirits business.", "Meiomi is an example, Prisoner is an example, our investments behind driving premiumization in the portfolio with our other brands and our NPD initiatives. So we see the Canadian IPO as helping us to potentially achieve a lot of positive things.", "It is an interesting business, it\u2019s got strong growth. We built an improved market share in Canada. So we think that it represents in many respects a great standalone opportunity. As far as its implications as to our strategy for the rest of the wine and spirits business, there really is no implication there.", "The wine and spirits business - our wine and spirits business remains very strong, as you've seen in the results, we had fantastic leverage, P&L leverage in that business this year, we had tremendous margin expansion in that business.", "Even inclusive of Canada, which is a bit lower in margin than the overall business, we posted operating profit margin in the mid 20%s, which is fantastic for any business in any industry. A mid 20%s operating profit margin was the kind of leverage and growth and EBIT that we're getting in that business.", "So really no implications relative to the rest of the business. But we think that as I said as a standalone business it's a great opportunity from an investment point of view. So that's basically the thinking there.", "Dara Mohsenian", "Okay. That's helpful. And then on the beer margin side, the commentary made sense in terms of the puts and takes looking at the upcoming fiscal year. But it seems like some of those favorable items you mentioned like the glass efficiency, pricing, top line leverage, et cetera would be a lot bigger than some of the negatives that you mentioned, particularly given the strong gross margin momentum in Q4.", "So is the flat guidance just conservatism with greater uncertainty than you would usually have with the Nava ramp up. And can you give us a sense of some of the negatives you mentioned, like the Ballast SG&A, the higher marketing, and hiring?", "David Klein", "Yes, so generally, Dara, first of all there are a lot of moving parts as it relates to a buildup of our operating margin in the beer business, and in particular in the work that\u2019s being done at Nava.", "So as we said for the last year really, we're going to see headwinds in margin expansion at Nava as a result of incremental depreciation expense, line commissioning costs, employee hiring, as we bring capacity on, but we don't necessarily get the throughput through the facility.", "I would say that while we also are benefiting from stepping away from the ISA with ABI, as you'll recall we did extend although at a lesser amount in terms of case volume, we extended the ISA with ABI which dampened some of the near term margin upside that we may have otherwise seen.", "And then the last point really being Ballast Point. Now in terms of craft performers, Ballast Point is probably one of the best performing crafts from a financial profile perspective, but it still is dilutive to our overall operating margin of our beer business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.", "Russ Miller", "Hi, good morning, this is Russ Miller on for Nik. Could you more specifically compare the top line growth profiles of the US and Canadian wine businesses?", "David Klein", "Russ, we're struggling to hear you actually.", "Russ Miller", "I apologize. I was just wondering for more color, if you could compare the top line growth between the US and Canadian wine businesses?", "Rob Sands", "Compared to what, Russ? Higher in Canada than in the US.", "Russ Miller", "Okay. And then as a follow up, what are some of the key areas of focus for Bill Newlands as he takes over leadership of the wine and spirits business?", "Rob Sands", "Well, it's the things that have been driving and that drove the results this year. He's got to continue to focus on those same things. So it's all about like premiumization, it's about driving mix, it's about driving our higher margin brands and our newly acquired brands like Prisoner, like Meiomi, driving the organic growth of our really high margin focus brands, good examples being Kim Crawford, that's number one.", "NPD continues to be really important in the beverage alcohol business. NPD is providing almost all of the growth across any category in wine, beer, and spirits. Our beer business tends to be a little bit different than that because we happen to be in sort of in the main sweet spot of growth with our Mexican portfolio and our craft portfolio. But continuing to drive that NPD pipeline is again one of his main strategic initiatives.", "And as I said our new acquisitions, Meiomi, Mark West is only a few years old, Prisoner, these are all key to our premiumization and strategy and driving mix. And again, this is the sweet spot of growth in the beverage alcohol business. So it's pretty straightforward, and then it's you know, sort of I'd say day to day bread and butter stuff.", "COGS, control over COGS, costs and growth has been an important driver of our financial results there, as well as other expense items in the P&L. So he will continue to focus on those things as well.", "Good news is that he's doing a really great job and we're extremely optimistic obviously given our guidance for next year that we'll continue to be very successful in those areas.", "Russ Miller", "That's excellent. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.", "Judy Hong", "Thank you, good morning.", "Rob Sands", "How are you, Judy?", "Judy Hong", "So first on beer sales guidance for fiscal '17, I guess historically, it seemed like you were a little bit more conservative at the outset of the year in terms of looking at the beer depletion. And it looks like this time the 10% to 13% organic sales guidance for beer lapping some of the tougher comps in the back half seems actually not as conservative.", "So just wanted to understand maybe a little bit more just in terms of is it really the momentum behind all of your brand that you're seeing that gives you confidence, how big a factor would continue distribution gains on the cans be really a factor in terms of driving that sales growth momentum in '17 for your beer business?", "David Klein", "Well Judy, I think that it's of the things you mentioned around beer growth, it's both of those things. We think the brands continue to have very strong momentum. We continue to see that even as we're into the New Year in terms of IRI.", "There is a lot of distribution gain activity or a lot of space we can gain in terms of distribution in the coming year. We do expect continued growth of cans and again, our objective remains to drive our can volume up in aggregate into that mid-teens kind of range of total volume over time.", "I do want to address your point around the level of conservatism in our guidance. I would say that we've taken the same approach this year to guidance as we've used in the past. We're trying to give our best estimate as to where we think the business will land on the year, and I think that's reflected in the numbers that we produced.", "And again I think you do need to focus on the organic depletion number, which is - or the organic net sales number, which is the 10% to 13% because I think combined with our 1% to 2% pricing guidance, you get to a fairly respectable, but achievable volume number.", "Judy Hong", "Got it, okay. And then I guess the second question is around your capital allocation/acquisition strategy. So it seems like maybe every quarter or maybe just more recently we're getting a bit more just in terms of some of these acquisitions.", "Certainly in 2017, just given where your leverage level is, you also have a lot of dry powder in terms of continuing to either return cash to shareholders versus acquisitions.", "So is there a big pipeline in terms of these potential acquisitions that you see across both high end and craft spirits and beer side of the business? If those don't materialize would you be willing to return even more cash to shareholders in 2017? And what's embedded in terms of your guidance?", "David Klein", "So I would say, Judy, we are seeking all the time to methodically and consistently drive shareholder value. And so we look at all of the tools in the tool box that we have to do that. And yes, in some instances it's in acquisition like The Prisoner or Meiomi.", "And I would say that early returns on Meiomi and Ballast Point are very positive, from a shareholder return standpoint we expect to see the same results, from an execution standpoint, from The Prisoner transaction you can see that we do remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders as evidenced by a 29% increase in our dividend.", "And we will continue to look at share repurchases when we can stay within our leverage, our targeted leverage range, and we can be opportunistic in the market. And remember that the guidance that we gave assuming 206 million shares outstanding assumes no additional share repurchases at this point.", "Judy Hong", "Got it, okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.", "Bryan Spillane", "Hi. Good morning, everyone.", "Rob Sands", "Hi, Brian.", "Bryan Spillane", "So first just a housekeeping question. In terms of Prisoner, are you going to finance that with debt, with the revolver or just how are you financing that?", "David Klein", "Yes, that's a hard one because of the fungibility of cash. We will not be going to the market to borrow for - specifically for The Prisoner. We will take it off the revolver or cash on hand.", "Bryan Spillane", "Okay. And in terms of the accretion estimate that you gave, does that assume that you're just going to use cash in hand?", "David Klein", "The accretion estimate assumes kind of an average borrowing rate actually. So I guess you could imply the revolver from that when you're doing your math.", "Bryan Spillane", "Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then in terms of just sort of the flow of beer shipments for fiscal '17, given how fast the business is growing and the capacity constraints that you have, are we going to see maybe a different order pattern this year, where wholesalers are just going to build more inventory early in the season, so that you take less - take some pressure off the peak?", "David Klein", "I don't think you'll see anything different from previous years because we've had this pressure if you'll recall for the last couple of years. And we do a lot of work with our distributor partners to plan inventory levels so that we optimize our - the freshness of our beer, while making sure that we don't stock out at retail. So I don't think you'll see a dramatic shift from where we've been in the past.", "Bryan Spillane", "Okay. And then just one - just sneak one more in, just in terms of the Canadian partial IPO, had you considered or would you consider either just a tax free spin to shareholders and or an outright sale, like why a partial IPO versus maybe some of the other options that might also create value? Thanks.", "Rob Sands", "Yes, because call it a middle of the road approach, right. It gets us some and some, right. The Canadian business is a great business. It enables us to continue to have the Canadian business that they utilize it as distribution platform for our US brands. On the other hand, it will create more transparency into the performance of this business and therefore we think that it will be positive from a valuation perspective.", "And then of course there's the proceeds from the sale of a portion of the business, right, which as I said in my talk will enable us to continue to manage our debt levels appropriately and fits very nicely into our overall capital allocation strategy to enable us to do the things that David was just talking about, which includes some of our strategic initiatives, as well as David pointed out, methodically returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividend increases, as well as share repurchases.", "We did recommence our share repurchasing activity this quarter, and although we didn't include it in our guidance because we don't know what we're going to do necessarily because we act opportunistically there.", "It's certainly a major element of our capital allocation strategy, as I said to continue to return money to shareholders in both those matters, dividend increases and share repurchases. So it all fits together pretty nicely without sort of disassembling the business.", "Bryan Spillane", "All right. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.", "Vivien Azer", "Hi, good morning.", "Rob Sands", "Morning, Vivien.", "David Klein", "Hi, Vivien.", "Vivien Azer", "Just wanted to follow up on Bryan's question first, please. In terms of your inventory levels on the beer side, I was a little bit surprised actually not to see inventories build back up given what happened in the third quarter. So where are we in terms of your inventory levels right now?", "David Klein", "Our inventory levels from a days on hand, right, which reflect year-over-year growth, our inventory levels from a days on hand standpoint are consistent with where we've been in previous years at this point in time. And that's both within our network and at the distributors.", "Vivien Azer", "And is that a level that you're comfortable with or would you like to see that come up a little bit, given the momentum of the business?", "David Klein", "We're comfortable with that level.", "Vivien Azer", "Okay, perfect. Thank you. My next question has to do with Ballast Point. Can you comment at all on how much capacity there is, in particular at Miramar? And I ask it because given the fast top line growth, while the business is dilutive today, I suspect a lot of that has to do with the fact it's much more expensive to ship west to east than vice versa. So how are you thinking longer term about incremental capacity and where would you put that?", "David Klein", "So first of all I'll say that Miramar has capacity for about 10 million to 12 million cases. And then beyond that I think we've said in the past that, and Ballast Point has said this, Jim Buechler and his team have discussed looking for a location for an east coast brewery at some point in the future.", "Vivien Azer", "Is there any rationale to accelerating those plans to capture better margin given shipping rates?", "Rob Sands", "I would say - this is Rob. I would say that was being heavily investigated and pursued even prior to the acquisition. So the answer is that it is a strategic initiative as we speak.", "Vivien Azer", "Terrific. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA.", "Caroline Levy", "Thanks so much, good morning. A couple of questions. One, have you considered taking more pricing in beer given the capacity constraints and given the need to pull on the AB supply?", "Rob Sands", "Look, our position on pricing, our strategy remains the same. We really make our pricing decisions from a very granular perspective market by market, case by case, city by city. I think fundamentally the answer to your question is that we don't necessarily see anything on the horizon that dictates that we should be taking a different approach to pricing than we have in the past. It's going to be sort of based on what we think the market will allow and our competitive position.", "And we wouldn't use pricing to slow down the business and potentially damage the health of the brands. I can tell you that right now. We have, we believe the capacity necessary to meet the demand in the marketplace. But pricing is an important element of our growth strategy too. So we're going to continue to take the very balanced approach that we've been taking in the past.", "Caroline Levy", "Got it, okay. I know that you're looking to enforce some of your contracts a little more than you have in the past with distributors in terms of what kind of promotional spending they should do. And I'm wondering as you build up your 10% to 13% organic growth, how much is driven by expected better performance out of distributors?", "And sort of separate but the same, what growth rate are you looking for the Corona brand which had such an exceptional year last year, are you looking for high single digits still on Corona?", "Rob Sands", "So in answer to your first question, I think there is a bit of a misnomer there. We clarified some points in our distributor contracts and this and that recently. We talked about that at our GNS, our Gold Network Summit.", "It's really - I would say doesn't amount to much. We're not - I wouldn't call it enforcing our contracts in a particularly different manner. We continue to have the same approach with our distributors, which is very much a partnership approach, okay.", "Our proposition to our distributors is pretty simple, okay, which is like any smart business people, you should invest in the higher margin, higher growth parts of your business that can develop, you know, that's going to drive your margins in your business for the future, and we think that it's our portfolio that's the squeaky wheel that ought to get that grease. I mean, it's really as simple as that.", "And by the way, it's not a hard sell, okay? They all get it. They get it very easily and they can see it in their own financial results that the key in many respects to their future from any material perspective is in our portfolio, because the other large elements of their portfolio are flat to down, okay.", "So all of the action is in our brands and to some degree craft of course, which is - we're playing in that as well. So I don't think that there's anything particularly different going on with our distributor network. We're not insisting upon different terms than we have in the past in any material sense.", "And then your other question was product growth? We don't really break that out, but needless to say we're getting very strong growth in Corona and we continue that growth - continue to expect that growth to continue, right, driven by the can, driven by continued execution in the marketplace, even for 100% or a really well distributed brand.", "There remains to be distribution opportunity even for a brand like Corona when you look at the various SKUs and packs and this and that that we have. I mean, it's not 100% distributed in that regard.", "And then look, we're increasing our marketing activities ahead of the market very consciously because the most critical thing we have is to maintain the health of these brands. And therefore we think that continuing to increase our share of voice in building these brands is important.", "And then we also have great execution in that regard. I think that our advertising and our marketing in general and our strategy there is really working. So I mean I suppose you could be increasing bad advertising, which isn't going to get you anywhere. But we're increasing really, really good advertising that resonates with the consumer and we know that we get a fantastic return from this, so - because we measure it.", "Caroline Levy", "That's great, thank you very much. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Pivotal.", "Tim Ramey", "Hi. Good morning, thanks.", "Rob Sands", "Hi, Tim.", "Tim Ramey", "Your cash tax rate continues to be really low, and there's some downward movement in the book tax rate. I assume that's all timing differences on cash or tax depreciation. But if we think about the short-term two to three years out, how will those two numbers trend if you have any insight into that or does book move towards cash or does cash move towards book, I assume?", "David Klein", "Yes, so Tim, I think one of the issues that we wrestle with and you wrestle with and every corporation in America is wrestling with at the moment is all of the change that's happening both domestically and internationally from a tax policy perspective.", "And so you can see the benefits that we've had in recent years from certain foreign tax credits, as well as from the benefits of the tax treatment of stock option expense. And so that has helped push our number down in recent years, right.", "And then in terms of our cash versus book, I would say how that all resolves itself on an ongoing basis, I think is going to depend upon the changes in overall tax policy. I would say that we expect our cash taxes to remain in the low 20%s for the foreseeable future.", "Tim Ramey", "Okay. And just one other one on CapEx. I'm assuming that 2017 is the peak CapEx year, but it's not super clear what '18 should look like, and that's at least in the forecast horizon now, I assume it's lower than '17. Can you give any clarity on that?", "David Klein", "Yes, a little bit I would say that '17 and '18 as we said will continue to be the peak years. It's hard to really say at this point how things will flow between say '18 and '19 versus '17. So other than '17 and '18 will be our heaviest year, I'm reluctant to give any further guidance.", "Tim Ramey", "Terrific. Thanks for your help.", "David Klein", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein of Evercore.", "Rob Ottenstein", "Thank you very much and congratulations on a great quarter and a great year. A couple of questions. One, could you review for us your overall M&A strategy as it pertains between beer, spirits, and wine, and is it primarily opportunistic?", "Obviously there are strategic elements in terms of mix, but also is there any sense given that you are really the only total beverage alcohol play company in the US. Longer term would you be looking for a more equal mix in terms of the businesses between beer, wine, and spirits?", "Rob Sands", "Well, I think that the answer to your question is again, kind of some and some. It is obviously opportunistic in that you can't necessarily predict that there's going to be a willing seller of the things that we would like to acquire at the price that we would like to acquire it. So it is opportunistic in that regard.", "It's also strategic in that you know, clearly premiumization is an important part of the strategy whether it's wine, beer, or spirits. Margin enhancement is important to us as we look at various opportunities across the three segments, which goes back of course to the premiumization element of the strategy.", "And also obviously buying things that are sort of in the right place at the right time is important to us. You know, you look at wine, and clearly all the big growth in wine right now is in these higher price points like The Prisoner. You look at beer, it's almost the same in that it's better beer and higher price points that are driving that market.", "I think Ballast Point is a great example of that. I mean, that's like at the highest end of the beer market and it\u2019s got the fastest growth of any major craft brewer. It's almost a little contradictory in the sense that it would be the highest price and have the highest growth, but that's what makes it as attractive as it is.", "And then spirits is an interesting segment as well, and we made a couple of small acquisitions in the craft spirits space over the last 12 months. One called the Crafthouse Cocktails where we bought a minority interest in a brand that we think has the potential to be a very fast growing, high margin business.", "And then another bourbon brand recently again, that we think has the potential to be high margin, high growth too. But spirits I'd say is a little less developed from an opportunity point of view right now.", "The global spirits brand picture, I don't necessarily see us really playing in that. It's not of great interest. It's a market that's somewhat under pressure even in the segments that are growing pretty well, i.e., brown spirits and bourbon, but it's not really our sweet spot.", "But craft spirits much like craft beers is pretty interesting, but much more developmental in that the craft spirits business is much less developed than the craft beer, and the brands are even smaller, okay, than in craft beer. But we look at that segment too.", "I'd just add one other thing; our strategy is as it relates to capital allocation, acquisitions, really hasn't changed, okay. We're not on an acquisition bender or anything to that effect. We're going to continue to be highly strategic, look at opportunities as they arise as we always have.", "Obviously our strategy has changed a lot over the years. Now it's really about where we've taken advantage of opportunities. It's about buying sort of tuck-in, high growth, high margin, easy to assimilate type opportunities.", "So I guess as I said, the answer to your question is some and some. It's strategic, but it's also opportunistic. As we go forward here we intend to maintain, more importantly, our discipline on capital allocation, all of the things that we've said being a priority: reducing debt, returning dollars and value to shareholders, and making occasional strategic acquisitions as they come along, and maintaining our debt levels sort of in that three range where we said.", "Rob Ottenstein", "That's great. And just in terms of the targeted leverage ratio, I think you've said 3.5 to 4, given the outlook in terms of CapEx spending, as well as your very strong cash flows, how for the right acquisition would you be willing to go much over four times in the next year or so?", "Rob Sands", "We don't have any plans in that regard.", "Rob Ottenstein", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.", "Bonnie Herzog", "Good morning.", "Rob Sands", "Hi, Bonnie.", "Hi. I just have a question on or a follow on question on beer pricing. Clearly your net beer pricing was strong in Q4, and I guess I was hoping you could drill down between how much was from rate versus brand mix versus channel mix?", "And then assuming you saw positive channel mix, how much of that was driven by greater distribution in the high margin C-store channel?", "David Klein", "Yes, Bonnie, most of the pricing benefits that we've seen are really just overall price across the portfolio, across markets. And we would have expected it to be fairly heavy in the previous quarter because of the price increase that we implemented in October of this past year.", "Bonnie Herzog", "And then are you seeing increased penetration of the C-store channel, I know that's been a focus of yours as an opportunity.", "David Klein", "Yes, we continued to improve in that category.", "Bonnie Herzog", "Okay. And then maybe one final quick question on your Tail [ph] brands. I was just hoping you could give us a sense of how some of the Tail beer brands performed last year and then how meaningful you think these can become to your overall portfolio in the next couple of years? Thanks.", "David Klein", "Yes, we think that we will see growth in the mid to high single digits.", "Bonnie Herzog", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel.", "Mark Swartzberg", "Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys.", "Rob Sands", "Hi, Mark.", "Mark Swartzberg", "I guess, two topics; one beer, one Canada partial IPO one. On beer, David, really nice progression with the gross margin over the course of fiscal '16, about 300 bps up and then - on an annual basis, and then in the fourth quarter we saw it about 380 bps up.", "So I'm wondering if there's anything unusual in that progression and the progression which improved as the year progressed, as we think about how to balance the gross margin in our fiscal '17 estimates and the level of SG&A increases.", "And then kind of hand in hand with that, we saw like a 40% increase in SG&A in the quarter, $35 million. Can you give us some sense of what was in that $35 million number?", "David Klein", "Yes, so from a margin standpoint, the fourth quarter was really impacted primarily by price and mix. And I guess we would have again expected that because fourth quarter being when we implement our price increases, we would have benefited from the favorable FX and commodities environment, which we benefited from throughout the course of the year, but there was strong tail wind from that in Q4 as well. And your other question, Mark?", "Mark Swartzberg", "Was the - that benefit you just described in the fourth quarter was in a sense eaten up by a relatively large increase in SG&A, $35 million, 40% increase. Can you just speak to what was in that $35 million number?", "David Klein", "So in terms of total SG&A, we would be - we saw increases in marketing. We saw increases in compensation expense. We had some increases that would have come into our number on a year-over-year basis as a result of the Ballast Point acquisition.", "Mark Swartzberg", "Got it. Okay, great. And then with the Canada partial IPO, I mean kind of the elephant in the room of course is partial and IPO and Canada being this continent called North America like, is this the beginning of something larger, and I realize you're not going to say oh yes, we intend to IPO our larger wine and spirits business eventually. But is it unreasonable to think that this creates optionality for you, should you decide to ever go down that road?", "And then hand in hand with that, because it is obviously a leading question, it seems to me that all the merits that you're offering for Canada in terms of how it's performing and so forth, are merits that you could offer for your US business even to a greater degree. So just help me with kind of what's wrong with that thinking or what's right about that thinking?", "Rob Sands", "Yes, I think that what's right about - we'll start with what's right about it, okay. Just to be nice. I think what's right about it is yes, this kind of thing does provide a greater degree of optionality for us of which it's precisely that, optionality. We don't - other than what we currently have planned, we don't necessarily - we're not planning anything else, but clearly it gives us more optionality.", "As it relates to the rest of the business, I think that you really can't draw any implications from that. We kind of look around the business and we see what we think are the opportunities, and again, this fits into our whole capital allocation strategy, right, managing debt, being able to return money to shareholders through dividends, stock repurchases, as well as being able to make some strategic acquisitions from time to time.", "So we're just trying to be prudent in a number of - I'd say we're trying to be transparent, we're trying to show where we think that there's value that isn't necessarily recognized, and then we're also trying to be prudent in our - I'll say, use of capital and where that capital comes from. Does that make sense?", "Mark Swartzberg", "Great. Yes, it makes a ton of sense and really, I don't think anyone was looking for a Canada IPO, so kind of it's impressive to see you guys kind of offering that optionality. So thank you, Rob.", "Rob Sands", "Well, appreciate that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi. Actually this is Stephanie on for Bill. I just have a quick question, and I apologize if I missed it. Did you give what's the sales base for the Prisoner acquisition was?", "David Klein", "No, we didn't other than to say the Prisoner brands themselves in aggregate represent about 175,000 cases.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And then maybe you could kind of give a little bit of an update on the Meiomi acquisition that you did and how it\u2019s tracking along with your plans, and any opportunities you may have with that going forward?", "David Klein", "I would say from my perspective Meiomi continues to track actually better than our original expectations when we did the acquisition. The most recent 12 weeks or at least the 12 weeks in IRI that coincided with the end of our fiscal year had it up, the brand up 88%.", "And as we said when we originally spoke about the transaction, it has one of the best gross profit margin profiles within our entire wine portfolio, and we've continued to see that and in fact improved upon that a little bit. So we're very pleased with how we've progressed with Meiomi.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great. And then just a follow up, so looking at Prisoner, they would have kind of like a similar margin profile, kind of higher than the corporate average, but not so high as Meiomi, is that the right way to look at it?", "David Klein", "That's the right way to look at it. It probably does come - actually line up fairly well with Meiomi.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Got it. Well, thanks so much for the color.", "Rob Sands", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of John Faucher of JPMorgan.", "Peter Graham", "Hi, this is Peter Graham on for John. Just one quick question from me. As you guys build up and acquire more wine assets are you going to need to add more capacity similar to what you guys did on the beer side? Thanks.", "David Klein", "We wouldn't expect to. Our intention for the business is to continue to milk the low end of the portfolio and to drive growth and increase profitability at the high end of the portfolio.", "So we will continue to have that consistent capital requirement in our wine business that we've seen over the past several years, but we just - our intent is to make it work harder.", "Peter Graham", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. I'll now return the call to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks.", "Rob Sands", "Okay, well thank you, everyone. As we wrap up our discussion of the fourth quarter and FY16 results, I want to reiterate how pleased I am with our year end success and how we are positioned for continued growth and financial strength in fiscal '17.", "As our guidance shows, we are confident in our ability to continue achieving growth and we are firm in our commitment to deliver shareholder value. We look forward to the next time we speak with you in early July when we will share the results of our first quarter of our new fiscal year.", "But before then we hope you'll pick up a few of our fine products for your spring celebrations, including Cinco de Mayo and Memorial Day weekend. And speaking of Cinco, you can look for us at the New York Stock Exchange on May 5th as we officially kick off our Cinco Happy Hour by ringing the closing bell.

[Operator Instructions]", "I'll now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Patty Yahn-Urlaub", "Thank you, Maria. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to Constellation\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2017 conference call. I\u2019m here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Klein, our Chief Financial Officer. This call complements our news release which has also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP comparable, organic and constant currency basis.

This has been our practice for the last several quarters and helps us end our call on schedule.", "Thanks in advance and now here is Rob.", "Rob Sands", "Thank you Patty and good morning, and welcome to our discussion of Constellation\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2017 sales and earnings results. We are off to a great start to our new fiscal year with sales and earnings up double digits. Across the business, we\u2019re seeing the results of our efforts to drive consumer demand for premium products through best in class marketing and sales execution while improving margins through financial discipline and a focus on core premium products. This combined with the successful integration of and growth from our recently acquired brands provides a healthy foundation for achieving our fiscal 2017 objectives. Our beer business continues to deliver industry-leading results while expanding their operational footprint with planned capital investments in Mexico. During the quarter, the beer business generated depletion growth of almost 10% and was the number one share gainer in the high-end segment of the US beer business. Constellation's beer portfolio lead volume gains amongst US brewers contributing almost 20% of category dollar growth during the quarter as each brand in our Mexican beer portfolio grew across most channels and packages. Corona Extra and Modelo Especial remained two of the hottest brands in the US beer industry and held category leading positions as the number three and number two players respectively among overall brand share gainers. These results are due in part to focused market execution as well as optimization of key marketing and advertising initiatives.", "We launched fresh new Spanish and English language national television advertising for the Corona Extra brand and can format including the brand's first ever boxing TV ad. New national TV advertising was also launched for Modelo Especial in English and Spanish, and for the Modelo Especial Chelada in Spanish, both of which continued to have double-digit growth and are among the fastest growing brands in the category. Our new Pacifico 24 ounce can format is the number one new import so far in 2016, and we are supporting the brand by expanding targeted television advertising. Pacifico grew depletions more than 15% for the quarter. And last but certainly not least, let\u2019s not forget about Ballast Point, which continues to be the fastest growing major craft brand in the US posting depletion growth of more than 60% in the first quarter. As you know our plan for Ballast Point this year is to expand distribution and make the brand available in all 50 states. And to-date, we now have distribution in more than 40 states and expect to complete our overall goal sometime before calendar yearend. This distribution push along with successful new flavor and style launches is expected to deliver the strong double-digit growth we are targeting for Ballast Point in fiscal 2017. It was recently announced that we plan to establish a Ballast Point Brewery in Virginia. This will allow us to develop an East Coast presence to provide the best quality, freshest craft beer to all of our customers.", "I\u2019d now like to take a minute to discuss recently published IRI and Nielsen consumer takeaway data for our beer business as there seems to be significant discussion and debate related to the growth trends for some of our brands. First, IRI channels represent about 50% of our overall beer business at retail and therefore provide only a partial picture of the brand and portfolio performance outside of the sales, shipment, and depletion results we report every quarter. Within IRI channels, over the last quarter, we\u2019ve seen significant variability from week to week. Much of this relates to year over year timing and selling day comparison issues for important holidays during the quarter including Cinco and Memorial Day. We saw some impact from our fiscal 2016 fourth-quarter recall of certain Corona Extra packages which created temporary product shortages in select areas. We also experienced pockets of poor weather, especially in the Northeast, and we\u2019re cycling very strong Corona Extra can growth following last year's first quarter intro of the can format for this brand.", "Despite these temporary headwinds, our recent brand health assessment for Corona Extra indicates that consistent or increased drinking on key brand health scores nationally since fiscal 2016. While consumer takeaway is a standard measurement, depletions represent our entire business are an even more comprehensive indicator of growth in health. I'm very proud of our nearly double-digit beer depletion growth trend for the first quarter given some of the factors I just mentioned. And preliminary beer depletion results for the month of June are progressing in line with our forecast. We anticipate similar timing issues around the upcoming key holidays in the second quarter related to the July 4 and Labor Day weekends. Operationally, during the quarter, we completed a significant expansion milestone at Nava by doubling the size of the brewery that we acquired and bringing annual production capacity to 20 million hectoliters. All support areas are in place for this added capacity including packaging, utilities, warehouse, and rail infrastructure. As many of you are aware, the expansion of the Nava brewery to 25 million hectoliters is our next critical capacity milestone, and I'm pleased to report that this work is proceeding as scheduled. In addition, we've officially broken ground at Mexicali and although this project is in the early phase, it is also progressing as planned. Finally, we recently fired up our second furnace at our Nava glass plant and expected it will be producing glass shortly. As a reminder, it takes several months for a new furnace to ramp up in order to produce optimal capacity.", "And now I would like to focus on the operational results for a wine and spirits business. During the quarter, our wine and spirits business grew earnings and expanded margins while successfully integrating and growing our newly acquired premium wine brands Meiomi and The Prisoner which posted IRI dollar growth of about 90% and 30% respectively. Since the acquisition of The Prisoner, Constellation has gained 2 share points in the IRI luxury plus segment extending the lead in our number one luxury plus position. Constellation is now ranked number three in super luxury wine at the greater than $25 retail price point. The US wine business posted strong sales growth and gained IRI dollar share driven by our core focus brands where we are building momentum across multiple price segments. Let me provide a few examples, in the IRI $20 plus luxury and super luxury price segments combined, Meiomi is not only the largest Pinot Noir but also the largest dollar share gainer for the entire quarter. Kim Crawford is the number one Sauvignon Blanc in the IRI super premium segment and posted dollar sales growth of more than 20% during the quarter. Clos du Bois is the number one chardonnay in the IRI premium segment, and Black Box is the leader in the fast growing premium box segment.", "In aggregate, our Focus Brands grew depletions at 12% for the quarter. Our innovation platform is also gaining traction thanks to new margin enhancing offerings like the Robert Mondavi Private Selection Bourbon Barrel Aged Cabernet, SVEDKA Cucumber Lime, Ruffino Sparkling Ros\u00e9 and Ravage Cabernet Sauvignon. The Canadian business delivered a solid quarter posting mid-single digit net sales growth while continuing to gain market share across both the import and domestic line segments. Overall, our first quarter wine and spirits results are a testament to our ability to achieve our goal of growing profits ahead of sales and improving margins. So what are the key enablers? We are reaping the benefits of our targeted investments for a subset of our focused brands in order to drive key brands that have scale, higher margin and greater growth potential. We remain committed to mix and margin accretive innovation and new product development have several new products in the hopper a few of which I just mentioned. We continue to optimize COGS through global blend management initiatives, productivity improvements and lower grape costs. We are capitalizing on the market leading growth of our margin enhancing wine acquisitions Meiomi and The Prisoner and we have recently made some leadership changes within wine and spirits to enable a stronger, more competitive business. ", "Now before I turn the call over to David, I would like to touch on two more high-level topics of interest for our business. So first is related to the exploration of a possible IPO of our Canadian business discussed last quarter. Our evaluation of this strategic option continues and we plan to provide you with an update as soon as possible. Since this evaluation is ongoing there is not much else to add at this time. The second is the recent referendum in favor of the UK exiting the European Union. As a reminder, Constellation is primarily a US business. Our sales outside the US represent about 10% of our total consolidated sales and are primarily related to our Canada business. As such, our exposure to European markets in particular is limited and a strong dollar generally benefits us financially. In closing, our first-quarter results have set the stage for fiscal 2017. We are off to a very positive start for the year gaining market share across our beer and wine businesses. We have been working diligently to build a solid and sustainable foundation of operational excellence, financial strength and innovation. And we expect to continue to execute on these areas throughout the remainder of the year.", "With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David who will review our first-quarter financial results.", "David Klein", "Thank you Rob and good morning everyone. On the last call we provided guidance which represented an impressive mid teens EPS growth. I\u2019m happy to report that we\u2019re steadily executing against our plans. Comparable basis diluted EPS for the quarter came in at $1.54, up 22% putting us on a path to achieve our full-year comparable basis diluted EPS goal of $6.05 to $6.35 per share. Let's look at Q1 fiscal \u201817 performance in more detail where I\u2019ll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Organic beer net sales increased 15% primarily due to organic volume growth of 12% and favorable pricing. Beer depletion growth for the quarter came in at almost 10%; this includes Ballast Point depletions for the quarter and in the corresponding period last year. Excluding Ballast Point, depletions for our Mexican portfolio grew 9%. Beer shipment volume for the first quarter generally runs ahead of depletion volume as distributors build inventory for the summer selling season. This year, we also benefited from a shift in shipment volume from Q4 fiscal \u201816 into Q1 fiscal \u201817 related to the beer recall we discussed last quarter.", "Distributor inventory days at the end of Q1 fiscal \u201817 were fairly level with the prior year quarter. Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 3%; this primarily reflects volume growth and favorable mix for the segment driven by solid financial results for the organic US wine business in the quarter. Beer operating margin increased 80 basis points to 35.6%, this reflects benefits from pricing, foreign currency and timing of marketing spend for our Mexican portfolio. As expected these positive factors were partially offset by higher COGS, including increased depreciation as additional capacity came online, SG&A investments and the consolidation of Ballast Point. If you exclude the marketing timing benefit, beer operating margins for the quarter would have been flattish to up slightly. I\u2019d also like to note we've reduced the level of product we received under the interim supply agreement with ADI as Nava has reached the 20 million hectoliter capacity milestone. Wine and spirits operating margin improved 160 basis points to 23.3%. the increase was primarily related to the benefit from the Meiomi acquisition.", "Interest expense for the quarter increased 9%, primarily due to higher average borrowings. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $8.1 billion, an increase of $143 million since the end of fiscal \u201816. This increase primarily reflects funding for The Prisoner acquisition, which closed at the end of April, partially offset by our free cash flow generation. Our net to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio came in at 3.7 times at the end of Q1 fiscal \u201817 versus 3.8 times at the end of fiscal \u201816. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q1 does not yet reflect a full year EBITDA benefit from the Ballast Point, Meiomi and Prisoner acquisitions. Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 31.6%, which is essentially even with Q1 of last year. We anticipate that our Q2 fiscal \u201817 effective tax rate will be similar to the Q1 rate. However, we continue to expect our full year fiscal \u201817 effective tax rate to approximate 29%. ", "Now let's review free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For Q1, we generated $177 million of free cash flow compared to $76 million for Q1 last year. Operating cash flow totaled $346 million, up 68%. This increase was primarily driven by our earnings growth. CapEx for the quarter was $169 million compared to $130 million for Q1 last year. While CapEx was up for the quarter, we still have significant spending plan for the balance of the year as our full-year CapEx guidance of $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion remain unchanged. As a reminder, this guidance includes approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion related to our beer business operational expansion projects in Mexico. We continue to expect fiscal \u201817 free cash flow to be in the range of $250 million to $350 million. This reflects operating cash flow in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion and the CapEx spend that I just outlined.", "Moving to our full year fiscal \u201917 P&L outlook, we continue to project our comparable basis EPS to be in the range of $6.05 to $6.35. Our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments which are detailed in the release. The beer business continues to target net sales and operating income growth in the range of 14% to 17%. We also continue to expect organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the 10% to 13% range. This includes 1% to 2% of anticipated pricing benefit for our Mexican portfolio. For the wine and spirits business, we continue to expect net sales growth in the mid-single digit range and operating income growth in the mid-to-high single digit range. In addition, we continue to project organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the low-to-mid single digit range with operating income growth targeted ahead of sales growth as we are forecasting some mix benefits. In closing we are off to a great start to the year and on track to achieve our financial performance goals for fiscal \u201817. While we still have much to accomplish with our Mexican brewing operations, we are excited that we achieve the critical milestone by reaching the $20 million hectoliter capacity mark at Nava.", "With that Rob and I are happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Market.", "Nik Modi", "Just a quick question on the wine business. The depletion growth looked pretty good on the organic side, and I know you talked about a lot of brands growing, but what exactly is underpinning some of the improvement there. Maybe you can share some of the early things that Bill Newlands is doing in that business. And then just a quick follow-up, just wanted to get an update on how the Kim Crawford test is doing out in Texas, I believe you guys are spending some marketing dollars behind that brand, and just wanted to get kind of an update on that? Thanks.", "Rob Sands", "Yes so, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, it's really a subset of our Focus Brand that are driving that depletion growth that is excluding our newly acquired brands, Meiomi and The Prisoner, but we've got a few brands right now that are really on fire like Black Box, Clos du Bois is up heavy double-digits. Kim Crawford is up very significantly and even our largest brand which is Robert Mondavi, the Woodbridge brand is up very significantly on a very large base. The Mark West brand, the Pinot Noir brand that we acquired a few years ago is also up very sharply. So, I guess that we are - it\u2019s fortunate that we can report that our brand portfolio includes some really hot brands at the moment. What was your question about Texas, Nik?", "Nik Modi", "Just the Kim Crawford tests, just looking at how that's progressing.", "Rob Sands", "That test has gone extremely well, I think that the test has demonstrated that the brand responds and performs very well to advertising. And consequently, we will be increasing our advertising for this brand. And the test was basically - the test basically demonstrates that\u2019s an investment that will more than pay back, so we're pretty excited about that as well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research Group.", "Tim Ramey", "You mentioned the FX impact, and I think of all the things that you buy from other places in the world not just beer, but barrels and so on. We've had some pretty substantial moves particularly against the peso, I wonder if you could kind of give us any quantification about what that contribution might look like now?", "David Klein", "Yes, so Tim, as it relates specifically to the peso, about 20% of our COGS for beer are denominated in peso. And so, clearly as the dollar strengthens, we get a benefit, what I\u2019ll say though is that we also as we sit here today we are about 70% to 75% hedged on our exposures against all currencies for the remainder of the fiscal year. So, the strengthening dollar clearly benefits us, but some of that benefit is muted by the hedges that we have in place.", "Tim Ramey", "Okay, and Rob maybe you're always good at commentating on the kind of the big picture in wine, I think the category is performing well and you\u2019re outperforming the category. How do you see that performing for maybe the 12 to 18 months time horizon?", "Rob Sands", "I thing actually the category as you mentioned has accelerated about lately and therefore I would say that it's very robust. I would say that trading of at premiumization in the category is probably stronger than ever, okay and things have really kind of shifted, maybe two or three years ago we would have been talking about the $8 to $10 to $12 segment really being the hottest segment in the industry, but I would say that that shifted up to even the $15 and $20 segments hence are interested in brands like Meiomi and Prisoner and that segment because I think we really see the future continuing to favor the premiumization and trading up even into these more expensive categories. And then as it relates to our own business, we\u2019re constantly working on positioning our portfolio, okay to take advantage of those trends. And I think that we\u2019ve very successfully done that and have great brands in all of these hot price segments and categories, and it's not just price segments, right, it\u2019s categories.", "Perfect example being Pinot Noir, okay, we are a leader in Pinot Noir today and Pinot Noir is just an extremely hot varietal, and I would say that the good news there is that I would say we expect it to continue to be a hot varietal for, you know, well into the future in that, it is not a trendy kind of a thing that will be fleeting in there of course Pinot Noir is one of the noble varieties and has always been highly sought after. And we - and as I said we get the hottest brand, red blends continue to be hot as you know we've got hot brands in the red blend category, I mean, Prisoner I mean is a perfect example of that albeit a newly acquired brand but you only have to go and sort of see what people are drinking in any major metropolitan area or talk to people and Prisoner is the hottest brand in its price point and has taken advantage of that as well. And again, I don't think that's particularly trendy and that it\u2019s gotten fantastic scores and it\u2019s considered to be, you know, let me put it this way, a real fine wine, so this is basically the answer to your question, Tim.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.", "Judy Hong", "So, first of all in terms of the beer depletion, Rob as you pointed out pretty choppy weather and some other factors in the first quarter. So when you looked at your 9% depletion for the core organic, you can kind of have a sense of how much some of these one-off factors dampened that growth. And then I think you said June depletions are progressing. Can you give us a little bit more color just in terms of what you're seeing in June, I mean some of the Nielsen data actually looked pretty strong as we\u2019ve seen in the last few weeks? So maybe just a little bit more color just on the June trend. And then as it relates to your full year depletion growth, it seems like you\u2019re kind of still expecting relatively healthy organic sales growth for your core business, any sort of turnaround on the competitive environment as you think about the marketplace? Thanks.", "Rob Sands", "So, look it's hard to get into specific numbers, okay on what the growth would have been had these factors not affected us. But as I said, there were two or three factors, I\u2019d say, first quarter was kind of not a great quarter for the beer business, the beer category in general. I mean that said, our beer portfolio grew a little bit shy of 10%, which is an outstanding result on a relative or comparative basis. Yes, there were a few things that affected our business, which I talked about, the Recall affected it for sure, hence we would have done better in the first quarter had that not been the case. The overlap in the intro [ph] was a factor. There was definitely some promo activity in first quarter last year, which was not duplicated this year again due to some packs not being in supply during that period.", "And then I guess to your point, you can see all that kind of clearing itself up by simply looking at the June IRI trends, which I think are reflective of the overall health of the business. So, we have no concerns whatsoever about the brand health of the import portfolio or Corona period. So we fully expect to be on our forecast for the year for the portfolio and that's our import portfolio, right. Ballast Point, we're not even talking about that because the growth is so high that one can even say. It's the fastest growing beer in the entire craft segment in the entire US on what's getting to be a very big base, okay. I mean, we can't even talk about double-digit growth because it's so high. It's triple digit sometimes.", "Judy Hong", "Right. Okay. That's helpful. And then, David, just in terms of the phasing of, I guess, the beer gross margin progression for the balance of the year, as we think about certainly Nava, having now the 20 million hectoliter capacity, I think you have one more furnace in Nava up and running as well, but obviously some of the startup costs on the Nava side, so just, can you just help us understand sort of the phasing of gross margin. Is second quarter kind of more negatively impacted as it's more of a heavy volume quarter or how we should think about the phasing?", "David Klein", "Yes. So in the first quarter, we benefited from pricing in general, which somewhat offset COGS increases which were driven by increased depreciation. We did receive some benefits from FX, but probably the biggest driver in the quarter was the timing of marketing spend and now, I'm talking about operating margins, right, so we'll see that spend come back as we progress in the fiscal year, which will have a bit of a dampening effect on the margin. So we still expect flat margins roughly year-over-year and we're just -- we're pleased with the progress we're making in terms of margin expansion in getting the Nava facility functioning at 20 million hectoliters.", "The other comment I want to make Judy relates to glass. So, yes, we've fired up the second furnace at Nava. We won't be producing glass out of that facility really until the end of July and then even when that happens, the facility itself won't be producing at what we would expect our acceptable levels of utilization for many months. It takes a long time to get the furnaces functioning in a way that we'll be happy with. So, I would say that the benefit from that furnace really won't show up until the back half of this year, if it shows up this year at all.", "Judy Hong", "Got it. Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohseniun of Morgan Stanley.", "Dara Mohseniun", "Good morning. Rob, I was hoping you could review for us your cash flow priorities in terms of M&A versus returning cash to shareholders, given some of the rumors in the press lately and is M&A a big focus at this point, and what range or size of deal are you generally comfortable with from an M&A standpoint? Thanks.", "Rob Sands", "Yes. So I would say that our capital priorities haven't changed at all. They sort of remain number one at keeping our debt levels in that sort of mid-3 to 4 range, where we actually are at the current time. Returning dollars to shareholders continues to be a big and important focus for us. As you know, we did increase our annual dividend at the end of the year and we have made some stock repurchases. So, we continued to prioritize that as a key priority. And then, as we've said in the past, we\u2019ll continue to look at and potentially make selective acquisitions of things like Meiomi, Prisoner as we go on. So I think that those kind of things are somewhat reflective of being tuck-in type acquisitions of the things that we would look at and I would say that that strategy is working very well.", "And then I think to your question about the magnitude, I think that goes back to my first point relative to maintaining our debt levels in that sort of 3 to 4 times, okay, we will be, I would say, guided in terms of magnitude by that priority and then, as I mentioned in my script, we continue to evaluate the Canadian IPO, right, but that's a disposition. So if we were to complete that, that will actually bring in cash, right. So we are being, I would say, pretty judicious in terms of how we\u2019re managing the whole capital allocation process and our priorities. So I think that we've got, we\u2019ve struck a really good balanced there, let me put it that way.", "Dara Mohseniun", "Okay, that's helpful. And then beer pricing was strong in the quarter at 3%, obviously part of that is balanced mix, but still strong on an underlying basis at a time when industry discounting looks like it\u2019s picked up. So I was just hoping you could review if you are comfortable on the 2% pricing range going forward for your business and anything you\u2019re seeing from a competitive standpoint in the industry?", "Rob Sands", "Yes. Our position on pricing and our plans haven't changed at all, and we don't really -- yes, there has been some competitive activity, but I would say that there is really nothing indicative that from a competitive point of view that that's really changed very significantly. I don't think anybody is like falling off a log and changed their general modus operandi in the industry general, that\u2019s sort of our view of things.", "Dara Mohseniun", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore.", "Robert Ottenstein", "Great, thank you very much. Thank you and congratulations on a terrific quarter. So two questions. One, if you look at, and I know it's tough to get to, so just I appreciate any kind of way to think about our estimates. So if you look at roughly 9% depletion growth on the Mexican brands, can you break out roughly what percentage of that is coming from Mexican American consumers and what percent will be coming out from the general market?", "David Klein", "So Robert, the way we think about it when we look at our FY17 numbers, we think that's about 40% of our year-over-year growth will come from increasing distribution in the business. So this doesn't get to the demographics, but this is how we think about our numbers. So about 40% coming from growing distribution, about 10% coming from pack innovation during the fiscal year and then the remainder is really driven by demographic shifts like Hispanic and millennial consumers, but we also have included in that remaining 50%, other environmental factors. So it gets a little bit money, but when we\u2019re putting our plans together, that's how we think about it.", "Robert Ottenstein", "Well, in terms of the 40%, would it be fair to say that most of that 40% would be the general market because presumably Modelo Especial is pretty well distributed in Mexican-American accounts?", "David Klein", "Yes. Some of the distribution growth though isn't necessarily just getting APAC into individual stores. It's getting different pack sizes into individual stores, which will take place across all of the retail establishments.", "Robert Ottenstein", "Got it. And then my second question, Rob, as you look out at the -- on the environment or the opportunity set for potential wine acquisitions and the possible targets, how does that look today and how does that compare with what you may have seen a few years ago? Is it more target rich environment, less, are you excited about what's out there in terms of what you can bring in to the portfolio and just kind of give us a sense of what the landscape looks like?", "Rob Sands", "Yes. I don't think that we see anything that\u2019s largely different than what has been the case over the last several years, especially for perhaps the kind of things that we might be interested in. It really remains a one-off kind of opportunistic situation. There has been sort of a lot of activity in sort of the smaller end of the market, which meaning small deals that we don't really plan because they wouldn't be particularly significant or material to us. But of the kind of brands that we might be interested in, I would say that there is no fundamental change in the activity in that arena.", "Robert Ottenstein", "So I mean perhaps another way of asking is just kind of for modeling purposes or just thinking about it, should we think about maybe one deal a year, averaging out to that obviously it\u2019s opportunistic?", "Rob Sands", "It\u2019s totally unpredictable.", "Robert Ottenstein", "Got it. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.", "Vivien Azer", "Hi, good morning. So two questions on Ballast please. On the depletion growth that you guys noted, would it be possible to unpack that and give us a sense for how much distribution added to that?", "David Klein", "We've grown distribution about 40% since the time we took on Ballast Point, I think we\u2019re at about 20 ACV and it's -- however, we\u2019re still seeing growth in our existing markets in our existing stores. So I would say we\u2019re seeing growth in big markets like California as well as growing incremental markets across the US.", "Vivien Azer", "That's great. And as you target the full national distribution by the end of the calendar year, how would you anticipate your ACV tracking with that?", "David Klein", "Yes. I think coming back to the growth that we've seen so far, I would just expect that we will continue to drive ACV, as that brand becomes one of the biggest craft brands in the marketplace. We will continue to see more retailer uptake and more consumer demand for the product. In terms of quantifying what happened with the ACV, I don't have that at hand.", "Vivien Azer", "Okay, that's great. And then my second question also Ballast related please, I know it's a little bit of a ways out, but as you think about the construction of the Virginia Brewery, can you just give us a sense of how you are thinking about the margin opportunity there?", "Rob Sands", "Yes. Well, again, one of the reasons we really like this brand and we've said this since we first announced the purchase is that this brand has very healthy operating margins as we sit here today. It's a little dilutive to our overall beer business, but we would expect over time as the brand gains a little scale and we get some benefits of East Coast production in the Virginia facility, we would expect that that margins begin to close the gap with our import portfolio margins.", "Vivien Azer", "Terrific. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA.", "Caroline Levy", "Good morning and again congrats on a great quarter. My question is on, I wonder if you could get specific, David on A&M as a percent of sales for beer in the quarter, and if you still see it at sort of 8.5 to 9 for the year?", "David Klein", "Yes. 8.5% to 9% and that's across our entire beer business, although most of the spend at this point, as you know, is focused on the import portfolio. On that point, Caroline, I will say that, we've begun advertising on a brand like Pacifico on a broader scale than we have in the past and as a result, we saw very healthy depletion growth on Pacifico of around 17% in the quarter.", "Caroline Levy", "And in the quarter, what was A&M as a percentage of revenue because you said there are some timing differences, so it sounds like it will spike in the second quarter?", "David Klein", "Yes. So in the quarter, yeah, I don't have that number. We can get back to you with the specific number for the quarter.", "Caroline Levy", "Okay. And it would also be helpful and I don't want to really give this, but D&A didn\u2019t seem to go up that much first quarter over fourth quarter, but you have called it out as a margin pressure for beer going forward, as you bring on now the capacity, so, like, would you be able to tell us what D&A was for the beer business in the quarter?", "David Klein", "Yes. We\u2019re going to file the Q today and that information will be in the 10-Q when it\u2019s filed.", "Caroline Levy", "Okay, thanks. Just finally on the timing of advertising, does this suggest that you have more programs coming up than usual in the second quarter, which could be helpful to sales? ", "Caroline Levy", "Yes. And again I think you have to think about it in the context, I know you are asking the question and I'm not answering actually, but you have to think about it in the context of a percentage, because on an absolute dollar basis, I'm not suggesting that we've spent less in the first quarter. It's just less as a percentage of the business. So, we still executed our normal marketing programs in the first quarter of the year, but yes, we do have that activity ramping up in 2Q and then going into the fall support season.", "Caroline Levy", "Okay. Thanks a lot, David.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust.", "Bill Chappell", "Thanks, good morning. Couple of questions, one, Rob, you had talked about only 50% of your business is tracked by IRI, which -- are you seeing any meaningful changes or growth rates or anything in the non-tracked channels or should we not be looking at IRI as closely?", "Rob Sands", "I think the IRI is fairly reflective of our business, but remember that the IRI was not being reflective of the on-premise, which constitutes about 15% or so of the business and it also is not reflective of what goes on in wine and spirits and control subs, so the biggest chunk there is probably on-premise, which in our business is running up about mid-single digits in the beer business and our beer business at low single-digits in our wine business and from a market perspective, is down in both categories, in all categories. Wine, spirits and beer, on premise was down as a category or as a market segment for the category for the quarter. So that's probably one of the biggest callouts is on premise not being reflective, not being reflected by IRI.", "Bill Chappell", "Yes. That helps. And then second, just to follow up on Ballast Point now, as the distribution has expanded, can you kind of tell us what your learnings for a product that\u2019s at the high-end of the price range that was largely a West Coast regional brand, I mean how has it resonated versus kind of expectations as you moved it more and more to the east and with the price points kind of compared to other things on the shelf?", "Rob Sands", "Well, I think it's resonated really well. I mean, where we have gotten new distribution as we moved it to the east, I think that it's resonating particularly well. I'm not sure that it's perceived with any geographic specificity as we bring it into new markets and as we grow the new markets, I think that it\u2019s really more viewed as a really high-end, high quality, award winning brand and it\u2019s all about sort of style and flavors, and I think the thing that's kind of unique or somewhat unique about Ballast Point is that, it does have a lot of different styles like [indiscernible] or the Sculpin IPA and then it\u2019s got flavors and has like the Grapefruit Sculpin or the new Pineapple Sculpin, which is really hot or a new product, which we just intro-ed called Varmint, which is a honey flavored pale ale, but this is very subtle stuff, right. It's not like it\u2019s flavored like a flavored fab, okay, like [indiscernible] these are very subtle flavors that accentuate, okay, these sort of exotic hops that are used in the product and sort of bring out some of the qualities of those hops and therefore it\u2019s, I\u2019d say real beer and appeals to, I would say, real beer aficionados, which is one of the reasons why I think that it is able to command the premium pricing that it does command is because of the fact that it really is viewed by beer people, okay, as a super-high quality, award winning product, a lot like wine in that regard, right, high-end wine. Think of its acceptance in that vein by real craft beer drinkers who know and follow what's really being held as super high quality examples of that type of product. So it\u2019s much more like that, much more like high end wine is the way I would think about Ballast Point.", "Bill Chappell", "Okay, thanks so much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Nicolaus.", "Mark Swartzberg", "Thanks, good morning, everyone. Two questions, one on Modelo Especial, Rob, if we could perhaps go a little bit deeper there, its growth stronger than Corona Extra, I'm sure that was true again in the quarter, I didn't catch the depletion rate, could you just give us a flavor for not only what the depletion rate for the brand was in the quarter, but what your plans are to perhaps accelerate the rate of depletion growth for that brand specifically. I'm interested in ACV intentions, spend rate, trying to get a better sense of where we are with that success story?", "Rob Sands", "Yes. So Modelo Especial depletion growth rate first quarter about 20% and we've got big plans to, say, accelerate that growth rate or at least maintain it, but -- and as you pointed out, it's all about distribution, I mean Modelo Especial is growing and it\u2019s the size that it is without being in full distribution, okay, compared to other major brands of its size, it\u2019s one of the top beer brands now in the entire country and if you look at beer brands that have full distribution, I mean, you\u2019re talking like 80%, 90%, okay. Modelo Especial has about 70% ACV. So it's got a pretty good distribution runway and I think that the thing that you should realize is in general, okay, it\u2019s distribution growth that drives depletion growth probably the most of anything. So pretty big runway there. It's a good news that probably the second most important thing, right, is velocity per point of distribution and if you look at our portfolio in general, whether it\u2019s wine, beer, spirits, Modelo Especial or fast-growing brands, are achieving their growth through both velocity growth as well as distribution growth.", "Mark Swartzberg", "Got it. And what I\u2019m hoping to better understand is, this summer or the next few quarters, is there the intent to pick up the pace of ACV gains for that brand versus what they\u2019ve been, given what you just said or because the other choice of course is to say, Corona Extra is the horse here?", "Rob Sands", "ACV growth has been and will continue to be a number one priority for the beer business and Modelo Especial in particular, when you say pick up, it's not like we wrapped at a particular point in time on distribution growth, it\u2019s what, that is what the sales organization basically is all about and does, okay. When companies like ourselves talk about execution or sales execution, they\u2019re talking about growing distribution first and foremost and then probably the number to think in sales organization execution is all about merchandising and add activity at retail. So that's what sales forces do. That\u2019s all they do, they run out and get distribution. They grow distribution and they work with the distributors and the retailers to maximize the merchandising opportunities.", "Mark Swartzberg", "Got it. Okay. And my second question, I\u2019ll stay on that brand, media spend for Modelo Especial rate of growth, can you give us a sense, we heard about the portfolio rate of growth picking up here over the next few quarters, is it fair to think that that particular brand is getting an outsized rate of increase versus Corona Extra and some other brands or is that not the right way to think about it?", "David Klein", "We don't really break down the spend between the brands publicly, but I would say that we know that last year, we started to spend more in terms of general market advertising as it relates to Modelo Especial, you\u2019ll continue to see that ramp up for the remainder of this year.", "Rob Sands", "And I\u2019d also point out that, and I think this was mentioned previously, I mean we have put some media advertising in place for Pacifico and Pacifico is absolutely on fire with 17% depletion growth in the first quarter and I would say there is a lot of chatter beginning -- we are beginning to hear a lot of chatter about that particular brand and its general -- and its appeal in particular to craft drinkers. It seems to be a brand that when craft drinkers aren\u2019t drinking, I would say traditional craft, okay, it\u2019s sort of their next go to session item, seems to be Pacifico and we\u2019re seeing a lot of interest an growth in that particular product and that 24-hours can has been on fire. So I would say that is something you should watch as the next up and comer.", "Mark Swartzberg", "That's, great. Okay. Excellent. Thank you, Rob. Thanks, David.", "Operator", "And that was our final question. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks.", "Rob Sands", "Okay. Well, thank you everybody for joining our call today. As we wrap up our discussion, I want to reiterate how pleased we are with the overall excellent performance of our business this quarter. Our fiscal \u201817 is off to a fantastic start and we\u2019re confident in our ability to achieve our full-year guidance. As we head into the 4th of July holiday weekend, I hope you remember to bring some of our fine products to your celebrations and to please enjoy them of course responsibly. Hopefully, you received the save the date notice for our planned New York City Investor Meeting on November 9. At that time, we look forward to speaking with you about the future strategy for our business. Thanks and have a great July 4th holiday.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Following the prepared remarks, the call will be opened for your question. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions].", "I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Patty Yahn-Urlaub", "Thank you, Maria. Good morning everyone and welcome to Constellation's fourth quarter and fiscal yearend 2017 conference call. I am here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Klein, our Chief Financial Officer.", "This call complements our news release, which has also been furnished to the SEC. During this call, we may discuss financial information on a GAAP, comparable, organic and constant currency basis. However, discussions will generally focus on comparable financial results. Reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and these and other non-GAAP measures are included in the news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com.", "Please also be aware that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. While those statements represent our best estimates and expectations, actual results could differ materially from our estimates and expectations. For a detailed list of risk factors that may impact the company's estimates, please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings.", "Before turning the call over to Rob, I would like to ask that we continue our practice of limiting each person to two questions during the Q&A session, which will help to end our call on schedule. Thanks, in advance and now, here is Rob.", "Rob Sands", "Thanks, Patty, and good morning, and welcome to our yearend call. Fiscal 2017 was a very dynamic and rewarding year marked by milestones that produced impressive double-digit growth in sales, EBIT, and operating cash flow.", "Our path for these impressive results was paved by great execution in growing our core business supported by investments to enhance our portfolio and our operations. I believe it's worth reviewing our achievements as they collectively illustrate our commitment to sustaining profitable growth and building shareholder value. I'll follow that up with a review of our business performance along with some of the great initiatives we have underway for fiscal 2018.", "We made a series of value-creating portfolio moves that aligned with our premiumization strategy and enabled us to capitalize on U.S. market trends that favor high-end wine and spirits brands. This included our acquisitions of The Prisoner and Charles Smith wine brands as well as High West Distillery, which paved our entrance into the high-end craft whiskey category.", "Each of these additions boast award-winning products, premium positioning and exceptional, exceptional growth. In fact, these newly acquired brands grew depletions 47%, 67%, and 34% respectively during our fourth quarter. Meanwhile, the recent sale of our Canadian wine business supports our strategy to focus on higher growth, higher margin business initiatives, and to strengthen the financial profile of our overall wine and spirits business.", "Even after the sale of this business, Canada remains our largest export market as we have had excellent success selling some of our focused brands in the Canadian market, including Kim Crawford, Ruffino, and Robert Mondavi.", "Now these activities were complemented by constellation ventures investments to further explore innovation in brown spirits. They include Catoctin Creek Distilling Company, a producer of premium rye whiskey and gin from organic sources. Bardstown Bourbon, the largest new whiskey distillery in the U.S. and Nelson's Greenbrier distillery, a producer of craft whiskeys.", "From an operational perspective, we made strategic investments in our beer business to ensure we have the capacity, quality, control, and flexibility to support the exceptional industry-leading growth of our beer business and to meet expected consumer demand for our products well into the future.", "We recently acquired ABI's brewing operation in Obregon Mexico, which provides an immediate source of supply and functioning brewery capacity for our iconic portfolio of Mexican import brands as well as flexibility for future innovation initiatives. During the fourth quarter, we completed the next phase of expansion at our Nava Brewery in Mexico to reach 25 million hectoliters of capacity ahead of schedule.", "And earlier this year, we fired up furnace number two at our nearby glass plant which is now producing quality glass at optimal capacity levels. Throughout fiscal 2017, particularly later in the year, we repurchased more than $1 billion worth of outstanding shares during periods when our stock traded at prices that we determined to be good value, and we achieved investment grade debt status for the first time in the company's history.", "So, to recap, the record operating cash flow that we generated in fiscal 2017 provided significant capital allocation flexibility that enabled a sizable dividend increase, significant share repurchases, value-creating acquisitions, and investments to support the outstanding growth momentum of our business.", "So, let's move now to a discussion of the excellent business performance our team achieved in fiscal 2017 and some of the initiatives we have underway for the coming year. Our beer business continues to be a powerhouse for growth as the number one brewer and seller of imported beer in the U.S. market.", "For the fourth consecutive year in fiscal 2017, Constellation is the number one, the number one growth contributor in the U.S. beer category, outperforming key competitors and all other imports, and Constellation was the leader and number one share gainer in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market in calendar 2016 with our beer business driving almost 100% of import volume growth.", "Now as we look back at the past year's accomplishments and ahead to fiscal 2018, let's begin our discussion with the clear heavyweights in our portfolio, Corona Extra and Modelo Especial. Our flagship Corona Extra brand has been gaining share and is one of just three brands driving the majority of the growth in the high-end of the U.S. beer market.", "In fiscal 2017, this brand grew depletions about 5% versus the prior year and also achieved status on Interbrand\u2019s Top 100 best global brands list. In fiscal 2018, for the fifth consecutive year, we're planning double-digit increases in our Corona media investments and this has been a key growth driver of the brand with particular focus on live sports, including the NBA, year-round soccer, boxing, and the NFL, which deliver the highest reach against our target consumers.", "Some of the several major initiatives in place to continue driving Corona Extra's growth, we recently introduced three-pack 24 ounce cans in California and are expanding to additional markets, and we plan to regionally expand Corona Extra draft beyond where it is available today.", "Corona Extra cans continue to represent a big growth opportunity. So, upcoming plans this year include increased media investments and a new TV advertisement, highlighting a limited edition can. We also expanded our social media support and partnerships to focus on the can format, the on-premise channel and providing enhanced retail tools.", "Many of these activities are expected to be in full swing as we launch our 120 days of summer campaign beginning with Cinco de Mayo. We recently launched Corona Premier in key test markets, and while it is still too early to call, we are very pleased with the results to date in these markets.", "We are also in test markets with Corona Familiar 12 ounce bottles. Corona Familiar quarts are already one of the largest packages in the Corona franchise, and so far we are pleased with the early results in the market test.", "Moving to Casa Modelo. This trio of brands which includes Modelo Especial, Modelo Negra and Modelo Especial Chelada, is one of the biggest forces in beer, delivering more than 14 million cases of growth to the U.S. beer category in calendar 2016. Modelo Especial which is the Casa Modelo flagship brand has achieved double-digit growth for nearly 25 years and has been one of the largest contributors to US beer category growth over the last five years.", "Ranked number seven nationally in dollars, Modelo Especial is now a top five beer in eight major U.S. markets and the number one, the number one beer in Los Angeles. Last year this brand grew depletions more than 18% to almost 85 million cases. In fiscal 2018, our biggest opportunity for Modelo Especial lies in expanding distribution and enhancing our innovation pipeline and we plan to continue to advertise across the entire Modelo family, including New TV and digital advertising.", "We also see tremendous opportunity in the on-premise channel, where Modelo Especial grew almost 25% across draft, bottle and can offerings last year. The draft format alone increased more than 45% making it the fastest growing U.S. draft beer brand and the number one shared on-premise channel in 2016.", "In fact, in recent syndicated on-premise data, Modelo Especial became the largest volume Mexican draft beer in the entire country. Modelo Especial will have a full lineup of retail programs and consumer promotions delivering execution from Cinco de Mayo to the Christmas holiday in fiscal 2018. Modelo Especial recently became the official and exclusive import beer of the Chicago White Sox.", "This new marketing partnership offers brand exposure across the White Sox as expansive, marketing assets, digital platforms, arena signage and an all new bar connected with the stadium. In Calendar 2016, Modelo Especial Chelada contributed 95% of Chelada category growth in the U.S. beer market. To capitalize on this trend, Chelada Tamarindo Picante was recently launched becoming the second Chelada flavor to join the Casa Modelo portfolio.", "In addition, we are launching Chelada three packs to expand our single-serve distribution as well as Modelo Especial 18 packs to allow loyal customers to trade up to larger packages size and hit future price points at retail focused on basket building with larger pack sizes.", "Now as you're aware, the bench strength of our beer portfolio goes deeper than our biggest brands, we believe Pacifico has the potential to be the next big national brand in our beer business. In Calendar 2016, this brand sold five million cases in the State of California alone, not only is Pacifico growing double-digits in California, we have had excellent success with our recent expansion efforts in markets like Seattle and Denver with the addition of TV advertising.", "Pacifico draft velocities are also strong across the country. As a matter of fact, after eight consecutive years of consistent single-digit growth, Pacifico reached the eight million case mark and achieved depletion growth of almost 20% in fiscal 2017. In fiscal 2018, we are launching the Pacifico 12 ounce can to build on success of the 24-ounce SKU.", "We are doubling our advertising with two new TV spot in channels like ESPN, TNT and Comedy Central, while also investing in live sports including the NBA, MLB and NFL and let's not forget about Ballast Point, which was the number two-dollar growth contributor in the U.S. craft market this past year adding almost 11% of craft industry volume growth and posting double-digit depletion growth.", "Throughout the year, Ballast Point beers were awarded more than 40 medals including gold for Grapefruit Sculpin and California Ambers at the U.S. Open Beer Championship. They also won the 2016 Champion Large International Brewery Award for Brewing Excellence at the Australian International Beer Awards.", "In fiscal 2018, our plan is to continue to expand Ballast Point distribution. We have opportunities to drive continued growth through innovation with brands like Monterey, Monterey Double IPA, Red Velvet Nitro, Bonito Blonde Ale and Sea Rose Tart Cherry Wheat Ale just to name a few.", "As you would expect, I have assembled every one of these unique beers and I believe they are all winners. We are also planning to increase our Ballast Point sales and marketing investments while leveraging Constellation resources like National Accounts. These initiatives are expected to drive the double-digit growth we are targeting in fiscal 2018 for Ballast Point.", "We continue to build our East Coast brewery in Belleville Virginia and expect to be brewing there this fall. Overall I am excited about the growth prospects for our beer business for fiscal 2018 and as you can see, we have tremendous opportunity to grow the business to enhance distribution and execution opportunities across the portfolio.", "As a result, we are targeting beer business net sales growth in the 9% to 11% range and operating income growth of 11% to 13%. Now before moving on wine and spirits, I would like to take a minute to discuss, published IRI and Nielsen Consumer Takeaway Data for our beer business, that corresponds with our fourth quarter results as there seems to be significant discussion related to these growth trends.", "First IRI channels represent about 50% of our overall beer business at retail and therefore provide only a partial picture of the brand and portfolio performance outside of the sales, shipment and depletion results we report each quarter.", "With IRI channels throughout the fourth quarter, we experienced significant variability from week to week, especially in the month of December, which was a challenging month for the entire U.S. beer industry. Much of this relates the year-over-year timing and selling day comparison issues for important holidays during the quarter, including Christmas and New Year.", "We also experienced poor weather versus the prior year in the month of February particularly in California which is our largest market. While consumer takeaway is a standard measurement, depletions represent our entire business and are an even more comprehensive indicator of growth.", "Given some of the factors I just mentioned, we continue to see an increase in brand relevance and key brands health metrics for our entire portfolio and we are on track to deliver the completion growth of 9% to 10% for the first calendar quarter of 2017.", "As I mentioned earlier our Nava brewery completed its next expansion phase ahead of schedule and became complete independent from ABI Interim Supply Agreement with the acquisition of the Obregon brewery. The Nava brewery is also ahead of schedule to deliver on the next phase of expansion, which takes the brewery 27.5 million hectoliters of capacity by calendar year end and we are getting ready to fire up furnace number three in the coming months at our adjacent Nava glass plant.", "The Obregon brewery continues to integrate systems and processes with the Constellation business and is performing at a very high utilization level. We are developing plans to increase our output from this site and are very pleased with the prospects that this brewery brings to our operational footprint and as mentioned last quarter, we have re-scoped our Mexicali project to initially built 5 million hectoliters of production capacity at a more measured pace as a result of the acquisition of the Obregon brewery.", "And now I would like to focus on our operational results for our wine and spirits business, which achieved strong earnings and margin growth for the year. During fiscal 2017, we executed a key strategic -- our key strategies related to premiumization, innovation and brand building.", "Overall our wine and spirits portfolio gained total channel volume share in Calendar 2016 while delivering exceptional results for our fast-growing higher margin focused brands, which grew depletions about 9% for the year. Many of these focused brands achieved significant milestones and accomplishments last year.", "Four of our brands were featured on wine.com's top 100 list for calendar 2016, including The Prisoner, Kim Crawford, which emerges the number one Sauvignon Blanc and IRI channels and Meiomi, which is achieved the one million case milestone. Our products also called out in the Beverage Information Group's Awards where four of our brand achieved fast track status recognizing their impressive growth. Three were named rising stars and seven were listed as established growth brands including Mark West, Ruffino, Simi and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi.", "From an operational perspective, we improved productivity and created efficiencies through our cost of goods sold optimization initiatives and we continue to drive efficiencies throughout our wine and spirits manufacturing operations. For the year, our spirits portfolio posted excellent net sales growth of 9% driven by High West, Paul Masson and SVEDKA.", "And from a strategic perspective, in fiscal 2018, our goal for the wine and spirits business is to grow profits ahead of sales while improving margin, which is reflected in our fiscal 2018 wine and spirits guidance of 46% sales growth and profit growth in the 5% to 7% range for the year.", "So what will be the drivers of this goal? We plan to optimize our route to market by evolving our organizational structure to better align with the way we interact with our distributors and our retailers while further developing our account segmentation capabilities to ensure that we are targeting the right products and the right accounts during the right time of the year.", "Now these changes in our route to market structure provide additional focus on the higher margin, Fine Wine and Spirits part of our business. We remain committed to mix and margin accretive innovation and new product development and have several new products in the pipeline. This requires us to maintain the discipline we have established with our research and development efforts.", "It also includes continuing the renovation work we have begun with brands like Robert Mondavi Private Selection, which is a great turnaround story. Building on the success of this brand, we have also renovation plans for some of our other brands, including Clos du Bois, Estancia and Clos.", "We are excited about the innovation brands we recently launched and are planning to launch this coming year including Ravage, Cooper & Thief, Kelly collection, Clos du Bois Lightly Effervescent Chardonnay and Meiomi just to name a few. We plan to aggressively manage our core business and drive acceleration of key focused brands that have scale, growth, momentum and higher margins.", "This is going to require increased marketing investment to achieve this goal. For example, we are launching a new TV advertising campaign for Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi, which is the largest wine brand in our portfolio and we are significantly increasing our digital investments.", "We also have plans to rationalize our portfolio of hotel brand and have already begun the process of discounting about 15% of our lower margin value brand SKUs in an effort to simplify our portfolio and drive focus on those brands that will drive higher profitability and higher returns and for the fourth consecutive year, we plan to execute price increases for selected products within the portfolio.", "Finally, we are committed to operational effectiveness with an increased focus on safety, service and quality while delivering new capabilities from our technology investments. This also includes an expansion of wine and spirits sourcing initiatives to optimize supply by achieving the right style, quality and margins structure across our brand portfolio and we plan to improve production efficiencies through ongoing footprint consolidation.", "In closing it has certainly been another exciting year at Constellation. We are very proud to have delivered another rewarding year of value to our shareholders and I am pleased that our results can support a significant dividend increase in the coming year.", "We've delivered exceptional performance and continued growth momentum and remain one of the best performing companies among our consumer peers. In fact, Constellation drove more dollars sales growth in the next three beverage alcohol companies combined and we constricted 25% of the overall U.S. total beverage alcohol industry growth in calendar 2016.", "That's why we believe that Constellation provides the best-in-class combination of sustainable topline growth and profitability in the consumer products space. I would like to thank our employees for their outstanding efforts this past year and our shareholders for their continued support.", "With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David Klein will review our financial results for fiscal 2017 and provide the outlook for fiscal 2018. Thank you.", "David Klein", "Thanks Rob. And good morning, everyone.", "Fiscal '17 was another exciting year as we continue to generate top-tier growth in the CPG space. Our businesses turned strong marketplace performance into strong financial performance as we generated over 7.3 billion of net sales and 12% net sales growth, expanded operating margins in both businesses and improved our consolidated comparable basis operating margin by 140 basis points, increased comparable basis EBIT and diluted EPS 18% and 24% respectively and produced $1.7 billion of operating cash flow, an increase of 20%.", "The strong earnings, operating cash flow growth and divestiture of the Canadian wine business helped our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio finish at 3.7 times, even as we made capital investments in our Mexican operations, purchased the Obregon brewery, acquired The Prisoner, Charles Smith and High West and returned cash to shareholders with $315 million of dividends paid and $1.1 billion in repurchases of stock.", "We expect fiscal '18 to be another year of strong financial performance as we're targeting healthy net sales, EBIT, comparable basis EPS and operating cash flow growth, while we continue to invest in our world-class Mexican beer operating platform and increase our dividend per share by approximately 30%.", "Let's look at fiscal '17 performance in more detail where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results starting with beer. Net sales grew 17%. Organic net sales increased 13% primarily due to volume growth of 11% and favorable pricing. Depletion growth for the year came in at 10.4%.", "These results were in-line with the enhanced beer guidance we provided at the second quarter. I would like to point out that previously reported beer shipment and depletions volume have been restated for a correction related to the conversion of 7-ounce Coronita cases to 12-ounce 24-pack case equivalents. This restatement had an immaterial impact on previously reported growth rates.", "We've added historical shipment and depletion information to our segment schedule located in the financial history section of our investor website. Beer operating margin increased 140 basis points to 36.3%. Benefits from pricing and foreign currency were partially offset by marketing investments and consolidation of the Ballast Point business.", "For wine and spirits, net sales increased 6%. This reflects a 4% increase in organic net sales driven by volume growth and favorable mix and an acquisition benefit from Meiomi and The Prisoner. Total U.S. depletions grew 3% for the year while our focus brand portfolio posted 9% depletion growth.", "Wine and spirits' operating margin increased 100 basis points to 25.8%. Benefits primarily from the addition of Meiomi and The Prisoner along with favorable mix were partially offset by investments in SG&A and marketing. Interest expense for the year increased 6% to $333 million as higher average borrowing rates were partially offset by lower average interest rates.", "When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt at the end of February totaled $9.1 billion an increase of $1.1 billion since the end of fiscal '16. This activity primarily reflects the funding for The Prisoner, Charles Smith, High West and Obregon acquisitions as well as our stock repurchases, partially offset by proceeds from the divestiture of the Canadian wine business and our free cash flow generation.", "Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio came in at 3.7 times at the end of fiscal '17 versus 3.8 times at the end of fiscal '16. Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the year came in at 26.8% versus 29.6% last year. This reflects a benefit of the APB 23 Accounting on part of our current year foreign earnings.", "As a reminder, during Q3 fiscal '17, we determined that a portion of our foreign earnings would be indefinitely reinvested. This assertion allows the company to record income taxes on certain foreign earnings using the applicable foreign jurisdiction tax rates rather than the higher U.S. tax rate.", "Now let's review Q4 results. Comparable basis diluted EPS came in at a $1.48 per share up 24%. Organic beer net sales increased 10% due to volume growth of 9% and favorable pricing. Beer operating margin increased 320 basis points to 38%. This increase was primarily driven by foreign currency as the benefits from pricing was essentially offset by higher depreciation.", "Wine and spirits' organic net sales increased 4% mostly due to volume growth. Wine and spirits' operating margin increased to 160 basis points to 26.6%. Benefits from the divestiture of the Canadian wine business and the acquisition of The Prisoner and Charles Smith were partially offset by investments in SG&A and marketing.", "Moving to Fiscal '17 free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, we generated $789 million compared to $522 million last year. Operating cash flow totaled $1.7 billion up 20% primarily driven by our earnings growth and CapEx totaled $907 million, which was slightly above last year spent.", "Moving to our full year fiscal '18 P&L and free cash flow outlook, for fiscal '18 we expect to leverage our ongoing portfolio premiumization efforts and execute the marketplace initiatives, outlined by Rob, to deliver another year of strong financial performance as we are projecting our comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $7.70 to $8 per share.", "The midpoint of this guidance has us targeting 16% growth. Our beer business is targeting net sales growth in the range of 9% to 11% and operating income growth in the range of 11% to 13%. Our projections include 1% to 2% of anticipated pricing benefit from our Mexican portfolio.", "We're pleased that our beer operating margin finished fiscal '17 a little over 36%, which was a little above the high-end of our most recent guidance. The outperformance was primarily driven by FX favorability that I discussed earlier.", "Our fiscal '18 beer segment guidance had us targeting operating margin expansion for the year. In fiscal '18, we expect to see positive growth margin benefits from product pricing, ongoing favorability from foreign currency, glass sourcing initiatives and supply independence from ABI. These benefits will be partially offset by our ramp up in depreciation as we continue to bring assets online and optimize new capacity.", "Looking closer at depreciation and amortization expense for the beer segment, it totaled $115 million in fiscal '17. We expect that to increase by approximately 50% in fiscal '18. We also fiscal '18 SG&A and marketing spend rate as a percentage of sales to be similar to fiscal '17.", "For the wine and spirits business for fiscal '18, we expect reported net sales to decrease in the range of 46% and operating income to be flat. These projections include the estimated negative impact of the divestiture of the Canadian wine business and the estimated incremental benefits from the High West, Charles Smith and The Prisoner acquisitions.", "As outlined in our press release, for fiscal '17 through the mid-December divestiture date, net sales and operating income that will no longer be part of our wine and spirits segment as a result of the sale of the Canadian wine business, totaled $311 million and $50 million respectively.", "When excluding these amounts from our fiscal '17 wine and spirits results, we expect net sales growth of 46% and operating income growth 5% to 7% as our premiumization activities continue to drive operating margin expansion.", "In addition, we expect our tax rate to approximate 22%. The decrease versus the fiscal '17 tax rate reflects additional anticipated foreign tax rate benefits through the APB 23 assertion on a larger portion of our foreign earnings and an anticipated benefit from a new accounting standard related to stock-based payment awards, which Constellation will adopt starting in fiscal '18. Let me spend a few minutes on this.", "In fiscal '17 in prior years, accounting standards required excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards to be recognized in equity and the cash benefit to be reflected in the financing section of the cash flow statement.", "The new standard now requires this benefit to be recognized as a reduction of tax expense in the income statement and presented in the operating section of the cash flow statement. Our tax rate guidance includes an estimated 3% benefit related to the adoption of this new standard.", "This benefit can fluctuate significantly depending on the timing and level of stock option exercises. As a result of this, we expect much more volatility in our effective tax rate on an annual and a quarterly basis. Interest expense is expected to be in the range of $340 million to $350 million and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are targeted at $201 million. This does not assume additional share repurchases.", "I would also note that our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. We expect fiscal '18 free cash flow to be in the range of $725 million to $825 million. This reflects operating cash flow in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion and CapEx in the range of $1.175 billion to $1.275 billion.", "This includes approximately $1 billion of CapEx for our Mexico beer operations expansion. Fiscal '18 should represent the peak spending year for these activities. In closing, we believe we have the right strategies in place to capture the growth opportunities in beverage alcohol over the long-term. Our impressive fiscal '17 results and our business initiatives and financial goals for fiscal '18, demonstrate our focus on generating sustainable growth and top-tier financial performance in the CPG space as part of our efforts to increase shareholder value.", "And with that, Rob and I are happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.", "Dara Mohsenian", "Hey good morning, guys.", "Rob Sands", "Hey Dara.", "Dara Mohsenian", "So, Rob on the beer volume front, you continue to perform very well from a growth standpoint and obviously from a market share standpoint within the industry. It's not much of a change versus the larger brewers, but we have seen more recently a large slowdown in the craft segment and getting more fair share of merchandising and distribution has already been a focus for you guys in terms of your beer portfolio.", "So in light of those factors, I was just hoping you could review for us, the rated distribution expansion you're expecting in fiscal 2018? Should we expect an acceleration versus recent trend, and then secondly, also on the beer volume front now that you have more capacity in place, are there any big opportunities across your brand portfolio or on the innovation front that you're now pursuing more aggressively as a result of the capacity growth, thanks?", "Rob Sands", "So yeah, we are expecting to increase the pace of distribution growth across our beer portfolio. In fact, we expect roughly 70% of our growth in beer next year Dara to come from distribution growth. So, this is really the key variable in achieving our results and with the momentum behind our portfolio and the nature of our portfolio entirely on the high end and really being one of the most important profit drivers at wholesale and at retail, okay, we expect that we will achieve our distribution growth goals and therefore our overall growth goals.", "Now to your next question about production capacity and innovation, the answer to your question is 100% totally. We are well set up now to really drive, number one, parts of the business that we haven't been driving really because we were concerned while we were under the interim supply agreement and we didn't have necessarily the capacity in place to start driving business that we were uncertain that we could supply.", "So certainly in terms of existing brands, other brands in the portfolio like Pacifico where we're really starting to make a push to driving that to be one of the key growth providers in the portfolio is an example and then clearly our NPD in beer, which we\u2019ve recently launched right, Corona Premier and the Corona Familiar product are examples of NPD that we weren\u2019t in a position to do up until now, but now we are extremely well positioned with two big breweries Nava and Obregon fully on stream as well as a third brewery well underway.", "So, we're very optimistic about what both we can do now with yet another brand that we think is going to be a big growth driver of Pacifico and what we can do with NPD, and the business which appears to be very successful at least in test markets thus far.", "Dara Mohsenian", "Okay. That's helpful and then David on the beer margin side, the expansion of 60 basis points implied by the midpoint of the initial fiscal '18 guidance, it still seems conservative despite the depreciation increase when you consider the historical expansion and all the positive factors you mentioned like the glass savings pricing, topline leverage moving off ISI etcetera.", "So, it seems like those positive factors would overwhelm significantly the depreciation increase. So are there other prohibitive factors limiting the margin upside as you look to next year beyond the depreciation or are you just being conservative this early in the year.", "David Klein", "I think of our $2 billion of COGS and beer, there are just a lot of moving parts, things that swing your way things that move in the other direction. I want to just make clear that our guidance implies a peso rate of about 20 pesos to the dollar right, and we know that's running a little bit less than that. It's in the high 18s as we sit here today.", "So, you I think it's -- I think we're suggesting continued margin expansion, but I think we're just being prudent at this point in the year.", "Dara Mohsenian", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.", "Judy Hong", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Rob Sands", "Hi Judy.", "Judy Hong", "Hi. So, I guess just going back to the beer volume, certainly the Nielsen IRI could be very pretty volatile, but it looks like your depletion growth has also been pretty volatile in the last few months. Cagney had talked about 8% depletion for the fourth quarter. You came in at 6.2%, which implies obviously a pretty big slowdown in February and then March looks like it's got better.", "So just a little bit of color just in terms of what's going on, obviously, the broader industry has been pretty soft, but certainly the weather is having an impact, but any color just in terms of the cadence of your depletion growth and then what you've seen so far from a March perspective would be great.", "Rob Sands", "So yes, Judy, as it relates to our fourth quarter performance, I would say that February ended up a little softer than we had expected at the time, and I think there's a danger in watching the week-to-week or even month-to-month depletions. I think if you look at our overall trends in the business, we continue to gain share in the business at about the same rate as we have been over the last 12 to 24 months.", "Clearly total beverage alcohol has slowed down a little bit over the past 12 months, but that seems to be mirroring what's happening in the broader CPG category as well. So, we feel pretty confident to be sitting here in early April and putting out I think some pretty strong guidance for our fiscal '18.", "So, despite the volatility that we're seeing, we're pretty confident in our ability to deliver these numbers.", "David Klein", "And I guess I'll just add Judy that what's becoming I think obviously to everyone is that in the short term, sort of as a result of where holidays fall, the number of sell days in a particular month etcetera, there's a lot of fluctuation in the short-term that can affect short-term volume, whether you're talking depletions or otherwise.", "And I would encourage everybody to sort of focus on stacked results as opposed to focusing on these very short-term numbers, which there is a lot of volatility associated with those short-term numbers and you can see it in December numbers, which were across the industry not very good okay and is driving a lot of the slowdown.", "And in December basically what you had were holidays falling on weekend and instead of the middle of the week. So instead of people drinking twice during the week, they were only drinking once during the week on the weekend. Okay, this really affect things.", "In March okay and April, you're going to see a shift which by the way I think this will affect wine and spirits more than it will beer, you're going to see a shift of Easter into April this year, right, mid-April this year from March last year.", "So that's really going to affect the numbers that you're going to be looking at on a short-term basis and this is especially in wine and spirits because there tends to be more of a wine and spirits drinking holiday than a beer drinking holiday, but I think you have to look at those stack results now.", "In our case right, fourth quarter yet depletions in beer looked a little lackluster and then you look at first quarter of the calendar year and I would say everything basically bounced right back to be very consistent with the growth that we're expecting throughout the remainder of the year and we see nothing at all right now that would suggest to us that just on a general proposition whether it's across -- whether it's beer or wine or spirits, maybe talk about the industry as a whole, I think that we're fairly confident that you'll see things reverse to the mean as it relates to industry growth across TBA and I think on our own growth, we see nothing inhibiting us from achieving our guidance across the wine, beer and spirits portfolio, which I think will be very strong continued results.", "Judy Hong", "Okay. Got it. And then secondly, just on beer pricing outlook, so I think you're sticking to the 1% to 2% pricing for 2018. There is obviously been some pricing permission in the high end within Ultra. How do you think about your ability to get to that 1% to 2% pricing? Have you taken some of that pricing already in some of your markets and sort of your comfort level on that front?", "Rob Sands", "Sort of a same story. We see no innovation or issues in achieving our pricing guidance. You point out every quarter and basically every year we're talking about some skirmish that has occurred especially in beer the constitutes some tea leaf reading, right.", "So whether it's low prices on Mic Ultra, somewhere for some reason or whether last year it was the giving away of goose CAGS in the Northwest, there is countless -- there is countless examples of this stuff all the time, but fundamentally speaking we don't see pricing in the beer market portending anything other than that guidance that we had given and what we expect which is 1% to 2% pricing, which really will take very strategically market by market, brand by brand and again we're confident that we'll achieve that goal.", "David Klein", "And Judy you know that pricing in beer for the most part is taken in the fourth calendar quarter of the year right. So, the pricing that -- the preponderance of the pricing that we're counting on to achieve our guidance is already in the market. ", "Judy Hong", "Yes. Got it. Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Nik Modi from RBC Capital.", "Nik Modi", "Yes. Good morning, everyone. A couple collections, just first David on the guidance on the peso, is that inclusive of hedges, just wanted to clear that up? And then the broader question is so certainly CPD volumes across all industries have slowed lately and I'm just curious you guys are in kind of a unique position because you're gaining so much market share, but I am just curious on your overall take on what you see with the consumer.", "I understand the timing of calendar and holidays and things like that, but it looks like something else is going on, I would be curious to your thoughts.", "David Klein", "So, Nik, I'll take the peso question and then Rob can respond on the market, so we're just saying that we're targeting in our guidance around the 20 pesos to the dollar. That includes our hedge program that's already in place and I would say that we're probably about 50% hedged on the peso.", "Nik Modi", "Got it.", "Rob Sands", "So, Nik, on the consumer side, I think that we definitely saw some softening in consumer confidence in the fourth quarter and efforts of that are highly speculative, but I would say it's certainly around a lot of the political uncertainty and what has transpired across a lot of areas in that regard.", "On the other hand, as we move now past the first quarter right, we're seeing some signs of increased consumer confidence, the jobs number, which came out very recently was higher than expected and by the way, we track things like the correlation of various statistics like job growth, like GDP against our beer performance over long periods and I think a good example of that job growth tends to be a positive for our business and is GDP by the way tend to be a positive for our business.", "So, as we see some of these things improve, I think that you're going to see consumer confidence improve, but you only have to sit around and watch the news to understand that there will continue to be a lot of political uncertainty for the next I guess nobody can, the next is uncertain. The next period of time.", "Or I think you can say that we are totally uncertain about how long there will be political uncertainty.", "Nik Modi", "Fair enough. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.", "Vivien Azer", "Hi. Good morning.", "Rob Sands", "Hey Vivien.", "David Klein", "Hi Vivien.", "Vivien Azer", "So, Rob, I really appreciate your commentary on a bunch of the transitory factors that are impacting both your results and Nielson as well as the more constructive commentary on some of the March data.", "As we kind of look back on fiscal 4Q, is there any way to quantify any of that just opposing California where the weather was really bad relative to your national trends. Anything to help us understand the magnitude of some of that option.", "Rob Sands", "It's all about December right. December was a weird month. If December had been normal, the results would have been normal. That's basically the quantification of everything. So yeah, I told you and I'm sure you're already aware about the holidays and how they fell in December versus the previous year.", "You brought up the weather, I didn't. I don't like to talk about the weather because the one thing that we know for sure is that there's always going to be weather okay and we're in the very fortunate position of not having necessarily to reverse to the weather okay as our excuse for everything.", "So really, I think it falls back to December and you could basically normalize December and you would've ended up with normalized results. As things have thus proved themselves to be the case, following December and looking at the first calendar quarters.", "And then the December thing was across wine beer and spirits. So, I think as it related to our portfolio in particular we've given our guidance and we're confident on our guidance for the year of 2018. So, I think that that's really where the proof is right. It's in the guidance and looking at the first calendar quarter on beer.", "And the IRI to some degree as well which has only constituted 50% of the business, but it remains a fairly decent indicator and IRI looks good.", "Vivien Azer", "Understood. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic of SIG.", "Rob Sands", "Hi Pablo.", "Pablo Zuanic", "Hi. Look just two big question, one, can I just only drill a little bit deeper on the state of the consumer, particularly your Hispanic consumer, you say that that represents about 40% of U.S. sales. Just give us any color you have there. ", "Obviously, you have better pulse of the consumer and most bigger companies giving your exposure there, that would be helpful. I understand you're touching the political situation, but just expand on that.", "And the second question in terms of your relationship, if I just briefly on the relationship with the wholesalers, obviously, distributers they are the gold network, must be very happy with your performance right, you're driving the industry growth, you made good profit margin. But here you are bringing more SKUs to them. ", "You said 70% of your growth is going to come from distribution. You're also bringing balance to them. Is that straining in any way the relationship with the distributors especially when you're counting on distribution being such a big distribution expansion being such a big driver of your growth. Thank you.", "Rob Sands", "Yes. So, I'll take both questions. I think that as it relates to consumer confidence, as you said drilling down on that, if you look in the fourth quarter in particular I do think that we saw a disproportionate negative impact on Hispanic consumer confidence and that's for all of the obvious reasons I think, which is related to all the very unfortunate rhetoric with regard to Mexico coming out of the Trump administration and the news.", "Now that said, I would say that the Trump factor has diminished somewhat and therefore consumer confidence among Hispanics has probably increased a bit with all of the latest rhetoric, which is I wasn\u2019t able to get ACA repeal and replace through that's brought a lot of uncertainty around what they are or are not going to be able to do relative to tax reform.", "I'm sure you saw the comments from the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kelly over the last two or three days basically saying that there isn\u2019t going to be a wall built that will stretch from border to border. Maybe they\u2019ll put up a couple of fences and this and that, but they\u2019ve completely backed off or at least Trump's cabinet has backed off of the long rhetoric which I don't think that the wall is one of the big factors that we're particularly concerned about but it is a concern to our Hispanic consumers and does relate to the consumer confidence.", "So, I think on the Hispanic front, especially Mexican Hispanic, I think the fourth quarter things were a bit disproportionately poor, but I think that it's improving because as things continue to move forward it becomes more obvious to everybody that a lot of this stuff is rhetoric and sort of business as usual in Washington as it relates to elections and election promises versus whatever -- what actually happened.", "So many do have the actual hard statistics like jobs being better than anticipated in the recent jobs report. So that my commentary on that. And then your second question was on yes, relationship with wholesalers, now relationship with wholesalers is not being strained in any way, shape or form. Our relationship with our wholesalers on the beer side couldn\u2019t be better.", "In fact, we are 100% of their growth okay, but Constellation okay, their businesses would be going backwards and their profits would be going backwards. Where their growth driver and in many instances today, we are their largest profit contributor period.", "As you know, we're largely or at least the majority of our distributors are Miller Coors houses and many of the major ones we moved ahead of Miller Coors in terms of profit contribution and as I said, we're providing the growth. They're very excited about new high-end products from us and in fact dying for it is the truth of the matter.", "And then you take a look at a product like Ballast Point, our distributors have not given up in any way, shape or form on the craft strategy, on the craft category. I would say that they are beginning and I think this is a good thing not a bad thing, just like the retailer to take a more measured approach to it and realizing that it doesn't make sense for them to carry every SKU under the sun and that they have to pair down in that regard.", "But clearly as business people both at retail and at wholesale, what they're thinking is we're going to pare down to the brands that are supported from an execution, from merchandising, from an advertising perspective by companies that have the wherewithal to invest behind these brands and they're basically going to get rid of all this no-name stuff that they know that is fly-by-night and the company is behind them don't have the wherewithal to support the brand.", "So, I think that shake out is going to work greatly to our favor and then I think with -- they see that we're bringing resources to this that the other competitive brands can't necessarily bring to the party. Some can. Some can't.", "And when I say resources, it's resources like our national accounts connections, team, hey just -- it's our wholesalers, right, it's a virtuous circle. We bring to them the products that are driving all of their growth, they turn around and focus on the products that are driving all of their growth, which causes those products do better than the other products.", "So, I think that Ballast Point bodes well with and then the positioning of Ballast Point right, the premiumization of it right, this is just, this is exactly what the beer guys are looking for are true premium, high margin beer products and that's both our wholesalers and our retailers. So, I believe they think that it's an exciting proposition and they will continue to drive that business.", "Pablo Zuanic", "All right. Thanks. That's very helpful.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Nicolaus.", "Mark Swartzberg", "Thanks for taking the question. Good morning, everyone. I guess two questions, one for you David and a broader question for you Rob, but there was an impairment charge David of $37.6 million in the quarter. So, what was that for?", "And then Rob if you think about your wine and spirits business, which is performing well and better than it did historically, you have a little bit bigger business in spirit. I'm wondering if that's aiding distribution for your wine brands and if you can give us an update on your appetite for additional spirits bolt-on and then on the wine component of your business, how would you characterize the promotional environment generally and your ability to deal with promotion against your brands from competitors and why", "David Klein", "So, Mark on the impairments, that's really just a continuation of our premiumization strategy. So, we had some wines in particular mostly sub $5 labels. We didn't sell a lot of cases of brands like Tallas or Marcus James that we elected to discontinue in order to shrink the number of brands in our portfolio and drive the premiumization trend. So that was just good housekeeping I would say, from a skew management perspective.", "Mark Swartzberg", "Fair enough. Great.", "Rob Sands", "So, Mark, to your questions, one spirits distribution and how that relates to wine, I would say it's separate largely and they were not. There is no strategy here to use spirits distribution to somehow drive wine distribution.", "In fact, we created a separate spirit salesforce to give more focus to our spirits business because yes, we think that that's a great both growth and margin driver in the future for us, but our early trends use spirits drive wine distribution or necessarily vice versa, except to the extent that we do have a TBA approach and when we are dealing with our major retail customers particularly the chains and mass merchandisers and clubs right where business is gravitating and we're talking to the people who alcoholic beverage roles up to, which there is usually an alcoholic beverage person, we're certainly taking advantage of the fact that across TBA, total beverage alcohol, we're providing all their growth or a large percentage of their growth and we're providing more profit to them largely than anybody else in the industry.", "So this is how we take advantage of our position across beer, wine and spirits with our major customers in that TBA continues to be the most important category in all of retail and especially with the big chains clubs and mass merchandise where that business is also gravitating to is the best profit provider, if you look at their top categories, which are CSR, carbonated software and CRDs and tobacco and alcoholic beverages right, well alcoholic beverages is really their stand out in terms of growth and profitability and dairy right is another category.", "These are all largely declining, highly commoditized categories versus beverage alcohol. So, we do use our TBA position to drive distribution, but as it relates to wine and spirits not really, but the big opportunity does exists for us with spirits and our spirits portfolio we intend to drive that.", "And yeah if we see any tuck-in acquisitions for spirit that we make sense, within our disciplines right, we haven\u2019t put aside any element of our financial discipline on anything that we do nor are we going to.", "Okay. So, we will be selective if tuck-in opportunities. We're not going to -- our financial discipline on some theoretical basis tied around strategy and that isn\u2019t quantifiable into our financial discipline. So, you can fundamentally count on that.", "And then you talked about promo, which\u2026", "Mark Swartzberg", "Can I just interject real quick on the promo just to put that aside for a quick moment, with the cash flow profile of the business being what it is and the dividend increase and the repo you completed over the last fiscal year, I would think that if I'm in your shoes, the ability to pick up the pace of bolt-ons whether they're in spirits or wine or segments of beer is picking up right.", "So that what's driving my question still focused on spirits, but am I right to think that your attitude to pick up the pace is picking up because of the nature of the cash flow situation?", "Rob Sands", "That's an interesting question and my answer is that in terms of our capital deployment strategy okay, it probably hasn't changed or I should say and have chanced okay, as we continue to see our cash flow generation build, we are going to strike the same kind of balance that we have struck between paying down debt and keeping debt levels within our target of the mid three's okay.", "We will also continue to focus on returning value and dollars to shareholders, whether it's through things like our dividend increases or more stock repurchases okay to offset the normal dilution that occurs in our business annually and tuck-in acquisition.", "So, I don't see much changing with regard to any of those three things and we will continue to balance it and then on the tuck-in acquisitions specifically to your question about spirits, that's more a function of deal flow right, like what good things are there out there that will become available that meet our financial discipline like that's a very unclear -- there is no clear answer to that question.", "So, if the deal, if all of a sudden lot of things became available, again balancing those three things, the debt flow, our ability to offset dilution and return money to the shareholders proving back stock, we will look at all of the good deals that are strategic for us, both financially and otherwise in the portfolio as they come along.", "And I say strategic for us, what do I mean by that? Well that's our financial discipline as number one and then number two right, it's got to be high margin, high growth okay. We're not interested in much anything else, but that is in high margin, high growth okay where we wouldn't just do a financial deal on something that was something that did fit into the portfolio and what we're trying to do with the overall business and portfolio.", "So, it's got to be in a category to be high margin and high growth. There is large categories in beverage alcohol. There is insignificant to favor at the current time and we're probably not going to go there nor are we necessarily going to chase the absolute latest and greatest at any moment in time on the other side of that. So, it's all a big balance.", "Mark Swartzberg", "Very, very helpful and on wine, I was just -- the short version, the promotional environment, how would you characterize it as what you're seeing vis-\u00e0-vis your portfolio or what you're looking at into the coming fiscal year?", "Rob Sands", "Well when you think about promotion because there is so much promotional activity in wine, I think that we tend to think more about it in terms of net price realization whether it's through promo or frontline pricing.", "I would say that in terms of net price realization, wine is some robust than it has been in the past meaning in very simple terms whether it's through reduced promotion or for better frontline pricing, there's a little bit more pricing power and pricing, positive pricing activity, increased pricing in wine than there has been in the past.", "And I think that even in our portfolio, we're probably this year planning on taking more pricing than we have even in previous years. So, I would say that's getting to be a fairly robust environment. Everybody is sort of realizing that often the difference between a great business, a good business and a bad business is around how much pricing power there is in the marketplace.", "And wine continued to preimmunize at a very fast rate and with the premiumization and focus becoming now more around wines priced between $15 and $25 as opposed to be between $5 and $10 right, the price sensitivity on all this stuff is somewhat diminishing right because if you're looking at a bottle of Meiomi or other products that are now getting to be in the sweet spot of the commercial part of the business all of a sudden $0.49 is critical as if you were talking about a $5.99 $7.50 or $0.99 is a gigantic percentage. So, I think a positive news.", "Mark Swartzberg", "Great. Thank you, Rob.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.", "Andrea Teixeira", "Hi. Thank you. And congrats on the results. So, I would like to go back to beer, it sounds impossible, your beer gross margins expanded nicely to all-time highs of 52% and you also you also had an EBIT margin that grew nicely.", "So, you're probably driven by this new capacity and the end of the supply agreement, but would you expect us to see more reinvestment in SG&A as you alluded to in the prepared remarks across beer and wine as well and your guidance for the whole company actually implies some of the investment, but I also like margin, gross margin expansion and it's likely EBIT expansion.", "So how should we think of the balance of gross margin, operating margins going forward, especially as you have tougher competitors into the year and related to this if you can expand on the beer utilization I know you probably also have some higher fixed cost. So, do you expect any volatility as we see going through the quarters? Thank you.", "Rob Sands", "Yes. So just thinking about margins kind of at the EBIT margin level Andrea, we do believe that will have some benefits during the years, as I said earlier from FX and some benefits of -- some benefits of coming off of the ISA and in glass sourcing and so forth, offset by depreciation and one-time line commissioning cost because there is still going to be some noise in our COGS as we bring more capacity online.", "I think so you're going to see a little expansion there. I would say that from an SG&A and marketing perspective, you can assume that that's a percentage of sales, that will remain consistent year-over-year. I will say however considering a lot of other consumer products companies talking about the work that they're doing to take cost out of their business, we're doing all of that same work with a view of being able to redeploy resources to initiatives that are going to continue to drive the topline growth of our business.", "So, we are getting some benefits on the SG&A and marketing line, but the benefit is really more effectiveness and more, more topline growth as a result of that work. And then from a capacity utilization standpoint, I would say that we're going to be flat out at Obregon and Nava, as we go through the summer selling season.", "So, I don't expect that we'll see fluctuations in our cost as a result of utilization issues on overhead and in fact our ops guys are really good, but I don't think we'll see I don't think we'll see a lot of spare utilization that they have to try to manage for a couple years yet.", "Andrea Teixeira", "Okay. Thank you. And then for any spirits if I can just add my second question on how -- what are you seeing there because we didn't have a chance to discuss and so organically we're seeing the continuous trends on that category?", "Rob Sands", "Yes. So, we're continuing to see strong growth in the categories that we're playing in spirits right. So, our brand spirit Tequila continue to do well. Our brand in particular continue to do well and the recent IRI High West is up 79%. So, we're seeing good trends in the spirits business as I said in particular in the place where our newest brands like Casa Noble and High West play.", "Andrea Teixeira", "All right. Thanks David. Thanks Rob.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein from Evercore.", "Rob Ottenstein", "Great. Thank you very much. A couple questions, so in the fourth quarter there was a little bit less than a 300-basis point difference between the depletions and the shipments, what does that mean for the first quarter and maybe you talk a little bit about where inventory levels are and what we should expect between shipments and depletions in Q1?", "Rob Sands", "Yes. So, we don't necessarily manage quarter ends all that tightly in beer because the inventory turns pretty quickly. We keep around 30 days of inventory on hand at our distributor on average across the portfolio and we're roughly in line with that at yearend maybe we're up a little bit, but that's to be expected going into this summer selling season.", "So, we're right where we want to be and we don't -- we're not purposely building inventory at distributors, again we like that 30-day mark.", "Rob Ottenstein", "Terrific and then could you talk a little bit about Obregon in terms of its impact in the quarter and in the following year in terms on the income statement and your margins? Is it having a positive impact, negative impact, how should we think about it?", "Rob Sands", "I would say that Obregon's probably it's thin line, it's not accretive or dilutive to our margins. We get some benefit of being off the ISA. We get some mile freight benefits, but to the West Coast shipments, but it's a more costly facility in general to produce in for a whole bunch of reasons, which we're going to try to address over time. So, I would say in the near term it's about a wash.", "Rob Ottenstein", "But it sounds like you have a pathway to actually make it accretive over time.", "Rob Sands", "I think what you'll see over time is you'll see us, yeah, yeah, right and then what we're really looking forward to the date when we actually have three facilities functioning and we can optimize our production runs through those facilities to really try to drive the best possible margins.", "But at this point we're producing and selling all the beer that we can get out -- we're selling all the beer that we can get out of our production facilities.", "Rob Ottenstein", "Terrific. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Credit Suisse", "Laurent Grandet", "Yes. Good morning, everyone and congrats on the strong quarter. The first one is very quick, its confirmation on tax. You guided 22% tax rate for the fiscal '18, is that the new run rate. I understand there will be more volatility here or is it just for full year '18. That's for your David.", "David Klein", "Good question, Laurent because we talked about mid-20s at our Investor Meeting and I would say that the 22% is a bit of a refinement. So, we would expect that we go forward in that 22 to 25. So, it's kind of the low-end of mid-20s.", "But keeping in mind the point that you made, there will be more volatility because of stock-based comp.", "Laurent Grandet", "Okay. Thank you. And my second question really is more for your Rob, you mentioned 70% of the gross would be coming from distribution in the beer segment. Can I have a bit more granularity on this, what would be coming from Corona Can and Modelo versus what would be coming from brands like Pacifico or Ballast and then what's the balance of this 30% shelf space, you're gaining from this year or is it something else, thank you.", "Rob Sands", "Sure. So probably the biggest opportunity for growth is in Modelo Especial where there is a lot of room for distribution growth to get a brand like that up to say the same distribution levels as Corona Extra. So, the focus will be on building Modelo Especial distribution.", "And then Corona cans is another huge opportunity for distribution growth as well as, as I said some of the other products like Pacifico and then Ballast Point is hardly -- hardly has distribution outside of California. So, there's a big opportunity to drive the growth in Ballast Point through targeted distribution in other states.", "So, bottom line is sort of across the portfolio with probably the exception of Corona Glass 12 packs, there's a lot of -- there's just a lot of distribution growth opportunity and distribution growth is the primary way to drive volume growth.", "Laurent Grandet", "And then about the balance of the 30%, is it shelf space you're gaining from light on economy or is it something else?", "Rob Sands", "That would be velocity. It increases in velocity on brands that are getting distribution and becoming more popular. So, you'll see both happen.", "David Klein", "Yes, and a lot of that when we do our regression analysis around a lot of that comes from incremental, or more effective media spend as well as some of -- some demographic and economic tailwinds.", "Laurent Grandet", "Okay. Well, thank you very much Rob and David, thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust.", "Bill Chappell", "Thanks. I guess officially, good afternoon. Just two quick questions. One, you said on Corona that we just finished the fifth year of double-digit increases on advertising and marketing. Will we have a six-year or are we starting to get to the equilibrium or have it where you want to be in terms of behind that brand?", "David Klein", "We continue to get outstanding returns on investment from marketing spend on Corona and so we'll continue to drive that brand and in the context of our total SG&A remaining constant as a percent of net sales, I just want to be clear that we're going to continue to look for ways to be more efficient with our spend across that whole SG&A spectrum so that we have money to invest in brand growth.", "Bill Chappell", "Okay. So, it implies double-digit for the portfolio while G&A gets maybe more efficient.", "David Klein", "Right in aggregate and if you look at our beer business and our beer business guidance has this double digits, it implies everything else stays the same, we'll be getting that kind of growth in our marketing spend.", "Bill Chappell", "Okay. And then one other, I might have missed this but the outlook on great cost this year and what impact it's having on margins?", "David Klein", "I think that that we expect great cost to continue to be very stable and we're not anticipating any material impact on margin. That said, you just don't know right now because until you get to the point where terms can be measured and even that's fairly unreliable because there is a lot of weather that can occur between even then and harvest you don't know what the size of the harvest is going to be, which is what tends of affect great pricing.", "But we're not expecting anything unusual. I would doubt very seriously that we're going to see anything out of the ordinary on great pricing and therefore its impact on margins this year. So, I would say it's something to particularly focus on.", "Bill Chappell", "Got it. That's helpful. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research Group.", "Tim Ramey", "Thanks so much. Rob, I know you don't like to talk about weather but there are three influences here coming up for some of the forecast for Cinco de Mayo as 81 and Sacramento, so that looks good, but it's been really rainy for about break probably difficult to get machines into the field and that's a negative and then groundwater and reservoir levels are good and so that's a positive.", "Is there any takeaway there? You just had touched on that a second ago, but thoughts.", "Rob Sands", "Tim, you're not really supposed to use specialized wine knowledge on these conference calls.", "Tim Ramey", "Yes sir.", "Rob Sands", "But the answer really continues to be no different than what I think you're going to see different -- you're going to see different things happen in different regions and obviously, business and where we source grapes from is so diversified that we're going to see some ups and downs.", "It could be tight in Napa. You take a brand like just high-end peanut brand Meiomi we're sourcing, the great thing about Meiomi right, it's a three Appalachian brand meaning it comes from three different Appalachian which gives us a lot of flexibility with regard to the sourcing of those grapes and then obviously, we're continuing to source a lot of grapes from the Northern Central Valley from the central moderate.", "So, I think you're going to see some balancing there meaning you'll see some tightknit in some areas and you'll see some of the opposite in other areas and obviously also in the Pacific Northwest that's also important to us now as well as the brand like Charles West and Charles Smith, which is growing really high double-digits.", "And therefore, we're using a lot of the Washington supply right now, which was part of that deal, which we locked up, a lot of the Washington supply of premium wine grapes with the Charles Smith deal, which was one of the reasons that we thought it was a good deal and it's turning out to be a particularly good deal with Kung Fu Girl Riesling making capital 100 in the wine spectator and that kind of stuff really drives the growth of brands like that.", "Tim Ramey", "Okay. David, just two quick ones, any single point estimate on DNA for the total company for 2018 and then also on the new share compensation standard that increases shares outstanding slightly I believe and your share count forecast was a little higher than what I thought it would be. Can you quantify what that would be?", "David Klein", "Yes, so our share count estimate is really our best estimate as we sit here today right. So, it's inclusive of all of those points. And then Tim as it relates to depreciation and amortization I would say, you can think about the rest of the business as being fairly consistent, but we said that in the beer business that that number would be up about 50% year-over-year. So that's really the only change.", "Tim Ramey", "Okay. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from the line of Stephen Powers of UBS.", "Stephen Powers", "Hey great. Just two quick one\u2019s for you David. First just around the beer margin discussion, is there any way you can help better dimension the benefits you've seen with Glass Furnish Two coming online at Nava and what you expect for Glass Furnace Three and Four as you look forward?", "David Klein", "It's kind of hard to do in a real simple way right because as I said on $2 billion a COGS and mid $4 billion of sales and we can have $10 million, $15 million swing $20 million swings in both directions over a number of items.", "And so, there's definitely a benefit for bringing on furnace two and three and ultimately furnace four, but I think it really gets kind of absorbed into the overall margin numbers over time, because we're really talking about $15 million swings as opposed to $70 million when you bring up the furnace.", "You can't see those if you look at our NCI charge, on a year-over-year basis, we expect that number to double on a full-year basis to about $10 million and that just represents incremental profitability in our glass joint venture.", "Stephen Powers", "Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then finally on CapEx with the billion you're assuming for beer this is in fiscal '18 I believe that leaves $500 million to $600 million remaining across '19 and '20 this is what you said previously. Just want to confirm that's still the three-year aggregate assumption?", "And then as I think about that incremental call it $500 million to $600 million, should I -- should we consider that to be more or less evenly split across '19, '20, or is it going to be frontloaded loaded or is it too early to tell.", "David Klein", "So, the numbers that you quoted are roughly right. What I would say is that when we talk about a billion first of all, there's a range in that billion we just repaid. We picked kind of a point in there and I would say that that isn't all -- that's our entire beer capital number right, it's not necessarily all build out.", "So, the number over the next couple years is probably a little bit higher than the $600 you quoted I think, but it's not going to be material in the grand scheme of things.", "Stephen Powers", "Okay. That's fair enough, just wanted to clarify. Thank you.", "Operator", "And that was our final question. I'll now turn the floor back over to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks.", "Rob Sands", "Okay. Well thanks everyone for joining today's call. As we wrap up our discussion of the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 results, I want to emphasize how pleased I am with the excellent performance across all of our businesses.", "Our fiscal 2018 guidance shows we're very confident in our abilities to sustain profitable growth and we are firm in our commitment to build shareholder value. We look forward to the next time we speak with you in early July when we will share the results of our first quarter for our new fiscal year.", "Before then we hope you'll choose some of our fine products for your Spring celebrations including Cinco and Memorial Day weekend and of course enjoy them responsibily and speaking of Cinco, look for us at the New York Stock Exchange and on May 05 as we officially kick off our summer selling season by ringing the closing bell. Thanks, everybody and have a great rest of your day.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call.

Good morning and welcome to our first quarter fiscal 2018 conference call. I am Patty Yahn-Urlaub from Investor Relations and I\u2019m here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Klein, our Chief Financial Officer.", "As a reminder reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com.", "Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. ", "Before turning the call over to Rob, I would like to ask that we limit each Q&A session participant to one question, one versus two prior, which will help us to end our call on schedule. Thanks, in advance and now, here is Rob.", "Rob Sands", "Thank you, Patty. Good morning, and welcome to our discussion of Constellation's first quarter fiscal 2018 sales and earnings results. Our quarterly results reflect the continuation of our winning streak, as we produced results that delivered our 16th consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable EPS growth. I\u2019m also pleased to report that this morning we achieved a new all-time high stock price while significantly outperforming the S&P 500 so far this year.", "So let\u2019s get underway with a review of the business performance that delivered these fantastic results. We\u2019ll start with Constellation's beer business, which remained the number one growth driver in the high-end of the U.S. beer market, driving 60% of the growth of this market segment, while posting double-digit depletions and significantly improving margins. ", "Excellent execution during the Cinco de Mayo and Memorial Day holidays drove significant market share gains for the quarter. As a matter of fact, Constellation claimed 5 of the top 15 high-end share gainer spots during Cinco de Mayo with Modelo Especial coming in as a number one growth driver followed by Corona Extra in the number three spot and Pacifico rounding out the top five.", "During this quarter we increased media investments for Corona Extra and launched New English and Spanish language National TV campaigns including a new TV advertisement highlighting limited edition can packaging.", "Casa Modelo\u2019s flagship Modelo Especial brand is on fire, gaining distribution while delivering depletion growth of almost 20% for the first quarter. Also under the Casa Modelo Umbrella, we launched the new Modelo Chelada flavor, Tamarindo Picante which is supported with a fully integrated marketing and merchandising plan, as well as Modelo Chelada three packs both of which saw strong sales in the quarter.", "We expanded our national TV advertising efforts during the first quarter for the Pacifico brand, which posted depletion growth of 20%, representing an acceleration from where we ended fiscal 2017. And our new product entrance into the marketplace including Corona Premier and the Corona Familiar are showing strong performance in markets where they are currently available with velocities and consumer acceptance exceeding our expectations.

As we speak furnace number three is heating up at the Nava glass plant and is expected to be producing glass later this summer, right on schedule.", "The Obregon brewery continues to perform at its very high utilization level and we are optimizing existing Obregon capacity and packaging capabilities that are designed to increase output by early next year. These actions have allowed us to take a more measured approach from a timeline standpoint to the greenfield brewery site in Mexicali, while ensuring we have product supply to satisfy our growth expectations.", "Overall the strong results that the beer business achieved in the first quarter are driving the upward revision to our EPS guidance for the year. David will have more to say in this regard in a few moments.", "Turning now to Ballast Point, this business has not performed to expectations from a growth standpoint. As a result we recorded an impairment charge related to the trademark value of the acquired brands for the first quarter. However we remained committed to achieving our targeted return on investment for this acquisition. Ballast Point continues to gain distribution and is currently positioned as a top 20 craft brand in the U.S. market. ", "Going forward we are focused on the following; gaining greater distributor alignment with the goal of distributor network where possible, developing a more focused brand architecture led by the flagship Sculpin brand, investing in Ballast Point\u2019s first consumer marketing campaign and leveraging the import side of the beer business as well as other TBA resources within the company. ", "Overall craft beer continues to be one of the key growth segments within the U.S beer market. We plan to look for ways to leverage the Ballast Point craft beer platform, as it is an important part of our high-end strategy and we remain optimistic about the prospects for this business going forward.", "Now before we begin our discussion of results for our wine and spirits business, I\u2019d like to highlight our recent acquisition of Schrader Cellars, which is a California based fine wine company known for producing superior quality distinctive wines. These wines are sourced from the prestigious vineyards of Napa Valley, including the famed Beckstoffer To Kalon vineyards in Oakville, California.", "Schrader Cellars is America\u2019s highest rated, highest rated maker of Cabernet Sauvignon with 19, 100 point ratings from legendary critics like Robert Parker of the Wine Advocate, James Lobby of Wine Spectator and James Suckling.", "Today approximately 90% of Schrader\u2019s inventory is sold direct to consumers through an elite mailing list. The reminder is sold through distributor channels to select fine dining establishments with limited availability of approximately 4,000 cases per year. Schrader Cellars typically sells for 225 to 250 per bottles to customers on its mailing list.", "Overall this world class luxury wine portfolio adds cache to our newly established Fine Wine sales organization. It also provides an opportunity for us to advance our Fine Wine strategy and more fully compete in one of today's fastest growing wine segments, while optimizing our Napa assets and grape supply.", "During the first quarter our wine business maintained its IRI market share position and delivered excellent margin enhancement driven by a combination of favorable mix and price as well as benefits from our recent acquisition and divestiture activities and our ongoing cost of goods sold optimization initiatives.", "We have also made good progress against our innovation and renovation activities. After the successful renovation of Robert Mondavi Private Selection, which is currently growing at 10% in IRI channels, we recently re-launched brands including Clos du Bois, Estancia and Wild Horse. ", "And from an innovation perspective, we launched the new seven moons, Red Blend wine brand as well as Cooper & Thief, which has now become the number three luxury Red Wine brand.

Thank you.", "David Klein", "Thanks Rob and good morning, everyone. Fiscal \u201818 is off to a great start, our Q1 results demonstrated strong financial performance as we generated 7% organic net sales growth, expanded our consolidated comparable basis operating margin by 530 basis points and increased comparable basis EBIT by 22%.", "These results include particularly strong operational performance by our beer business, which is driving an increase in our full year comparable basis diluted EPS goal to a range of $7.90 to $8.10 per share. I'll discuss the drivers of this in a moment, but first let's look at Q1 performance and our full year outlook in more detail where I\u2019ll generally focus on comparable basis financial results.", "For beer, net sales increased 8% on volume growth of 7%. Depletion growth came in strong at 11.6% with excellent performance during the key Cinco and Memorial Day holidays. Shipment growth was below depletion growth primarily due to shipment timing.", "For Q2 fiscal \u201818 we expect shipment in depletion growth rates to be similar and as a reminder we are facing a difficult 14% depletion growth comparison for Q2 fiscal \u201817. For fiscal \u201818 we continue to expect net sales growth for the year to be in the 9% to 11% range this includes 1% to 2% of pricing targeted for our Mexican portfolio.", "Beer operating margin increased 470 basis points to 40.3%. This strong result exceeded our expectation and reflects lower COGS, foreign currency benefits and favorable pricing. The lower COGS reflect operational benefits, driven primarily by supply independence from ABI including better than planned performance at Obregon, lower materials including benefits from glass supply sourcing and lower freight costs.", "These benefits were partially offset by a $14 million increase in depreciation expense, which totaled $40 million for Q1. Given the strong operational performance we now expect beer operating income growth to be in the range of 13% to 15%.", "The expected moderation in beer operating income growth and margin for the remainder of the year versus Q1 is being primarily driven by the continued ramp up in depreciation, planned headcount addition to support our expanding operating platform, anticipated unfavorable foreign currency impact due to tougher peso comparisons in the back half of the year and lower benefits related to ABI supply agreement independence as the year progresses.", "For wine and spirits organic net sales increased 6%, this primarily reflects favorable mix in price as well as volume growth. U.S. depletions were down 1% and shipment volume outpaced depletions during the quarter due primarily to timing as we expect shipment and depletions to generally align for the full year.", "As Rob mentioned we have solid promotional and marketing program in place for key brands for the remainder of the year as part of our efforts to achieve our full year goals for the wine and spirits business. Wine and spirits operating margin increased 640 basis points for 29.7%. This improvement primarily reflects favorable mix in price with pricing benefiting from lower promotion spending due to timing, divestiture of the lower margin Canadian wine business and acquisition benefits.", "For the remainder of the year we expect to see moderation in our wine and spirits operating margin versus Q1, due primarily to higher promotion spending in support of the programming activities I just mentioned.", "For fiscal \u201818, we continue to expect wine and spirits reported net sales to decrease in the range of 4% to 6% and operating income to be flat. These projections include the negative impact of the Canadian wine business divestiture and the estimated incremental benefits from High West, Charles Smith and The Prisoner acquisitions.", "When excluding the impact of the Canadian wine business divestiture from our fiscal \u201817 wine and spirits results we continue to expect net sales growth of 4% to 6% and operating income growth of 5% to 7%. Interest expense for the year decreased 3% as the benefit of lower average interest rates was partially offset by higher average debt balances.", "We continue to expect fiscal year \u201818 interest expense to be in the range of $340 million to $350 million. When factoring in cash on hand our net debt at the end of May totaled $9 billion. This was level with our net debt balance at the end of fiscal \u201817. In early May we announced that we issued $1.5 billion of senior notes at attractive investment grade interest rates. These notes were comprised of three $500 million tranches with 5, 10 and 30 year terms and interest rates of 2.7%, 3.5% and 4.5% respectively.", "Proceeds from the offering were used to repay $700 million of 7.25% notes that were coming due in May and together with revolver borrowings we repaid the remaining balance of our U.S. Term A loan. Our net debt-to-comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio moved down to 3.5 times at the end of May from 3.7 times at the end of fiscal 2017. While we continue to invest in our Mexican operation and return cash to shareholders with $100 million of dividends paid in the first quarter.", "Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 19.4% versus 31.6% last year. This improvement reflects the benefit of reinvesting foreign current under APB 23 and the adoption of ASU 2016-09 which requires excess tax benefits from stock-based payment awards to be recognized in the income statement. As a reminder this benefit can fluctuate significantly depending on the timing and level of stock option exercises. As a result, we expect to see more volatility in our effective tax rate on an annual and quarterly basis.", "For fiscal 2018, we continue to expect the effective tax rate to approximate 22%. The full year effective tax rate is forecasted to be higher than the Q1 rate, primarily due to an anticipate decrease in quarterly stock-based award activity throughout the balance of the year. Historically Q1 has had the highest quarterly stock-based award activity. ", "For Q2 we are targeting the effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 25% range, I\u2019d also like to note for fiscal \u201818 we expect weighted average diluted shares outstanding to approximate $201 million and net income attributable to non-controlling interest to approximate $10 million. ", "As mentioned earlier, we are now projecting our full year comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $7.90 to $8.10. The midpoint of this guidance has is targeting 18% growth. Our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. This includes an $87 million non-cash impairment charge recorded during Q1 related to the Ballast Point trademarks. As Rob discussed earlier, we are optimistic about Ballast Point and remained focused on achieving our targeted return on that acquisition. ", "Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, we generated $165 million for the quarter. This was slightly below Q1 last year as double-digit operating cash flow growth was more than offset by an increase in CapEx.", "We continue to expect fiscal 2018 free cash flow to be in the range of $725 million to $825 million. This reflects operating cash flow in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion and CapEx of $1.175 billion to $1.275 billion, including approximately $1 billion of CapEx for our Mexico beer operations expansion. ", "In closing, our Cellar [ph] portfolio, strong business fundamentals and commitment to generating top tier sales and profit growth will position us to deliver another strong year of financial performance and build shareholder value in fiscal 2018. ", "With that Rob and I are happy to take your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. ", "Dara Mohsenian", "Hey, good morning guys. So my one question is around M&A, given the expected inflection in free cash flow over the next few years, can you discuss if you think M&A will become an increasing focus going forward, which of the business segments you might be most interested in for M&A. The relative size of deals you\u2019re generally looking at. And then financially just remind us for the key criteria?", "Rob Sands", "Yes, so I would say that our M&A strategy remains the same and I would refer you back to our capital allocation strategy in general, which continues to focus on keeping our debt levels sort of in that 3.5 range, returning moneys to shareholders in the form of share repurchases, dividends and dividend increases. And selective M&A mostly or I should say almost entirely of tuck-in type brands more of the Meiomi kind of nature.", "So, we just made one Schrader, which I mentioned. So we are going to continue pretty much along that path, we\u2019ll look for brands across actually beer, wine and spirits that we think fills niches that we don't have, that we think are highly synergistic with the platforms that we have across those three segments. I would say really nothing at all has changed and I don't expect anything different than what we've been doing.", "Dara Mohsenian", "Great. Thanks, it's helpful.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.", "Rob Sands", "Hi, Vivien.", "Vivien Azer ", "Hi, good morning. So, given how robust your trends are, it really stands in very sharp contrast to some of the softening that we're seeing kind of more broadly in the beer category for a number of your competitors? So, a two part question please. Number one, if you could kind of just give us your view of what's happening more broadly in beer?", "And then number two, given this evolution in the competitive dynamic, how does that inform your optimism around distribution gains? Because I would think given how strong your growth is, it should facilitate that conversation with retailers. Thanks.", "Rob Sands", "Sure. Now, we've said no two part question, but for your benefit I'll combine that into one answer, okay. First of all what -- because I think it is really one answer. Broadly what's going on in beer alright is you see beer as a generally flat to slightly down market. We believe that the whole beer market in general is fairly tied to the growth or lack thereof and LDAs, legal drinking age, people of 21, that\u2019s flattish and therefore we see beer as flat.", "However, within beer there is a significant shift going on away from the domestic premiums, the Bud Light, the Coors Light, Miller Light towards the high-end and that's a pretty stark shift that's going on. The beneficiaries in the high-end are largely our portfolio and craft, which continues to be a fairly robust category and continues to grow. And then our business, which is about the same size as craft, the whole craft segment and of course our business remains the most robust portion of the wine business.", "So, you see the domestic premiums in decline and then you see our portfolio craft and some SMBs like Mike\u2019s taking that all up. And as you\u2019ve seen or read in our previous conferences, we\u2019ve pretty much shown the actual analytics behind how we think that that's going to play out in the future with the domestic dropping quite a bit and our portfolio picking up a lot of that. And of course you see it in IRI where we picked up - Constellation constituted 60% of the growth in the beer market. So, what we've said is going to happen in the past is in fact happening.", "I think that fundamentally answers your question.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.", "Rob Sands", "Hi, Nik.", "Nik Modi ", "Hi, good morning everyone. So, on Corona Premier, it looks like these test markets are progressing fairly well. How much time do you guys need before you can make an assessment on a national launch? And then just housekeeping item, what were the shipments and depletions in beer ex-Ballast Point if you could give us that number?", "David Klein", "So on that Nik, the Ballast Point was about a 50 basis points drag on depletions for total beer.", "Nik Modi ", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong\u2026 ", "Patty Yahn-Urlaub", "Is the national rollout of premier\u2026 ", "Rob Sands", "Yes, so I didn\u2019t answer the national rollout for Corona Premier and Familiar, both I would say are actually exceeding our expectations in test market. We haven\u2019t made a decision on an actual date for national rollout, but I would expect that decision to come fairly soon and I would say that it's likely to be a favorable decision on national rollout. So, that's about as much as we can say at the moment but\u2026", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.", "Rob Sands", "Hi, Judy.", "Judy Hong ", "Thank you. Hi, so I guess I have to ask a beer margin question. So clearly 40% pretty impressive here. David just I think your comment about this may not be sustainable for the balance of the year, so just trying to get a little bit more color around that. DNA and pricing I think is essentially a wash, the peso I guess is becoming a little bit of a headwind, but when you talk about the headcount increase that\u2019s potentially a headwind, can you just elaborate on - sort of quantify what that means? Can you compare the brewery margins for Piedras and Obregon and other kind of headwinds you\u2019re envisioning for the balance of the year?", "David Klein ", "Yes, so the first thing I want to say is that the operations teams at Nava and at Obregon performed exceptionally well in the first quarter while the plants were operating at high utilization levels. And I would say that a portion of our rational really for increasing our EBIT growth rate for beer was really we have been pleased by the lack of transition friction at Obregon that we have perhaps expected going into the year.", "So now for the remainder of the year I would -- Judy I think the biggest headwind that we see is really coming from FX in the business. In Q1 on a year-over-year basis in Q1 we actually had a bit of tailwind from FX. But we know that right now the peso is sitting below 18 pesos to the dollar. And we disclosed in the beginning of the year that our guidance was based around 20 pesos to the dollar that presents a pretty significant headwind for us. ", "Beyond that we also mentioned depreciation that\u2019s quantifiable right, because we have already said that our depreciation is expected to up about $60 million on the year. And then we have as we get -- as we move through the year we\u2019re bringing in more -- as we bring more equipment online we are bringing in about 300 additional heads, which will put a bit of a drag on our business. At the same time the utilization starts to fall up in the plants, right, because remember we run them at high utilization throughout Q1 and Q2 and then it drops off a little bit at the back half for the year. And then I know I say this every single time we talk about margins, but you just have to continue expect volatility in our margins as we try to optimize the lines and brew [trends] [ph] that we bring into service over the course of the year. ", "So, we are really happy to have achieved 40% operating margins in Q1 and I guess I will say Judy you kind of called that before anybody else, but we do have to be careful because there are some significant and real headwinds for the rest of the year.", "Judy Hong ", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.", "Andrea Teixeira", "Hi, thank you. Just going back to the point about the cadence of beer during the quarter and there has been obviously a lot of volatility especially from your competitors and your shipments have been lower than depletions, which obviously is a nature of the business itself. But can you comment on the cadence throughout the quarter and if you are seeing acceleration of the shipment as you\u2019re going through your second quarter? Thank you.", "David Klein", "Yes, I think Andrea the real disconnect in Q1 really was because of the strength of our depletions coming out of Cinco and then going into the Memorial Day Holiday and it\u2019s just the timing issue in terms of getting our shipments to align. Not necessarily on a growth rate basis but on a case rate basis we expect shipments and depletions in beer to align over the course of the year there\u2019ll just be fluctuations between the quarters.", "Andrea Teixeira", "And a one last follow-up question, sorry, because it was about like the previous question on the FX. From what I understand you're hedged -- from your K, you\u2019re hedging about 50% of your exposure, correct to the peso at the [indiscernible] level and the rest is actually floating.", "David Klein", "Well so about half of our currency exposure for the remainder of the year is hedged, it\u2019s hedged at a very -- at various different levels, but it\u2019s in included the hedges that we have is included in our outlook. We value the contracts at the same time we are valuing the remaining exposures.", "Andrea Teixeira", "And you also including that effect on your financial expenses, right. Your outlook for your financial expenses includes the cost of the hedges and the resets of the hedges, correct?", "David Klein", "Yes correct, correct.", "Andrea Teixeira", "Okay, perfect. Thank you so much, appreciate. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Powers of UBS.", "Stephen Powers", "Great thanks. A question on Pacifico and the plans there, just given what you\u2019re seeing from the broader market competitively both old and new competitors and I think the most obvious new catalysts is still moving into most in course hands. Does that change at all how you\u2019re thinking about the timing and or approach to the ramp up of Pacifico overtime?", "Rob Sands", "No, not at all. There\u2019s always a few Mexican brands that are being introduced by various parties whether it\u2019s Molson Coors or ABI, I mean, that\u2019s not going to change. And what I\u2019ve emphasized about that is that the large part of the growth in the beer business is in our portfolio a lot of people talked about it as it imports or in Mexican while it\u2019s really Constellation\u2019s imports in Mexican portfolio.", "So these other entrants don\u2019t really concern us very much. And sales been around forever and might sell I don\u2019t know a 200,000 cases in the entire United States. So I don\u2019t see this particularly important.", "Now Pacifico you asked about that, Pacifico is just also on fire, without are frankly doing too much to drive it and we\u2019re ramping up on our plants to drive Pacifico and we sort of see this perhaps the next big thing right behind Modelo Especial, I mean, we have a lot of sort of anecdotal evidence as far as some market research that indicates the consumer acceptance of the product is wildly overwhelming.", "Historically we didn\u2019t drive it because we didn\u2019t have the capacity to do anything more than what we\u2019re doing we now have the capacity it\u2019s coming on stream and Pacifico is definitely the next logical thing that really drive behind Corona and Modelo Especial. So we\u2019re I\u2019d say extremely optimistic about that.", "In addition to our NPD, Premier I think has a huge amount of promise and Familiar is like a phenomena already. So we\u2019re excited about all three things.", "Stephen Powers", "Perfect, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Nicolaus.", "Mark Swartzberg", "Yes, thanks. My one question wine and spirits margins it\u2019s only one quarter, but they\u2019re dramatically above the way we all on this tree modeled it and yet you haven\u2019t changed your full year margin view. My question is obviously we could have just gotten the modeling wrong, but to what extent did you consider the first quarter disappointing from a revenue perspective and what else has prompted you not to increase the margin guide for that portion of your business?", "David Klein", "Well so first Mark the thing that I think is becoming or should be becoming more and more obvious is that while there is a lot of focus on the beer business our wine and spirits business is a very powerful business with margins that are approaching 30 and we\u2019ve stated publicly that our goal is to get them to 30. So what\u2019s tempering our expectations for the remainder of the year are really two things, one is we got about 200 basis points of year-over-year improvement in wine margins as a result of the sale of the Canadian business. ", "For the full year that 200 basis points is more like 100 right because we sold the wine business before the end of last -- well before the end of last fiscal year. So there\u2019s 100 basis points of that benefit that goes away over the course of the remainder of the year.", "And the second thing is you might recall that our promotions expense is accrued based upon depletions not shipments. So we got some benefit in the quarter because of the difference between our shipments number and our depletions number. So we\u2019re very optimistic about wine margins and our guidance for the year assumes that there is wine margin leverage. And so we remained committed to that, we\u2019re just remaining cautious because of the two items I mentioned. ", "Mark Swartzberg", "And would it be fair to say that because depletions were down, they were disappointing versus your plan?", "David Klein", "I would say that we\u2019re on track to achieve our guidance for the year. As Rob called out in his script, we had some planned promotion timing differences that affected our depletions in the first quarter, now clearly we never want negative depletions, but we remained confident in our full year guidance.", "Mark Swartzberg", "Great, thanks David. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Pablo Zuanic of SIG.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, it\u2019s actually Yatish [ph] in for Pablo. Just one question, in regards to your typical retail store, would you able to comment on average, how many skews you would have for Corona versus Modelo Especial, is it like one-to-one, three-to-one, any kind of rough idea would be helpful. Thanks.", "Rob Sands", "In the company we have very few skews is a general preposition, but I don\u2019t know the answer exactly to your question, how many skews of Corona do we have versus Modelo Especial, we will get back to you on that. Patty will give you.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research.", "Tim Ramey", "Thanks so much. So, as I recall these are the best ever margins in wine and beer and as spectacular as they are, it really the biggest news I think in the quarter is the ability to issue this debt at amazing rates, which gives you a tremendous amount of optionality in the M&A market. Rob you kind of soft pedal debt saying it\u2019s incremental, it\u2019s tuck-ins but there was a rumor of a very large deal this quarter and it seems like with your current balance sheet, you may be really well positioned to do a major deal. Can you talk about not anything specific, but the optionality of significant deal?", "Rob Sands", "Yes, I mean I think that it remains fundamentally as I said, which is I think the real opportunity is brands and tuck-in deals and that\u2019s something that we can keep doing and do it and meet our financial disciplines which is important part of that, I mean, we buy brands like Meiomi or other brands we can tuck it into our existing infrastructure.", "These things are growing very high double-digits and we are buying them at reasonable multiples, which post synergies are multiples that generate actually a high return. So I\u2019d say fundamentally that strategy versus buying something really big is a good strategy from a financial perspective and from the perspective of positioning our portfolios across wine, beer and spirits for continued growth, which -- growth and margins, which is -- that\u2019s really the strategy, right.", "Is to keep driving this kind of growth and these kind of margins and the kind of leverage that we\u2019re seeing in our P&L by at least as it relates to M&A now there is other elements of it like NPD, things like term premier and familiar, but as it relates to the M&A we can keep sort of adding on a very financially viable basis these kind of brands.", "Now, as far as anything big goes, there is two issues there, one is there is nothing for sale and two, there is very little that would be of any interest even if it was for sell fundamentally for three reasons, right. There is financial element of it will it generate kind of return that we wanted to generate, And then number two, we go back to sales, growth and margins there is very few big things that when potentially be somewhat dilutive to our sales growth and to our margins.", "So we would tread pretty carefully on anything like that. So yes in the end we\u2019re talking about big things you can count it on a half a hand right, there not much in the business.", "David Klein", "I would also add to that Rob that\u2026", "Rob Sands", "And you can exclude ABI.", "David Klein", "And I would add to that\u2026", "Rob Sands", "They don\u2019t have the growth either, but they do have the margin.", "David Klein", "Last year we bought $1.2 billion of our own stock back at $151 a share. So we still think we\u2019re the best buy in alcohol.", "Rob Sands", "Yes that\u2019s looking pretty good right now that investment.", "Tim Ramey", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore. ", "Robert Ottenstein", "First off just congratulations on a terrific quarter. If you give a little bit of clarity there\u2019s just a question that I have around guidance in a comment that you made Rob earlier on if I got it right and that is despite raising the EPS guidance it looks like you\u2019re keeping your cash flow guidance flat. There was also comment that you said early on that the progress you\u2019re making I think you said at Obregon and some of the other facilities was allowing you to moderate the rollout or the expenditures in Mexicali if I got that right. So I'm just trying to put those items together to think through what your cash flow guidance means here.", "Rob Sands", "Yes so I\u2019ll let David answer a part of this question, but my comment about Obregon and Mexicali was just really more of the same in other words the guidance that we\u2019ve given thus far on our CapEx as it relates to Mexicali and Obregon hasn\u2019t changed.", " And we basically told you about that when we acquired Obregon we basically said that we were going to cut Mexicali the initial first stage of it back to $5 million hectoliters because we didn\u2019t need to go to full $10 million hectoliters on Mexicali given that we bought almost that amount in Obregon and we\u2019ll have that amount as we make some small modifications to Obregon.", "So there\u2019s really no difference put it this way between what we said previously at the end of the year and what we\u2019re saying now we\u2019re just in essence repeating ourselves. And then as to your point on EPS and cash flow I\u2019ll let David talk about that.", "David Klein", "Yes, so Robert I think on total cash flow guidance the largest lever as you\u2019re pointing out is our capital expenditures. And I would just say that one quarter into the year it\u2019s too early to call any changes there. But we clearly carefully manage our working capital and our CapEx spend to optimize those numbers.", "Robert Ottenstein", "Terrific, thank you very much, very helpful.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Credit Suisse.", "Laurent Grandet", "Good morning, everyone. So with approximately 75% of retail market share in Mexican beer, could you give us some comfort us to why you think retailers will give you more shelves, more market share? Not usually their typical mindset to put all the eggs in one basket usually now that there is a bit more competition coming in Mexican beer? Thank you.", "Rob Sands", "Yes I think it\u2019s fairly simple and that is that our shelf space relative our market share greatly under indexes. I mean, I can\u2019t even tell you what that number is, but we have a much smaller percentage of the shelf in the store than we have in the market share and the proposition is simple, okay. Increase our shelf space and you\u2019ll sell more of our beer and it\u2019s not just shelf space it\u2019s cold box space as well versus giving that space to declining low margin product.", "So you get two choices, right, you can give the space to us and sell more of a high margin item or give the space to somebody else and watch your sales and velocity and your margins decline. So, as I go around and talk to retailers, they get that, okay. And I can tell you right now, retailers need to do a significant rethinking of their assortment in beer.", "Fundamentally their beer assortments make no sense anymore for them. On the assumption that their goal is to improve their sales and margin as a business, okay. It makes no sense; they have 20% of the store allocated to 5 billion craft that nobody has ever heard of. And then to have the vast majority of the rest of the store allocated to low margin declining brands and then a smaller amount of the store allocated to fast moving high margin, high end brands it just doesn\u2019t make any sense.", "And so, I think you'll see a change in that and we're certainly driving as the high-end leader in beer. We hopefully will be driving that change because I think it\u2019s a change that has to happen sooner or later and that's going to dictate probably as that change occurs, you\u2019ll actually see these trends in beer they\u2019ll actually accelerate, which is part of the reason why it doesn\u2019t occur.", "Because those who are hanging on are trying desperately to hang on to everything that they've got to mitigate precisely that scenario. And for us it's just a gigantic opportunity because we're punching under our weight. So we have the opportunity to not only generate the kind of performance that we've been generating, but enhance that performance if we could start -- if we could get retailers to understand and act, they understand it, it\u2019s getting them to act on it.", "So -- and we're having some success in that regard and we expect to have more success in the future. And I think you'll see retailers start rethinking their assortment in beer to take advantage of the high-end and Constellation opportunity in particular.", "Laurent Grandet", "Thank you very much, Rob.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust.", "Stephanie Spinner", "Hi, good afternoon. This is actually Stephanie on for Bill. I\u2019m just trying to get an understanding on the wine business organic growth. So obviously you are entering your first and second year after your Prisoner and Meiomi acquisitions. So, how much of the growth in the quarter is coming from distribution gains and should we start to see some tougher comps in the remainder of the year? Or I guess kind of put in other way is the growth coming from distribution gains kind of compared to the overall growth of the market? So just more color there would be helpful. Thanks.", "Rob Sands", "Yes, I would say fundamentally organic growth it's hard -- that's an interesting number that's hard to get at. But I think that you can fundamentally look at IRI as the best measure of our organic growth, which I think that the markets growing sort of low single-digit right now call it in that 3% type range with 200 basis points of price mix and we expect to grow in line with that organically and fundamentally with some quarter-to-quarter type fluctuations.", "But I think we feel fairly confident that that's what the years going to end up looking like in general. And our ships and our depletes will equal each other by year-end. And as I said, I think that you will see sort of a conversions between ships, depletes and IRI in our wine business. That sort of how things are shaping up, which is good.", "I mean, I think a strong performance, especially given the profitability of that business and the fact that we can then leverage we think that we\u2019ll be able to leverage that as we\u2019ve guided to generate higher even higher bottom-line return. So it\u2019s very, very strong business in many respects.", "I always like to say that it\u2019s only in contrast to the beer business that these questions even get raised, I mean, as a standalone business generating 30% margins sort of almost mid-single-digit sales growth, leveraging the P&L, if you weren\u2019t looking at it in contrast to our beer business you would be running around saying, this is one of the best businesses that there is.", "So, even looking at ROIC, which nobody even talks about anymore, I don\u2019t know why, but our ROIC in wine is up in the double-digits. And then if you look at the accretion of ROIC it\u2019s like high-teens low 20s, 20% return on invested capital for any incremental growth that we have in our wine business.", "So by almost any standard that you can imagine it\u2019s a tremendous business, nothing looks like it expect for other alcoholic beverage companies and too many of them in tobacco. I mean, that\u2019s about it and tobacco to tobacco. Then it\u2019s all downhill from there. So it\u2019s at the pinnacle of performance pretty much, other than our beer business and a couple of other perhaps.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of Macquarie. ", "Caroline Levy ", "Good morning everyone and congrats. Just digging into your core portfolio, could you tell us how Corona performed as well as Corona Light just to get a sense of your flagship brand -- sorry Modelo Especial and Corona Light? And then just as a major of success for Premier are you looking at it in terms of how much share it takes or whether it impacts Ultra or how are you thinking about things when you said doing well?", "David Klein", "Yes so, so actually Rob in his script talked about say Modelo Especial approaching 20% depletion growth. Corona Extra was in that 6% range and Corona Light was a little bit less than that. So all of the brands are performing quite well, and Rob maybe you want to take the Premier question. ", "Rob Sands", "Yes, I think that Premier looks very strong. We are looking at things like velocities per point of distribution, which appear to be very strong. Cannibalization is not something we\u2019re overly concern with because there is really no margins disadvantage. And so as long as one plus one equals three, we are okay with that, now we don\u2019t want cannibalization of something that\u2019s good with something that\u2019s not going to be sustainable.", "So the big key is just making sure that we believe that from a consumer acceptance point of view that Premier represents a sustainable and growing preposition, which right now I would say our preliminary read on that is that it\u2019s looking pretty good in terms of the contributions that it can make, its sustainability, it's positioning in the marketplace. I mean, well needless to say what are the hardest brands in beer, right of any size.", "The hardest brands in beer they size are basically Corona, Modelo Especial and Mic Ultra, okay. Premier is a more upscale, more premium competitor to Mic Ultra with the power and this is probably a very important point, right. Because anybody can make a beer with that the calorie and the carb characteristics of Mic Ultra. But with the power of an elite brand behind it with all of the consumer acceptance and recognition that goes with it.", "So it\u2019s definitely a segment of the market that I think is hot, it\u2019s here to stay, it\u2019s what been driving Mic Ultra, I think it\u2019s going to drive Corona Premier as well, because it's got the characteristic. The liquid in the bottle is great, obviously we test all that and we test it against competitors and we test it with consumers who drink that kind of beer, okay. And we have extremely positive results on that.", "So, I think it\u2019s looking very good and it\u2019s a point to remember that, right. It\u2019s consumers, the Premier is started the consumers who drink that kind of beer and are looking for precisely that profile of product. So if are a IITA drinker yes, of course you are not drinking Mic Ultra and you\u2019re not going to drink Premier.", "On the other hand, if you are Mic Ultra drinker I think Premier makes a -- is a nice alternative to that in every respect.", "Operator", "Thank you, I will now return the call to Rob Sands, for any additional or closing remarks.", "Rob Sands", "So, thank you very much everybody for joining today\u2019s call. I want to reiterate how very pleased we are with the fantastic execution that drove our excellent first quarter results, and my kudos to our people, our distributors, our retailers who continue to be part of the virtual cycle that drive those results.", "We are very optimistic about our future business opportunities which gives us the confidence to raise our full year EPS guidance. And as we head into the July 4th holiday weekend, I hope you remember to drink some of our fine wine products, as well as beer products and spirits products to your celebrations and to please enjoy them responsibly. So thank you and everyone should have a great 4th of July weekend.", "Operator", "Thank you. That does conclude the Constellation Brands first quarter 2018 earnings conference call.

(NYSE:STZ) Q3 2018 Earnings Conference Call January  5, 2017 10:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Patty Yahn-Urlaub - VP, IR", "Robert Sands - CEO, President & Director", "David Klein - EVP & CFO", "Analysts", "Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley", "Sunil Modi - RBC Capital Markets", "Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company", "Robert Ottenstein - Evercore ISI", "Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company", "Eunjoo Hong - Goldman Sachs Group", "Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities", "Timothy Ramey - Pivotal Research Group", "Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank AG", "Andrea Teixeira - JPMorgan Chase & Co.", "Caroline Levy - Macquarie Research", "William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Operator", "Welcome to the Constellation Brands Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Patty Yahn-Urlaub", "Thank you, Lori. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2018 conference call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Klein, our Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call. Before turning the call over to Rob, similar to prior quarters I\u2019d like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person which will have us end our call on schedule. Thanks in advance. And now here's Rob.", "Robert Sands", "Thank you, Patty, and good morning, and Happy New Year. I hope you enjoyed the holidays and had the opportunity to include some of our fine Constellation products in your celebrations with family and friends. As I reflect on 2017, I am reminded that it has been a dynamic time for our business. We posted another year of exceptional stock price performance, with Constellation stock increasing almost 50% for the calendar year 2017 versus the S&P 500, which grew about 20% for the year. Overall, stars, Constellation was one of the best performers among the S&P 500 Consumer Staples stocks.", "I believe our excellent stock price performance continues to be driven by our strong financial results and the ongoing growth prospects for our business. The confidence in our future business prospects compelled us to seek board authorization for a new multiyear $3 billion share repurchase program subsequent to the recent repurchases of more than 200 million of our outstanding shares. I'm also excited about our recent investment in Canopy Growth Corporation, the largest publicly traded cannabis supplier in the world and a leader in the medical cannabis market in Canada. Founded in 2014 and based in Ontario, Canopy Growth is one of the earliest commercial players in Canada's legal cannabis market and has a global presence via numerous joint ventures and partnerships. Canopy is traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange and currently has a market cap in the $5 billion range.", "This investment provides Constellation with a first-mover advantage for a potentially significant emerging consumer opportunity and aligns with our long-term strategy to identify, meet and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics while maintaining focus on our core total beverage alcohol business. Our plan is to jointly collaborate with Canopy in a number of areas. Initially, we will be learning the cannabis business and the related consumer space and route-to-market while building and developing a successful cannabis beverage business.", "Now recreational cannabis is scheduled to become legal in Canada this coming summer with recreational edibles including beverages expected to become legal in the summer of 2019. We have no current plans to sell cannabis products in the U.S. or any other market, and we will not consider doing so until it is legal at all levels of government.", "Our initial investment of approximately $190 million represents an ownership interest of 9.9% of Canopy Growth plus warrants which give Constellation the option to purchase an additional ownership interest in the future. In a few moments, David will review how we are accounting for this investment.", "And speaking of growth prospects, we posted another great quarter for our beer business, which generated 80% of the total U.S. beer category growth and claimed four of the top 10 share-gainer positions with Modelo Especial, Corona Extra, Modelo Chelada, Tamarindo Picante and Pacifico. Overall, Constellation's beer business remains the leader in the high end of the U.S. beer market and was the clear winner for the Labor Day and Thanksgiving holidays, with excellent execution that drove share gains led by Corona Extra and Modelo Especial. These brands continue to drive the growth of the portfolio with ongoing distribution and velocity gains. Throughout the quarter, Corona Extra maintained strong media support and became the official imported beer of four NFL teams while also featuring Jon Gruden in football promotions during the season.", "Corona Extra also increased relevance with Hispanic consumers through its partnerships with Latin music superstars Enrique Iglesias and Man\u00e1. The Modelo Especial fighting spirit campaign continued throughout our third quarter including national TV and promotional activities during the NFL schedule. In addition, national Spanish-language TV support ran through November including a strong presence with live soccer program and top-rated Spanish language TV networks. Social media on Facebook and Instagram also supported NFL, the Mexican Independence Day and the Dia de los Muertos for this brand. Collectively, these initiatives drove depletion growth of almost 17% for the Modelo Especial family of brands for our third quarter.", "Pacifico continues to make its mark within our portfolio and recently was named Impact Beer Brand of the Year by Market Watch. In addition, Pacifico has become the fastest, the fastest-growing beer brand among the top 40 beer brands based on 52-week IRI dollar growth of nearly 24%. Our plans for Corona Premier and Corona Familiar continue to evolve as we finalize our launch strategies for next year. Corona Premier is the first national Corona line extension in more than 25 years, and we plan to make our largest-ever launch investment of more than 35 million to support the effort.", "This includes a robust media plan with general market and Spanish language TV advertising beginning in April. Additional support will include print, social media and Hispanic-targeted advertising as well as on-premise sampling and new point-of-sale materials. Corona Familiar will roll out during the same time frame to major Hispanic markets, a key demographic for this brand.", "Now turning to the operations side of the beer business. During the quarter, we continued to make progress as we put the finishing touches on our Nava capacity addition to complete the 27.5 million hectoliter expansion while also nearing the finishing line with our fourth glass furnace, both of which are expected to come online in the coming months. Glass furnace three is now fully operational and running at peak efficiency levels. The Obregon brewery continues to perform at a very high utilization level, and we remain on track with our brewing and packaging capacity additions, which are expected to be completed before the end of the fiscal year. And construction continues in Mexicali with brewhouse tank fabrication and installation currently under way.", "During the quarter, we reached agreement with Owens-Illinois to restructure and expand our contracts for glass supply including our joint venture agreement. As you know, the joint venture operates a glass production plant in Nava, Mexico and provides bottles exclusively for Constellation's adjacent brewery, which is our lowest-cost source of supply for glass. The original joint venture agreement included the expansion of the glass production plant from one furnace to four furnaces, and initial expansion plans have been progressing as scheduled, as I just mentioned.", "The expanded relationships with OI provides for the addition of a fifth furnace, which is expected to come online by the end of calendar 2019 and will be included in our future capital investment plans. Following the installation of the fifth furnace, the Nava plant will be the largest, most modern glass container facility in the world. In recognition of the value-added contributions from both partners, the term of the joint venture agreement has also been extended for an additional 10 years to 2034. David will discuss the high-level details of this new contract in a few moments.", "Now turning to the wine and spirits business. It certainly has been an interesting quarter for our wine and spirits division. Early in the quarter, hurricanes hit some of our key markets. And shortly thereafter, we were faced with one of the worst natural disasters in California state history as we dealt with widespread wildfires in Northern California. Overall, we are fortunate that these events are expected to have only a minor impact in our business both near term and in the future. To put things in perspective, about 80% of the harvest was already completed when the wildfires started, and less than 5% of our wine portfolio is Napa or Sonoma appellated. Constellation has a long history in Napa and Sonoma, and we're committed to helping our neighbors and our communities rebuild by driving consumer engagement and continuing to encourage purchase and consumption of Napa and Sonoma wines. Please help us support this effort.", "Third quarter wine and spirits depletions were a bit muted following a strong finish to our second quarter. Key Focus Brands drove depletion growth led by double-digit trends for Kim Crawford, Meiomi, Black Box, Ruffino, Robert Mondavi Private Selection and High West Whiskey. Throughout the quarter, our focused investments for some of these brands were visible in the marketplace and drove excellent results, including the first-ever national TV advertising campaign for Kim Crawford, which drove accelerating growth trends for this brand during the key holiday selling season.", "Now on a year-to-date basis, the business is expanding margins, generating positive mix, driving innovation and seeing excellent results from acquired brands including Meiomi, The Prisoner, Charles Smith and High West. And our innovation efforts are paying off with successes like Cooper & Thief, which has become the #2 super-luxury red blend; and Robert Mondavi Private Selection Bourbon Barrel-Aged Cabernet and Chardonnay, which together are growing more than 120% in IRI channels.", "I'm also pleased to report that Constellation Ventures has been busy, recently making two minority investments, both of which align with our strategy of investing in emerging unique and distinctive brands. The first is The Real McCoy, a high-end rum aged in American oak bourbon barrels. This line of 3, 5 and 12 year aged rum is produced by Richard Seale, a legendary fourth-generation master distiller and made at Foursquare Distillery in Barbados. This product has a premium price point of the $20 to $50 range and uses an authentic farm-to-glass production process using high-quality blackstrap molasses with no added sugars, flavors or aromas.", "The second is Copper & Kings, a high-end American craft brandy founded in 2014 in Louisville, Kentucky. These brandies are naturally distilled in copper pot stills, and the liquid is matured in Kentucky bourbon barrels and retails for $35 a bottle.", "While the U.S. wine industry remains healthy overall with trends that continue to exceed U.S. CPG category growth, we have seen a bit of a slowdown in the market growth rate versus what we anticipated when we set our original guidance estimates earlier this year. In addition, our SKU rationalization efforts are creating a headwind as we continue to carefully rationalize our portfolio of tail brands. Despite these challenges, we are targeting wine and spirits net sales and EBIT growth for fiscal 2018 at the low end of our previous stated guidance ranges of 4% to 6% and 5% to 7%, respectively.", "Before I turn the call over to David, I'd like to take a moment to address the topic of tax reform. As a U.S.-based beverage alcohol company, Constellation has been supportive of tax reform that allows U.S. companies to remain competitive globally. While we continue to review the legislation, we are very pleased with the outcome of this historic legislation and believe that it'll be very positive for us going forward. David will provide additional details in a few minutes.", "In closing, it is certainly shaping up to be yet another eventful year at Constellation. With the fiscal year quickly drawing to a close, I am very pleased with our progress to date. We established a first-mover advantage in emerging consumer category with our Canopy Growth investment, and we continue to make smart investments including the planned addition of a fifth furnace at our glass plant in Nava. We continue to build shareholder value through ongoing share repurchases and stock appreciation driven by our strong results and future business prospects. And I am pleased with the outcome of tax reform legislation. We look forward to leveraging the opportunities that this will bring for our business and continue to thrive.", "With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to David, who will review our financial results for the third quarter.", "David Klein", "Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here with you today to discuss another quarter of strong execution. On a year-to-date basis, we've grown market share, expanded margins and improved our capital structure while investing in growth initiatives that will benefit us as we go forward.", "Our fiscal '18 year-to-date comparable basis diluted EPS is up 29% versus last year. Q3 comparable basis diluted EPS increased 2%. The low Q3 EPS growth rate was primarily due to timing as we're increasing our full year comparable basis diluted EPS guidance to a range of $8.40 to $8.50 from $8.25 to $8.40. This improvement is primarily due to anticipated favorability in our full year tax rate and better margin performance in our beer business, which I'll talk about in a moment. We now expect our fiscal '18 comparable effective tax rate to approximate 20% versus our previous 21% guidance. Our EPS and tax rate guidance excludes any impacts from recently enacted tax reform.", "Before I move further into our results, let me provide some comments on the new tax legislation. First of all, we're pleased with the bill that was enacted and want to thank our friends in Congress for their work to reform the corporate tax code. Like most companies, we're in the process of evaluating the specific impacts of tax reform, but it is clearly favorable to our previous low to mid-20s long-term effective tax rate guidance. For fiscal '18, we expect to benefit in our U.S. federal statutory tax rate. The new 21% corporate tax rate will apply for the last two months of our fiscal year, resulting in a lower blended statutory tax rate versus the historical 35% rate.", "We expect the new tax legislation, including the impact of the tax rate deduction -- or reduction and the transition to a territorial system of taxation will result in a reduction in our existing net deferred tax liabilities by $300 million to $400 million. This onetime noncash benefit will be reported in our fourth quarter fiscal '18 results and will be excluded from our comparable basis financial results. We expect to provide an update to our long-term effective tax rate guidance as part of our upcoming investor presentation at the CAGNY conference in late February.", "Now let's take a closer look at Q3 performance and our full year outlook, where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. For beer, we continued to see strong operational performance and robust marketplace momentum. Depletion growth came in at 9% as we won the Labor Day and Thanksgiving holidays. This result was in line with our depletion growth performance year-to-date and our high-single digit depletion growth target for fiscal '18.", "Net sales increased 8% on volume growth of 6%. Depletion growth ran ahead of shipment growth primarily due to timing. Year-to-date shipments grew more than 8%, putting us on track to meet our net sales target for fiscal '18 as we continue to expect net sales growth to be in the 9% to 11% range. This includes 1% to 2% of pricing benefit in our Mexican beer portfolio. Beer operating margin increased 290 basis points to 37.7% primarily due to lower COGS and favorable pricing. The lower COGS reflect operational benefits driven by glass and material sourcing along with foreign currency favorability. These benefits were partially offset by a $12 million increase in depreciation expense, which totaled $42 million for Q3. We now expect beer operating margin -- or beer operating income growth to be in the range of 18% to 19%. Although we're increasing our guidance to the upper end of our previous range, our Q4 operating margin is expected to moderate primarily due to lower seasonal production volume combined with the continued ramp-up in depreciation, line commissioning costs and headcount additions. In addition, SG&A leverage is expected to be impacted by the seasonality of the business.", "For wine and spirits, organic net sales were flat due primarily to mix benefits being mostly offset by lower volumes. Operating margin decreased 110 basis points to 26.2% as mix benefits from portfolio premiumization efforts were more than offset by higher COGS and marketing investments. The higher COGS primarily reflect higher operational costs including increased transportation costs and the overlap of a supplier cost reimbursement in Q3 last year. We expect to realize benefits from the increased marketing spend on brands like Kim Crawford, Ruffino and Charles Smith over the next several quarters. For the year-to-date period, organic net sales are up 1% and operating margin has expanded 170 basis points.", "Excluding the impact of the Canadian wine business divestiture, net sales are up 4% and operating income grew 5% for the first 9 months of fiscal '18. For fiscal '18, when excluding Canadian wine business divestiture, we expect net sales and operating income growth rates to be at the low end of our targeted 4% to 6% and 5% to 7% ranges, respectively, for the reasons Rob mentioned. As a reminder, as part of our premiumization efforts, we've been rationalizing lower-margin value brand SKUs. These actions are expected to impact wine and spirits revenue growth by almost 100 basis points for fiscal '18 while improving operating margin and ROIC.", "Interest expense increased 5% primarily due to higher average debt balances. We also continue to benefit from our investment-grade status. In October, to improve short-term borrowing costs, we implemented a commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of up to $1 billion of commercial paper. In November, we issued $2 billion of senior notes at attractive fixed rates and used the proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under our variable-rate European term A loan facility.", "Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio moved down to 3.4x at the end of November from 3.7x at the end of fiscal '17 while we invested in our Mexican operation, our portfolio and Canopy Growth and returned cash to shareholders with $301 million worth of dividends paid and $239 million of stock repurchases during the first nine months of the year. The stock repurchases represent a little over 1.1 million shares at an average price of $213 with most of this activity occurring during the third quarter. At the end of Q3, there was $308 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization.", "As Rob mentioned, we're pleased that our Board of Directors authorized an additional $3 billion for share repurchases, which we expect to utilize over the next several years. Our significant capital allocation flexibility allows us to continue to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders while remaining committed to our 3.5x leverage target. Our comparable basis effective tax rate came in at 18.9% versus 16.4% last year. This increase reflects the overlap from recording the year-to-date impact of our election of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings under APB 23 in the third quarter of fiscal '17, partially offset by the fiscal '18 adoption of ASU 2016-09, which requires excess tax benefits from stock-based payment award activity to be recognized in the income statement.", "We now expect the fiscal '18 effective tax rate to approximate 20% versus our previous guidance of 21%. The lower projected rate is primarily due to an increased benefit from lower taxes on foreign earnings. As noted earlier, our updated guidance doesn't include any impact from tax reform. I'd also like to note for fiscal '18, we continue to expect weighted average diluted shares outstanding to approximate 201 million shares and net income attributable to noncontrolling interest to approximate $10 million to $15 million.", "As mentioned earlier, we're now projecting our full year comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $8.40 to $8.50. The midpoint of this guidance has us targeting 25% year-over-year growth. Our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release.", "I'd like to highlight two significant comparable adjustments that occurred in Q3. The first is the $217 million pretax gain from the change in fair value of the Canopy investment and Canopy warrants. This gain is primarily based upon a CAD 18.43 share price for Canopy at the end of our third quarter as compared to a CAD 12.98 share price at the time of our initial investment. The Canopy share price has moved significantly higher since the end of the third quarter as well.", "Going forward on a quarterly basis, we will continue to record a comparable adjustment for the change in fair value of this investment and warrants and update reported EPS guidance accordingly. Our current reported guidance assumes that the Canopy share price at the end of our fourth quarter will equal the share price at the end of our third quarter. The second is related to glass sourcing initiative highlighted by Rob, where we reached an agreement with Owens-Illinois to restructure supply contracts and expand our joint venture agreements for the operation of the Nava glass plant by 10 years to 2034. The expanded relationship provides for a fifth furnace to be added at an estimated cost of $140 million. This will be financed by equal contributions from both partners and will be included in Constellation's future capital investment plans. The fifth furnace is targeted to come online at the end of calendar 2019.", "During Q3, we recorded a $59 million pretax charge associated with the restructuring of our agreement with OI. This initiative will result in more glass being efficiently provided to the Nava Brewery from our lowest-cost source of glass supply, providing Constellation additional opportunities for margin enhancement and a higher return on our investment.", "Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the first nine months of FY '18, we generated $763 million of free cash flow versus $824 million for the same period last year as operating cash flow growth was more than offset by an increase in CapEx. We continue to expect fiscal '18 free cash flow to be in the range of $725 million to $825 million. Our free cash flow guidance reflects operating cash flow in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion and CapEx of $1.175 billion to $1.275 billion including approximately $1 billion of CapEx targeted for our Mexican beer operations.", "At this point, I'd like to highlight ASU 2014-09, the new revenue recognition accounting standard, which will be effective for Constellation at the beginning of fiscal '19. Upon adoption, certain sales incentives will be recognized earlier than they are currently, and we'll make an adjustment to increase accrued expenses with an offset to retained earnings as of the end of fiscal '16. We will recast the full year of fiscal '17 and fiscal '18 along with fiscal '18 quarters. We're in the process of quantifying the changes, but we don't expect there to be a material impact to net sales. We expect to provide recast information when we file our fiscal '18 10-K.", "In closing, we're well positioned to deliver another year of top-tier financial performance as we close out fiscal '18, and we're excited about our financial prospects heading into fiscal '19.", "And with that, Rob and I are happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.", "Dara Mohsenian", "My question is on the beer division. First, David, you mentioned a number of reasons behind the expected large year-over-year decline in beer operating margins in Q4. Are those more discrete factors in Q4 causing the year-over-year compression? Are you comfortable those factors don't linger and you get back to expansion beyond Q4? And then also on the top line front in beer, can you help frame the magnitude of contribution you expect from Premier next fiscal year based on what you're seeing in test markets so far and in light of the heavy investment of more than $35 million that you mentioned earlier in the call?", "David Klein", "Yes. Dara, so in terms of Q4 margins for beer, the real issue for us is that we haven't seen a full seasonality picture of our business really until this year because of being under the interim supply agreement prior to this. And so in Q4, it's our lowest net sales quarter of the year, so we get a bit of a delevering effect at the fixed cost line in the plant as well as on the SG&A line. And then on top of that, we're bringing in employees. So we're adding headcount in Q4 that we will be able to deploy when we get into the peak production season, and we have some line commissioning cost. So I think there's just a bit of a seasonality built in, but we're pretty confident in the margins and being able to deliver strong margins going forward.", "I'd also say, Dara, that we had concerns both for Q3 and Q4 about some headwinds from FX within our beer margins, but with the peso sitting around 19, we're just not seeing those headwinds this year. And then from a top line perspective, we expect the majority of the benefit from the Premier launch will be seen in Q1 of next year versus Q4 of this year, and so we simply expect to have our distributor inventory kind of at our normal 30-ish days at the end of the quarter when we get to the end of the fiscal year, which is why we expect our net sales to be in that 9% to 11% range for the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.", "Sunil Modi", "Just as we kind of approach the February shelf set -- resets and obviously you're launching some new products into the marketplace, I'm just curious on what the retailers and distributors are saying in terms of incremental space because I know that's been a big initiative that you guys have been pushing for a number of years now. Can you just provide some context on kind of how it looks now and how it's changed from where you were a year ago?", "Robert Sands", "Yes. So I think that in general, we're making good progress on our efforts to increase our space commensurate with how we're growing at retail and our contribution from a profitability point of view at retail. So we continue to see good distribution growth. And so I'd say, everything is on track. We've also made some significant organizational additions to bolster our category management activities and have brought in some really great people to continue to drive those efforts. So in general, we're pleased with the progress that we're making. But we start from a position, as I've stated a number of times, of not being where we think we should be or would like to be from a space allocation point of view at retail.", "David Klein", "Nik, I'd also add that on a year-to-date basis, our effective points of distribution are up double digits, so we continue to do really well in gaining distribution.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.", "Vivien Azer", "So I was hoping to get your thoughts on the outlook for the beer category. The results from a category perspective despite your very good depletion growth continue to look increasingly sluggish in Nielsen. That's also mirrored in the deceleration we're seeing in PCE growth. And so with your largest market, California, transitioning to legal cannabis, how are you thinking about the overall beer category for calendar '18 and any impact from cannabis?", "Robert Sands", "Yes. So number one, I think that we think that the beer category is fundamentally going to continue to perform as the beer category in general has been performing. It's a flat to slightly down volumetrically market with all of the growth in the market being in the high end and then the premium end, in particular, giving up shares. So I don't think we'd see anything different there as we move into calendar year 2018 or our next fiscal. And then on cannabis in California, we don't really expect to see any impact from that. I think that one of the things that people don't necessarily appreciate is that cannabis has been generally available as medical marijuana and pretty accessible to almost everybody for 16 years. And therefore, the, I'd say, official legalization on a state level of it for recreational purposes is probably a nonevent is the truth of the matter.", "And then also, as we track what everybody else is tracking and we look at the numbers, we really can't see any real impact in terms of how it's affecting beverage alcohol in general even in the states -- or now six states, including California where it's been legalized. So as, I guess, I've said in the past, it's probably not worth getting into a big debate right now about whether it's cannibalistic or complementary. There's just not enough information, I think, to really say how that's going to affect beverage alcohol in general going forward. What we do know is it's going to be a big market, however, worldwide.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI.", "Robert Ottenstein", "Just following on the last question. I'm wondering if you could give us any details or further details on your plans in Canada in terms of building out a sales team there, the sort of products you will be looking to develop or codevelop and kind of the general strategy. And I understand this is very early days and it's still very much a learning process, but would just love to get a sense of how you're thinking about it and what sort of investments on the ground that you'd be looking to put in place and thoughts on route-to-market.", "Robert Sands", "Yes. So we are making investments. We have started building an organization in Canada. I'd characterize it more as a marketing organization than a sales organization because our partner, Canopy, has a sales organization and will continue to build their sales organization as well, and we expect to partner with them. But we have put a team in place to work with Canopy generally in evolving a lot of what they do in terms of consumer research, marketing, a lot of the standard sort of CPG stuff that we have a fairly deep knowledge and expertise in. And they, as a newer company, really focused on a totally emerging category and anticipated extremely high growth, haven't become fully developed in yet. So we've got our team working with their team, and we expect to attack that market together really when, in our case, beverages become legal, which is either going to be with the initial recreational legalization in 2018 or in 2019. I think the sort of the -- right now, the official government stance is that edibles will come in 2019, but it's kind of unclear whether they're lumping beverages into that or what they might do in 2018.", "So the best guess we have right now or the official word is probably beverages in 2019. And then in terms of what we're developing with Canopy, it is, as it relates to Constellation, beverages, nonalcoholic beverages which would include cannabis, so -- or be infused with cannabis. So we're working on the development of those products and things like branding, et cetera, at this time. But given sort of the time frame, we don't have everything fully baked nor should we or would we at this point in time as to exactly what the product is in terms of flavors, in terms of packaging, in terms of branding. Canopy's got a strong brand of its own even currently, which uses in the medical marijuana side of the business called Tweed, T-W-E-E-D, and I think that brand has a lot of potential as well.", "Robert Ottenstein", "Great. And just following up on that, what sort of organization would you need in Qu\u00e9bec?", "Robert Sands", "Well, we haven't really, I'd say, gotten that far that we're thinking about organizations by province. But as I said, in terms of like a larger sales organization, that will really be done through Canopy as it specifically relates to Canada. So I wouldn't see us building a huge sales organization necessarily, but we will build some significant capabilities and make some investments next year.", "David Klein", "Yes. So Robert, when we provide guidance for the year on our next call, we'll talk about investments in cannabis. But clearly, there will be some.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.", "Bryan Spillane", "Just had a couple of follow-up questions, David, I guess, on the comments on tax. One was just I wanted to clarify the benefit that you're expecting. Is that relative to the fiscal '18 20% rate? Or is it benefit relative to your long-term guidance on tax rate?", "David Klein", "Well, Bryan, what we said in the script was that it would be beneficial to the low to mid-20s kind of long-term guidance rate. But we'll have a lot more specifics when we get to CAGNY because, as you can imagine, it's complicated even to understand what's in the regs as well as working through how to apply it to our business. But I can say that we're pretty confident that it's going to be below the long-term guidance and likely in line with the 20% rate that we threw out for the remainder of this year or for this year.", "Bryan Spillane", "And then do you think that it will have a positive effect on free cash flow? So as you kind of look at cash taxes, cash tax rates, any sense yet as to -- in terms of whether there's a real tangible cash benefit that you'd expect to receive?", "David Klein", "So again, we're still working through this. But before we said -- we provided guidance on an effective tax rate and we said that the cash tax rate would be somewhere around 500 basis points less than that while we're continuing to amortize some of our intellectual property over time. We suspect that, that will actually expand a little bit from 500 basis points, but we haven't -- we don't have final answers. We'll have those in several weeks at CAGNY.", "Bryan Spillane", "But there's a chance that, that relationship between your cash tax rate and your new lower effective tax rate would be maintained?", "David Klein", "Correct.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Financial.", "Mark Swartzberg", "A question on wine and spirits, Rob, but just as a point of information, this group called Smart Approaches to Marijuana points out that alcohol consumption has risen in Colorado post legalization. There's a lot of just really useful data there, I found. But wine and spirits, your year-to-date organic revenue was like plus 1%. Your fiscal '18 through fiscal '20 target is mid-single digits annually, and I hear you on the SKU rationalization. But how are you thinking about what's necessary to deliver that mid-single digits? Or do you think the mid-single digits is too high?", "Robert Sands", "Well, what we expect is mid-single net sales growth for the year. That was our initial guidance range, and we feel pretty confident given sort of where we are right now, and how fourth quarter will go that we will be in that range. Year-to-date, we're about 4% growth on net sales, excluding the impact of Canada, so -- the Canada sales, so we feel pretty good. The market has slowed down a little bit, probably 100 basis points to 200 basis points versus where we thought the market would be for the year. That's probably the biggest factor that's impacting us relative to where we are in our range. We said that we think that we're more towards the low end than the high end of the range. It's probably the market that's impacting that.", "Lower end wines below premium seem to be being impacted, which actually could turn out to be good news. Because I think we continue to see an acceleration of premiumization, and we're seeing all of the growth really in the wine business starts to coalesce around price points which are substantially higher than they have been in the past. It used to be sort of the $8 to $12 range, and now we're seeing very strong growth, which is I'm sure hurting the lower end, between the $15 and $20 price points, which is still well within the commercial segments of the business. And we are particularly well positioned in some of those price points, and we'll continue to focus on those price points. And so over the last several years, we've become much more focused not in so much on that $8 to $12, but now in the $15 to even plus $20 range, where we think all of the growth is going to be in the future.", "We expect the wine category in general, there's a little bit of a slowdown in the second half of this year. As I said, could be a couple of 100 basis points. We think that the category will continue to be one of the faster or fastest-growing consumer products categories, outperforming consumer products in general. Year -- the whole -- the growth rate's been mid-single digits, almost 4%. We were at 4%. So we prefer to be at the high end of the range than the low end of the range, but we don't see anything happening here that is unusual or should constitute any kind of a warning sign. And in fact, as I said, the kind of growth we're seeing at the higher end of the commercial premium range, $15 to $20, I'd say is extremely encouraging for a lot of brands in our portfolio in particular.", "Mark Swartzberg", "I could have been clearer. I was thinking about your fiscal '18 through fiscal '20 objective of mid-single digits. And in the current fiscal year, you're getting about 300 basis points from acquisitions, so the underlying business is doing a 1%. So I was really thinking about, is it just keeping up the pace of acquisitions because, mid-single digits is not how your business is growing on an organic basis?", "Robert Sands", "Yes. I would say that the -- excluding acquisitions, the underlying business has been a bit softer than we'd like to see it. And the numbers that you quoted are essentially correct, but I don't think that we see the short term or the quarter really being indicative of anything. And in fact, it's probably just timing, whether we're talking about the market or whether we're talking about our business overall, which we expect to be in line with those numbers that you quoted, mid-single digits.", "David Klein", "Yes, we don't think we need to continue to add to the portfolio to hit those numbers. We expect that our portfolio can hold or grow share as it stands.", "Mark Swartzberg", "And so do you think you can get margin expansion next year if you want that lift in organic growth?", "Robert Sands", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.", "Eunjoo Hong", "So on the $3 billion share buyback announcement, it's a multiyear program. So it seems to leave you still with plenty of room for additional cash usage, especially with your free cash flow stepping up in fiscal '19 and with some other tax benefits also accruing. So I guess I'm just wondering why the board came up with this number. And to the extent that you don't have a big M&A opportunity, do you think that you can complete the program earlier than you expected? Just kind of thoughts around that program.", "David Klein", "Yes. So Judy, we asked the board for the authorization so that we can be opportunistic, and we didn't want a necessarily a time horizon on it. And so they gave us a multiyear authorization, which is consistent with the way that we've always done it in the past. As we said before, after we've invested in our -- for our expansion needs, in particular in beer, it's our intent to keep the business somewhere in that 3.5x leverage ratio range, and we'll do that through returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and then some M&A activity that's probably looks a lot like the M&A activity we've done over the past few years. So I would say that we were looking for flexibility in the multiyear repurchase and will be opportunistic.", "Eunjoo Hong", "Okay, and then just a quick follow-up on beer depletion. Can you comment at all on the December trend? Just because obviously, last year, we had a pretty weak December, and just wanted to see if you get -- you have any color just in terms of what you saw this December.", "Robert Sands", "You're talking beer, right?", "Eunjoo Hong", "Yes, beer.", "Robert Sands", "Yes, we're expecting a pretty strong fourth quarter on beer depletions is the bottom line.", "David Klein", "And December is performing in line with us getting to that strong quarter, so we're comfortable.", "Robert Sands", "I would say in general, our beer depletions are pretty much right where we expected them to be and right where they should be, sort of around that 10% number. So it's good. It's good. The quarter -- this quarter, it was 9.1%. We're expecting a strong fourth quarter in beer.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.", "Bonnie Herzog", "I just I want to stay on this topic, just in terms of depletions versus shipments. And certainly recognize, there's usually some seasonality, timing differences, but there's still a decent delta between the two during this quarter, and even the last quarter or two. So could you help us better understand the dynamic? And are these two then tracking more closely right now? Or is there still a pretty big delta? And then curious if you could comment on the end or consumer demand, and how you expect this to progress throughout the year given the planned marketing campaigns that you mentioned as well as your new innovation.", "Robert Sands", "So in the quarter, shipments were below depletions quite considerably, I think around 6% versus 9%. That would be entirely a timing-of-shipment matter, and we don't expect that delta to be anything like that as we approach the year-end. Year-to-date ships are up 8.4%, and depletions are up 9.5%. So on the year-to-date, we're seeing it a lot closer. But definitely third quarter, there was a timing-of-shipment matter that -- and I say matter, there's nothing unusual. It's just that shipments lagged a little bit more than usual behind depletions in third quarter, but we don't expect that to be a trend or that there'd be anything -- or that there's anything unusual. I mean, it could be how we ship in the last day. I mean, so it's not -- there's nothing going on there. And then your other question, Bonnie?", "Bonnie Herzog", "Just trying to get a sense of the current consumer demand right now. You have touched on that with the previous question, but I'm more curious how you expect that to progress throughout the year.", "Robert Sands", "If you're talking about [indiscernible] business, we think that it's very strong. And that would be evidenced by the very strong measured consumer takeaway with IRI, for instance, which is -- was more like at 16.5% for the quarter. So we don't see any issue with the consumer whatsoever. In fact, consumer takeaway is very strong right now especially in the measured channels.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research group.", "Timothy Ramey", "I kind of wanted to press on the tax issue, not from the perspective on what it will do to your rate. But particularly in the wine industry, there's a lot of goodies there for the industry. And since many of your competitors or most of your competitors are privately held, do you expect this will sort of fall to the bottom line in perhaps accelerated promotion or maybe leaving prices alone when -- because you'll have a margin benefit? How do you think this will play through the market, is kind of the thrust of my question.", "Robert Sands", "Well, for us, I would say that we would plan on letting sort of the...", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize. There will be a slight delay in today's conference. Please hold. The conference will resume momentarily. [Technical Difficulty].", "Patty Yahn-Urlaub", "We're back online.", "Operator", "Yes, you may resume the call.", "Robert Sands", "I got cut off in mid-sentence, but I was answering Tim's question, and he was asking about the effect of tax reform in general on the industry. And what I was saying was that it was going to be -- we believe it's going to be positive. People are going to have more money in their pocket. And we think that certainly, as it relates to premium products, that's going to be very healthy for the industry. So all good news. No bad news on that front.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Powers of Deutsche Bank.", "Stephen Powers", "David, if I could, I want to come back to -- I think it was Dara's original question on beer margins for Q4 and just reframe it in sequential terms versus Q3. I think your comments on seasonality implies some lessening P&L leverage in Q4. But by my math, your Q4 -- your implied Q4 guidance really doesn't show any falloff in sales versus Q3. So could you just maybe bridge the difference between Q3 and Q4 as you see it? I know you mentioned some hiring ahead of kind of first half '19 demand. But was there anything else going on? Because I guess depreciation comes at -- continues to ramp, so I get that. But on the other side, the peso seems cooperative. Glass benefit should continue to build, I would assume, and so on. So is it really just the incremental hiring that forms the delta between Q3 and Q4? Or is there something else?", "David Klein", "So it's all of the above. So it's incremental depreciation as we bring more assets online. It's continued line commissioning costs, again, as we bring assets online. And remember, once we put something into production, the incremental costs go through the P&L as opposed to getting capitalized. We're hiring employees. I think we have like 100 employees that we're bringing in, production employees in Q4 to be prepared for the ramped up production season. And then there is historically in this year, there is seasonality at the net sales level in the beer business. So again, we're not expecting -- we're not -- I don't want to sit here and really apologize for the margins in the fourth quarter. I'm just suggesting that the margins will be a little bit lighter than they were in say, Q2 when we hit an all-time high. But understanding where we're going to end up with the margins is actually why we took up our guidance in -- or at least tightened the guidance to the top end of the EBIT growth range year-over-year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.", "Andrea Teixeira", "I'd like to follow up on the beer volumes commentary. I just wanted to clarify. Did you mean that the fourth quarter shipment will be more in line with depletions or just for the year as you do the year-to-date? As you correctly pointed out, the difference year-to-date is definitely narrower. But you're talking about fourth quarter coming up to be obviously, catching up with depletions and with shipments against depletions accelerating above shipments, accelerating above depletions to match the year-to-date. And then I'd also would like to follow up on the capital structure. Is your new buyback plan an indication that the uses of capital will be more heavily weighted on towards cash return to shareholders or compared to strategic M&A?", "David Klein", "So on the billings and depletions kind of alignment, first of all, in terms of -- at the end of the year, we'll deplete and ship about the same number of cases. The percentages will be off a little bit just because of the starting point from last year. But we -- I think the best way to do your math is to come back in line with the 9% to 11% net sales growth and the 1% to 2% pricing algorithm, kind of putting you in the very high-single digits in net sales. And again, that's kind of where we are year-to-date on the depletions basis. In terms of capital structure, Andrea, I would say that what the authorization represents is that we're getting closer to the time where we have more and more free cash flow to deploy, and we're saying that we're going to use that in all the ways we have before. But clearly, we're going to buy back a lot of our stock because we continue to believe that the company is undervalued.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of Macquarie.", "Caroline Levy", "My question's around Corona, your flagship brand. If you could talk about what the trends were like in the last quarter, in the third quarter, and how you're thinking about potential cannibalization with Corona Premier or with Familiar on your existing brand. Is that something you're going to be watching very closely, where you don't want to see your flagship Corona dip, even if it is a positive margin trade? So just to talk a little bit about how should we be thinking about that April launch.", "Robert Sands", "Yes. So we think Corona remains healthy, very healthy in fact, given its maturity. It was up about 3% in the quarter.", "David Klein", "Beer [ph] depletions, right?", "Robert Sands", "Yes, on depletions. And that's pretty consistent with where it's tracking, so we see good growth there and good continued growth. Now Corona is the most -- Corona Extra per se is the most mature of the brands in the portfolio. But given its state of maturity and the large market shares it has in particular places, we think it's doing very well, and we think that it will continue to do well. And then you asked about Premier, and I think that your question was on cannibalization. And yes, I mean, we're looking at that. We tested it. The cannibalization was probably less than we thought that it would be in fact, which was encouraging. The cannibalization is not a problem per se because it's not a lower-margin product. But we, nevertheless, wanted everything to be more at -- we want one plus one to add up to three, which is what all indications were in our test market.", "So yes, we'll be looking at the cannibalization, but you can imagine that it's two different consumers to a certain degree, meaning the people that are going to be attracted to a Premier are going to be people who are already drinking some version of a light and low-carbohydrate beer, like a Mich Ultra, okay. And people that are drinking Corona are obviously doing so without regard to it being not a light or low-carbohydrate beer. So just logically, we don't expect there to be a lot of cannibalization there.", "Operator", "Your final question will come from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.", "William Chappell", "I'll try to do two quick ones. One, just follow up on tax. I understand you're still trying to figure out the final benefit. But has there been any discussion from the board of the company of kind of how much of that will be spent back or reinvested? Or how you would spend the extra money in your pocket? And then my other question, just on the business. Any kind of update on on-premise and kind of how that's trending? We heard from different sources that there've been a lot of taps added for craft and all types of brands on-premise. And it seems maybe, you're not getting the volume terms, and so maybe there's some reversal there. So if you could you give us some update there, that would be great.", "David Klein", "So in terms of tax, unlike a lot of companies that had -- that are sitting on piles on cash overseas and they're looking for something to do with it in the next several months, our situation's a little different in that we've already heavily invested the cash that we generated overseas into things like our breweries in Mexico as well as our Canopy investment in Canada. And so for us, I think the cash flow benefits that we think accrue over time get deployed along the lines of the rest of our -- or our previously stated capital allocation strategy, which is continue to invest in the business, return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and occasionally where we can get in a growth accretive and ROIC accretive sort of M&A transaction, we'll look at that as well. So I would say that, that piece doesn't change. And then in terms of on-premise, our beer business continues to do really well, I think for the last -- this quarter, we're up high single digits. I think that's been a consistent trend over the last several quarters. And so we're just seeing continued strong performance of our brands and the brands in the on-premise, even while during the same time, overall trends in the on-premise have been down, call it low single digits.", "Operator", "I'll now return the call to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks.", "Robert Sands", "Okay. Well, thank you, everybody, for joining our call today. We certainly -- we apologize for the line going dead for a few minutes, but we rectified that. I would say that our business has performed exceptionally well for the first nine months of fiscal '18, and we are very confident that we'll continue to sustain our profitable growth by executing on our TBA premiumization strategy.", "Just as a reminder, during our next quarterly call, we will be providing guidance for the upcoming fiscal year. Prior to that, we look forward to seeing many of you at the Beer Industry Summit conference in a couple of weeks and at the CAGNY conference in late February, where we'll be providing updates on our strategic business initiatives.

At this time, all participants have been placed in listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, the call will be open for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]", "I will now turn the call over to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Patty Yahn-Urlaub", "Thanks Maria. Good morning and welcome to Constellation's year end fiscal 2018 conference call. I'm here this morning with Rob Sands, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Klein, our Chief Financial Officer.", "As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at www.cbrands.com. Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call.", "Before turning the call over to Rob, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person which will have us end our call on schedule. Thanks in advance. And now here's Rob.", "Robert Sands", "Thanks Patty. Good morning and welcome to our year end call. Fiscal 2018 marked another year of excellent execution and impressive results for Constellation that generated EPS growth of almost 30%. This is the fifth consecutive year that we've achieved industry-leading EPS growth of more than 20%, an accomplishment of which I am very proud.", "I believe it's worth reviewing some of the key accomplishments that drove this result, as they illustrate our commitment to sustaining profitable growth and building shareholder value. I'll follow that up with a review of our business performance along with some of the great initiatives we have underway for fiscal 2019.", "Throughout the year, we made value-creating portfolio moves that aligned with our premiumization strategy and enabled us to capitalize on U.S. market trends that favor high end beverage alcohol brands. This included our acquisition of Schrader Cellars, a highly rated portfolio of fine wines sourced from Napa Valley, Vineyards that sell for $225 to $250 per bottle to customers on its mailing list as well as Funky Buddha, a regional craft brewer in South Florida, where it is the largest craft brewery by size and volume.", "Each of these additions boast award-winning, high end products and excellent growth prospects. These activities were complemented by Constellation Ventures' investments, including the Real McCoy, a high-end rum, Aging American Oak bourbon barrels as well as Copper & Kings, a high end American-craft brandy that is naturally distilled in copper pot stills and matured in Kentucky bourbon barrels.", "I'm also excited about our investment in Kennedy Growth, the largest publicly traded cannabis supplier in the world and a leader in the medical cannabis market in Canada. This investment provides Constellation with the first mover advantage for a potentially significant, emerging consumer opportunity and aligns with our long-term strategy to identify, meet, and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics, while maintaining focus on our core total beverage alcohol business.", "From an operational perspective, we made planned strategic investments in our beer business and completed the next expansion phases of our Nava and Obregon breweries, which collectively now provide 31.5 million hectoliters of brewing capacity for our fast growing beer business. We also fired up furnace number four at our Nava glass plant, which is already showing excellent performance as we begin to optimize its efficiencies.", "We recently launched our fit for growth initiative, which is a multiyear program designed to prioritize resources across the company in support of our most critical growth opportunities.", "And we promoted Bill Newlands to the position of President and Chief Operating Officer. In this expanded role, Bill has oversight and accountability for all operating aspects of the company. I look forward to working closely with Bill to execute our growth agenda.", "Overall, our strong financial results and record operating cash flow generated in fiscal 2018 created flexibility that enabled value creating investments to support the ongoing growth of our business. And we returned more than $1.4 billion to our shareholders through a combination of significant share repurchases and a sizable dividend increase. Collectively, these accomplishments helped us remain one of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500 Index.", "Let's move now to the excellent business performance that I just mentioned as a critical component to our success. Our beer business continues to be a powerhouse for growth, with its winning streak of 31 quarters of consecutive growth as the number one brewer and seller of imported beers in the U.S. market.", "Constellation also remains the number one high end beer company and growth contributor to the U.S. beer category, outperforming the overall U.S. beer industry and all key competitors.", "As we look back at the past year's accomplishments and ahead to fiscal 2019, let's begin our discussion with Corona Extra and Modelo Especial brand families, which drove strong execution and sales increases throughout the past year.", "Corona Extra achieved record case volumes in fiscal 2018 and has steadily been growing base velocity for five consecutive years. It has gained share every month throughout the past year, and it is the only top five beer brand that is in growth mode. And with Hispanics, Corona Extra continues to have the highest brand awareness, certainly signs of a very, very healthy brand. The Corona brand family closed out fiscal 2018 with strong growth momentum supported by strong TV, video and social media marketing and advertising activities.", "Corona Familiar gained distribution following its regional expansion of 12-bottle packages in the key states and became the number three high end share gainer. And Corona Premier prepared to launch nationwide with the first national Corona line extension in more than 25 years. We are well-positioned in fiscal 2019 with a great lineup of activities to support the growth, momentum of this brand family.", "Corona Extra kicks off a new sponsorship as the official cerveza of the San Francisco Giants and will become the official import beer of this year's Kentucky Derby. English and Spanish language national TV campaigns will be launched to support the brand with this year's increased media investments focused on sports properties.", "New TV ads featuring Corona Extra and Corona Light together will begin running in advance of the Cinco de Mayo holiday and we will begin launching our new TV ad campaigns in support of the Premier and Familiar lunches beginning next month.", "Now moving to Casa Modelo, this trio of brands, which includes Modelo Especial, Negra and Chelada, has been an amazing growth story, quadrupling to more than 110 million cases in 10 years, making this brand family the number one source of growth in the entire U.S. beer category for the past decade.", "In fiscal 2018, Modelo Especial alone achieved the 100 million case milestone and grew depletions 17%. Modelo Especial was the fastest-growing draft in the on-premise channel and the number two share gainer in the off-premise last year. It's now a top five beer brand in 11 major U.S. markets, including New York, D.C., and Denver.", "And even more impressive, Modelo Especial is now the number one beer in the State of California, fueled by its number one position in L.A. and San Francisco. Last year, Modelo Especial had the highest increase in household penetration in the entire U.S. beer category.", "Casa Modelo has plenty of upside from ongoing distribution expansion opportunities in the coming year. Dedicated media spend will increase by more than 20% in fiscal 2019, which will be heavily weighted the high profile programming on ESPN and other entertainment networks as well as live sports property, such as the NFL and the NBA.", "And as of January 1st, Modelo became the official beer for the UFC, the Ultimate Fighting Championship, which is one of the fastest-growing sports in America. Last year, the Modelo Chelada family grew almost 40%, with the launch of Tamarindo Picante, which became the number one single-serve item in the U.S. beer market and propelled the Chelada family to greater than 30% market share of the Chelada category.", "Modelo Chelada Especial was also awarded the prestigious Nielsen's Breakthrough Innovation Award of 2017, a feat that only 18 brands achieved from a pool of more than 4,500 new CPG items.", "As you are aware, the bench strength of our beer portfolio goes deeper than our biggest brands. In fiscal 2018, Pacifico was the second fastest growing major beer brand in the U.S. beer category and a top 15 share gainer and we believe it has the potential to be the next big national brand in our beer business.", "In fiscal 2019, we are executing a national launch of the Pacifico 12-pack can to build on the success of the 24-ounce SKU. The 12-pack can format will be a big part of Pacifico's first ever National Cinco de Mayo retail program and we are launching our first ever national TV campaign and our largest retail programs in the history of this brand.", "As such, you'll see Pacifico on high profile programs, like the Walking Dead as well as NBA, NHL, Major League Baseball, and college football. And Pacifico will, once again, be the official beer sponsor of the Burton U.S. Open of snowboarding as well as the Summer X Games, two of the largest and best known action sport events in this country.", "In addition to Corona Premier and Familiar, I'm also very excited about the new product lineup we've planned for 2019. We are introducing Western Standard, a barrel finished easy drinking lager that will be available in three test markets this summer at a high end price point.", "We are leveraging the equity and authenticity of our high end, small batch, high west whiskey brand and building up trends of craft spirits and barrel-aged beverages, which we're seeing in the wine and spirits space. We believe that this is the trend for the next American beer, sessionability, yet favorable.", "Another segment we are excited about is the ABA space. This is a growing market opportunity, and it's incremental to the beer category. Specta-spiked premium seltzer will be introduced in three flavors and is made from natural ingredients and contains no artificial flavors. At 100 calories, it is targeted as the female consumer, who is looking for better-for-you, right options that fit an attractive and active lifestyle. We plan to begin test marketing this summer. We will also begin test marketing Corona Refresca, a premium spiked refresher in two tropical flavors that are very, very refreshing.", "Our craft and specialty portfolio continues to stabilize. Last fall, we launched Ballast Point, Phantom IPA and recently began a national rollout of Phantom IPA draft. This new brand is already the third-best selling craft brand in our portfolio.", "Now, throughout fiscal 2019, we plan to continue our Ballast Point distributor transition to the Gold Network, drive focus around and across our core brands, deliver innovation and leverage our new tasting rooms to build stronger, local brand presence. Funky Buddha will continue to expand distribution in select new markets and we have a series of new product launches planned throughout the year.", "From a beer operations perspective, I've mentioned earlier that our current Nava and Obregon expansion projects have been completed as planned. As we evaluated our plans for fiscal 2019, including the future growth prospects of our beer portfolio, it became clear that we would need to expand capacity beyond what we have already planned due to the industry-leading growth being generated by the business.", "As such, we plan to increase our Nava footprint to 30 million hectoliters and expand Obregon by an additional 5 million hectoliters, while also continuing the buildout of Mexicali to 5 million hectoliters. Collectively, these projects will provide about 44 million hectoliters of capacity by fiscal 2023.", "We are in the enviable position of being the growth leader in the U.S. beer industry and these investments represent smart usage of our cash. David will discuss the magnitude and timing of these capital investments in just a few minutes.", "Overall, I'm excited about the growth prospects for our beer business in fiscal 2019. As you can see, we have tremendous opportunity to grow the business through enhanced distribution, excellent execution opportunities, and consumer-driven innovation across the portfolio. As a result, we are targeting beer business net sales and operating income growth in the 9% to 11% range in the coming year.", "And now I would like to focus on the operational results for our wine and spirits business, which achieved significant margin improvement for the year, while gaining market share in the U.S. wine category. These results demonstrate that our wine and spirits premiumization strategy is working.", "Our brand investment strategy is driving positive mix and margin enhancement and we are winning in the marketplace as evidenced by our market share gains. These successes combined with our operational initiatives are contributing to operating leverage in the P&L.", "These results were primarily driven by our fast growing; higher margin Focus Brands, which grew depletions almost 7% for the year. Many of these Focus Brands achieved significant milestones and accomplishments last year. Several of our Focus Brands received impact 2017, Hot Brand Awards, including Meiomi, Black Box, Ruffino, Kim Crawford and Nobilo.", "Our products were also called out in the Beverage Information Group 2017 Awards, where five of our brands achieved fast-track status recognizing their impressive growth, including Black Box, Kim Crawford, Meiomi, Nobilo, and the Prisoner. 14 of our brands were named rising stars and seven listed as established growth brands. Casa Noble took top spot multiple tequila categories in cigar and spirits, the best of 2017, while whiskey advocate named High West Campfire, one of the top 20 whiskeys of 2017.", "Now, from an operational perspective, we have improved our cost of goods sold management capabilities. We are using enhanced consumer insights to ensure that we are spending our COGS dollars on product attributes that are valued by consumers. We were also driving asset utilization to improve ROIC by getting the right fruit of the right vineyards for each brand, including international sourcing.", "We have improved yields as a result of process optimization and value engineering throughout the entirety of the production process and we've engaged in packaging simplification and optimized our production footprint. From a strategic perspective in fiscal 2019, we are focused on delivering against select key objectives.", "We will continue to execute a steady evolution to the high end of the U.S. wine and spirits category by capturing growth at higher price points to achieve mix and margin benefits, particularly at the greater than $11 price point at retail. This includes driving growth from our Focus Brands, which grew almost seven times the rate of the entire portfolio last year and represents approximately 70% of the profit of the wine and spirits business.", "We have plans to accelerate our consumer-led innovation and brand-building efforts. As such, we're focusing on capitalizing on hot trend opportunities, like ros\u00e9, creating higher price points with cross category innovation and developing new brands like, DERANGE, which is a red blend that retails for $100 per bottle. It's actually one of my personal new favorites.", "We are excited about the innovation brands we have currently launched and are planning to launch this coming year, including 7 Moons, SVEDKA Blue Raspberry Vodka, Cooper & Thief, especially the Sauvignon Blanc aids in Casa Noble tequila barrels and Black Box spirits, including whiskey, vodka and tequila, will be introduced in a phased rollout beginning this quarter. These collective efforts will be supported by impactful marketing campaigns to strengthen and build new and existing brands.", "We will continue to evolve our three-tiered e-commerce TBA strategy as well as our direct-to-consumer initiative as we clear plans to drive growth from these channels. And we have a long runway to continue to improve our operational capabilities in forecasting, asset utilization, flexibility, and throughput. Overall, we will continue to optimize our route-to-market strategy, revenue management, sales enablement, and operational processes.", "As I mentioned last quarter, while we have seen a slowdown in the U.S. wine industry, it has stabilized and remains healthy overall, with trends that continue to exceed U.S. CPG category growth.", "In addition, our SKU rationalization efforts are creating a headwind as we continue to carefully rationalize a subset of our portfolio of tail brands to simplify and premiumize the overall portfolio.", "Ultimately, we are committed to growing our wine and spirits business -- businesses ahead of the U.S. wine and spirits industry, while targeting margin expansion from ongoing price mix benefits and cost of goods activities.", "In closing, it has certainly been another exciting year at Constellation. Our achievements are many and have driven a year of strong, strong financial, commercial, and operational performance.", "In 2018, we delivered industry-leading market results from our beer business, while continuing to enhance our operational platform in Mexico to support the growth of our iconic Mexican beer brands.", "Within our wine and spirits businesses, we maintained our focus on premiumization, innovation, and brand building, which drove enhanced margins and wine market share gains.", "We are very, very proud to have delivered another rewarding year of value to our shareholders, and I'm pleased that our results can support a significant dividend increase and an enhancement to our dividend payout ratio in the coming year.", "With all of that, I would now like to turn the call over to David, who will review our financial results for fiscal 2018 and provide our outlook for fiscal 2019.", "David Klein", "Thanks Rob and good morning everyone. Fiscal 2018 was another tremendous year, as we continue to generate top tier growth in the CPG space. We generated over $7.5 billion of net sales and 7% organic net sales growth. We expanded operating margins in both businesses and improved our consolidated comparable basis operating margin by 270 basis points.", "We increased comparable basis EBIT by 13%. We increased comparable basis diluted EPS by 29%, which follows the 24% EPS growth we generated in fiscal 2017. And we produced over $1.9 billion of operating cash flow, which is an increase of 14%.", "The strong earnings and operating cash flow growth provided us with significant financial flexibility, as we continue to make capital investments in our Mexican beer operations, return cash to shareholders with more than $1 billion in stock repurchases and $400 million of dividend payments, while making investments in canopy growth and brands like Schrader and Funky Buddha.", "The stock repurchases represent 4.8 million shares at an average price of $216. Approximately, 75% of the repurchases occurred during the fourth quarter, as we believed the benefits of U.S. Tax Reform and our top line growth prospects were not appropriately being appreciated by the market.", "Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio finished at 3.6 times versus 3.7 times at the end of fiscal 2017.", "We expect fiscal 2019 to be another year of strong financial performance as we're targeting healthy net sales, EBIT, comparable basis diluted EPS, and operating cash flow growth. While we continue to invest in our Mexican beer operations, our brands and in other areas in order to capture future growth opportunities. In addition, we're increasing our dividend by more than 40% and our dividend payout ratio to 30%, while we remain committed to our 3.5 times leverage ratio target.", "Let's look at fiscal 2018 performance in more detail where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Starting with beer. Net sales grew 10%, primarily due to volume growth of 9% in favorable pricing. Depletion growth for the year came in at 10%.", "Beer operating margin increased 320 basis points to 39.5%. We're extremely pleased with this operating margin performance, which we believe is best-in-class for North American brewing.", "The margin increase was driven primarily by lower COGS and favorable pricing. The lower COGS reflect strong operational performance, driven by glass and material sourcing benefits, foreign currency favorability, and supply independence from ABI. These benefits were partially offset by a $54 million increase in depreciation expense, which totaled $168 million for fiscal 2018.", "For wine and spirits, excluding the impact of the Canadian wine business divestiture, net sales increased by 5%. This includes 3% organic growth, driven primarily by favorable product mix, partially offset by lower volumes, along with the acquisition benefits from the Charles Smith, High West, and Prisoner brands. Total U.S. depletions grew 1% for the year, while our Focus brand portfolio posted 7% depletion growth.", "Wine and spirits operating margin increased 160 basis points to 27.4%. This improvement primarily reflects mix benefits from the portfolio premiumization efforts, including the Canadian wine business divestiture, partially offset by marketing investments in higher COGS.", "As a reminder, as part of our premiumization efforts, we've been rationalizing lower margin value brand SKUs. These actions impacted wine and spirits revenue growth by almost 100 basis points for fiscal 2018 while improving operating margin and ROIC.", "Interest expense for the year decreased slightly to $332 million as the benefit of lower average interest rates was mostly offset by higher average borrowings. Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the year came in at 19% versus 26.8% last year. This reflects an increased benefit from lower taxes on foreign earnings in the adoption of ASU 2016-09, which requires excess tax benefits from stock-based payment awards to be recognized in the income statement. The fiscal 2018 rate also benefited from the new 21% U.S. federal statutory rate for the last two months of the fiscal year.", "Now, let's review Q4 results. Comparable basis diluted EPS came in at $1.90, up 28%. Beer net sales increased 12%, primarily due to volume growth of 10% in favorable pricing.", "Beer operating margin remains steady at 38%, as pricing, along with operational and foreign currency benefits, were mostly offset by higher SG&A, including increased marketing spend for the quarter.", "Wine and spirits organic net sales increased 8%. This primarily reflects mix benefits, driven largely by strong sales of the Meiomi wine brand, which experienced tight supply in Q4 last year as strong consumer demand outpaced expectations.", "Wine and spirits operating margin increased 80 basis points to 27.4%, as benefits of favorable mix were partially offset by higher COGS in marketing investments. The higher COGS primarily reflect the impact of lower volumes for the quarter and the overlap of certain inventory cost benefits in Q4 of fiscal 2017.", "In Q4, we recognized an additional $236 million pretax gain from the change in fair value of the canopy investment and warrants, bringing the total pretax gain on this investment to $453 million.", "We recorded a net tax benefit of $363 million as a result of U.S. Tax Reform, which is comprised of a benefit from a reduction of our net deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by a one-time transition tax related to unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries.", "And we also wrote down $19 million of bulk inventory -- bulk wine inventory due to smoke damage sustained form the California wildfires. We are pursuing insurance reimbursements for this loss. These items were excluded from our comparable basis financial results.", "Moving to fiscal 2018 free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, we generated $874 million compared to $789 million last year. Operating cash flow totaled $1.9 billion, up 14%, primarily driven by our earnings growth; and CapEx totaled $1.1 billion, which was 17% above last year's spend. The CapEx in below our previous expectations due to timing.", "Moving to our full year fiscal 2019 P&L and free cash flow outlook. For fiscal 2019, we expect to leverage our ongoing portfolio premiumization efforts and execute the marketplace initiatives, outlined by Rob, to deliver another year of strong financial performance as we're projecting our comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $9.40 to $9.70 per share. The midpoint of this guidance has us growing EPS by approximately 10%.", "Our beer business is targeting net sales and operating income growth in the range of 9% to 11%. Our projections include 1% to 2% of anticipated pricing benefit for our Mexican portfolio.", "In fiscal 2019, we expect to see gross margin improvement, primarily from product pricing as benefits from glass sourcing initiatives and operational efficiencies are expected to be offset by increased depreciation. Looking closer at depreciation expense for the beer segment, it totaled $168 million in fiscal 2018. We expect that to increase by approximately 30% in fiscal 2019.", "We expect gross margin benefits to be mostly offset by incremental marketing investments in support of our innovation and other growth initiatives. These investments include $35 million for the national launch of Corona Premier as well as a regional expansion of the 12-ounce format of Corona Familiar. We're also rolling out our first-ever national advertising for Pacifico to drive awareness across the U.S. and supporting other programs like the Modelo Especial UFC sponsorship.", "The additional marketing spend in fiscal 2019 is expected to be weighted towards the first half of the year as we prepare for the upcoming Cinco de Mayo holiday and the summer selling season.", "Beer marketing as a percent of revenue finished fiscal 2018 at approximately 9% and the additional marketing spend that I outlined for fiscal 2019 could move that percentage up by 50 to 100 basis points.", "For the wine and spirits business, for fiscal 2019, we expect net sales and operating income growth of 2% to 4%. For sales, we're targeting low single-digit volume growth and continued mix benefits from our premiumization efforts.", "We expect mixed benefits and COGS productivity enhancements to be mostly offset by some cost increases, including higher grade and transportation cost and technology-focused SG&A investments, which will create operating efficiencies as we go forward.", "I'd like to remind everyone, from a first quarter standpoint, that in Q1 fiscal 2018, wine and spirits EBIT grew 22% and U.S. shipment volumes significantly outpaced depletions. This was driven by replenishment of Meiomi supplier, which was constrained coming out of Q4 fiscal 2017.", "As a result, our Q1 fiscal 2019 wine and spirits EBIT could be down 10% to 15%, with sales down low to mid-single-digits. This first quarter was contemplated when we set our guidance of 2% to 4% growth on the topline and bottom-line in our wine and spirits business.", "Shifting back to the full year fiscal 2019, to be clear, we are planning to expand operating margins in both business segments. However, we expect the deltas between sales and operating income growth to be contained within the range as provided.", "As I mentioned at the recent CAGNY Investor Conference, we've begun a multiyear program to make us fit for growth, whereby we will reengineer our business processes and implement a company-wide ERP platform to create better digital connectivity with our consumers and our customers.", "For fiscal 2019, in our corporate segment, we're planning approximately $20 million of incremental spend related to digital enablement activities, like the ERP platform I just mentioned and e-commerce initiatives as well as investments in personnel and resources to build brands and open new markets in support of our cannabis investment. These initiatives should help us stay ahead of trends to meet the needs of the perpetually evolving consumer.", "Let's transition to our tax rate where we are pleased with the overall net benefit resulting from U.S. Tax Reform, which will primarily be reinvested to support the long-term growth of our business. We expect our tax rate to approximate 19%, which is in line with our new 18% to 20% medium term effective tax rate. As a reminder, we were targeting a low to mid-20% tax rate prior to tax reform.", "While the year-over-year tax rate is expected to be flat, fiscal 2019 reflects the anticipated benefit from the new 21% U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily offset by an increased in our effective rate on foreign earnings, which will occur due to the adoption of ASU 2016-16.", "Under this accounting change, we will record a deferred tax asset at the beginning of fiscal 2019 for the future tax amortization of certain intangible assets. As a result of this amortization, we expect our cash tax rate to run at least 700 basis points lower than our effective tax rate for the foreseeable future.", "For fiscal 2019, our tax payments are also expected to be reduced by prior year refunds. As a result, we expect our fiscal 2019 cash tax rate to be almost 10 percentage points below our effective tax rate.", "Interest expense is expected to be in the range of $355 million to $365 million, and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are targeted at 197 million. For clarity, our guidance assumes no share repurchases during fiscal 2019. I would also note that our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release.", "We expect fiscal 2019 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, which reflects operating cash flow in the range of $2.35 billion to $2.55 billion and CapEx of $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion. This includes approximately $900 million of CapEx for our Mexican beer operation expansion, including investments in Obregon, Mexicali, Nava, and the fifth glass furnace. We expect to finish fiscal 2019 with approximately 34 million hectoliters of brewing capacity.", "At this point, I'd like to highlight ASU 2014-09, the new revenue recognition accounting standard, which was effective for Constellation at the beginning of 2019. Under the new guidance, we'll recognize certain sales incentives earlier than we have historically. This change will shift net sales recognition between our fiscal quarters, but is not expected to have a material impact on full year net sales. We'll recast full year fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018, along with fiscal 2018 quarters and provide this information in connection with our first quarter fiscal 2019 earnings release.", "In closing, we believe we're well-positioned to continue to deliver best-in-class topline growth over the long-term. Our fiscal 2018 results, along with the growth-focused investments we are making while we project strong fiscal performance for FY 2019, demonstrates our commitment to create shareholder value through sustainable and profitable net sales growth.", "And with that, Rob and I are happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions]", "Our first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.", "Dara Mohsenian", "Hey guys. On the beer topline front, your beer portfolio market share accelerated in Q4 within a weaker category. So, any highlights on what drove the market share momentum, and does that give you visibility, as you look at to fiscal 2019 that you can aid your volume goals, even if the industry softens further?", "And also, can you just tease out specifically the net impact you're expecting from innovation on beer volume in fiscal 2019 guidance and a review of how the Familiar expansion and Premier launch are trending in the market so far in March?", "Robert Sands", "Yes, Dara. I'll comment on it all. I mean, first of all, yes, the fundamental answer to your question is yes. I think that our performance in the fourth quarter gives us a significant amount of confidence going into the first quarter and the fiscal year, regardless of what's happening in the beer category in general.", "In fact, I don't really think that the two are connected to the extent that we're looking at the beer category ex-Constellation's beer business. So, I don't think that there's that kind of interaction in that -- the beer category exclusive of Constellation really has much to do with how Constellation's beer brands are performing or will perform in the future.", "So, we feel pretty good about where we're going. And if the beer category softens further, it just probably means that we're going to have larger market share gains as we go into this year.", "And then new products, they are contributing to our growth this year. Our new products are performing, I would say, extremely well. I'm talking about the Premier and Familiar. And when I say performing well, reorder rates are very strong. And by all indications, it's looking like it's going to be an extreme -- they're going to be extremely good introductions and therefore, we're real optimistic. It's probably providing 200 to 300 basis points of our growth in fiscal 2019.", "Dara Mohsenian", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of Macquarie.", "Robert Sands", "Hi Caroline.", "Caroline Levy", "Good morning. Thank you and what a great year. As we move forward, you're adding a lot more capacity than you'd originally planned for very good reasons. Do you think that that's the way this is going to continue, that each year, where initially, we thought there might be a falloff in CapEx in the outer years. If you keep up, a sort of close to double-digit topline growth rate, will you continue to add capacity at a similar rate?", "Robert Sands", "Well, we're planning out quite a number of years. So, I think the answer to your question is no. We're not going to continue to simply add capacity like this every year. But as we get out four, five years, if the growth continued to be, I'd say, outsized, we will have to add capacity at some point in the future. But I think that what we've -- what we're doing now pretty much covers us for a significant period of time. So, I don't think that you should be expecting more capacity projects in the near future.", "I think this takes us up to about 44 million hectoliters of capacity, okay, which should clearly get us to where we need to be through 2023. So, no. We're not going to be adding capacity at this rate in the near future.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.", "Lauren Lieberman", "Good morning.", "Robert Sands", "Good morning.", "Lauren Lieberman", "I was curious if you could talk a little bit more, actually, about fit for growth. So, you mentioned it in the context of ERP systems, but I guess, other investments that are necessary to, kind of, go after the cost savings and any kind of quantification you could give and timeline for what you're expecting to be able to get out of fit for growth, and if that's -- where are those dollars are expected to go?", "And then just one follow-up was Rob, you said 200 to 300 basis points of growth coming from Premium and Familiar. I'm just assuming that's a growth number, that's not net of assumed cannibalization?", "David Klein", "So, I'll take the fit for growth and then also cover up on a -- on the cannibalization point. But -- so from a fit for growth standpoint, Lauren, we're doing this program because we think that there are ways for us to get more efficient as a company over -- by reengineering our business processes.", "We expect that the savings, which at this point, we're not ready to quantify publicly, the savings, we would expect that reinvest in growth initiatives like the initiatives that we talked about this year, like building a better digital connectivity with our consumers, with our customers, with our retailers; investing in creating and marketing brands and capabilities in the cannabis space; as well as looking at different ways to get our products to market from a DTC standpoint.", "These sorts of investments we want to make in our business and we feel that we can mine our current P&L to fund them. And that's really the point of the fit for growth program. We're really in the early stages of scoping out the ERP program and the process redesign work and so you'll hear more about that over the coming months.", "And then in terms of overall growth in the portfolio, I think the way to think about it, there are two ways to look at it, I suppose. One is we expect our base business net sales in beer to grow high single-digits. And so any difference between that base growth and the NPD, so Premier and Familiar is -- so the difference between the growth in our base business and our guidance is explained by Premier and Familiar. And so I would say that the 200 to 300 basis points is probably exclusive of cannibalization.", "Lauren Lieberman", "Okay, great. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.", "Vivien Azer", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Robert Sands", "Hey Viv.", "Vivien Azer", "So, I wanted to double back on the beer category dynamics. Clearly, you guys are floating above the fray in terms of the competitive activity that mainstream price points. But we are hearing from the trade press, about heightened competitively at the high end as well, given some of the capacity issues that are happening in craft. So, a two-part question, please. Number one, I'd love your thoughts on what you're seeing in the craft category. And then number two, how does that inform you're thinking around price realization? Thank you.", "Robert Sands", "So, Vivian, I'd say a couple of things. Number one, I think that unfortunately, we talk about these categories generically and I think that even within these categories, there are subcategories and there's things that are going on that have really no impact whatsoever on other elements of what you're referring to as a category like the high end.", "So, first of all, if you looked at various definitions of the craft category, what you'll see is, on a total category basis that pricing in craft is pretty much consistent with the whole high end or everything else for that matter.", "But within craft, what you have seen is antidotal reports of various craft beer companies reducing prices and introducing cheaper, larger pack sizes, basically to do anything to try to stem their declines. These are specific companies. But it's not really across the whole category affecting pricing in the craft category. That's really more a function of the fragmentation of craft and the competition in craft with the hugely expanding number of craft breweries and the trend towards hyper localization and fragmentation for that matter.", "But in general, craft pricing is pretty stable at about plus 1.5%. Probably, more importantly, the antidotal pricing you're talking about has no -- zero interaction with us. It does not affect us whatsoever.", "If a particular craft brand, because they're falling out of bed drops, they're price to $9.99 or introduces a 15-pack at some cheap price, it matters not to us whatsoever and really doesn't affect the parts of the business that we play in.", "So, most importantly, I guess, to get directly to the point, we don't see anything that's going on across the beer industry or any category for that matter that would cause us to do anything differently than our normal 1% to 2% price increase to cover typical inflation in the business. So, we feel good about that. We don't see anything that's occurring that we think would jeopardize that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.", "Robert Sands", "Hi Bonnie.", "Bonnie Herzog", "Thank you. Hi. So, I was hoping you guys could drill down a little bit more on your Q4 beer margins, which ended up better than, I think, you guys had been expecting, based on some comments you made few months ago. So, just wanted to understand the key drivers of that.", "And then, David, you mentioned you expect beer margin expansion in FY 2019, but your guidance really doesn't call for much. So, you touch on that, please, and the factors you expect that could limit beer margin upside? And then I'd just love some thoughts on long-term expectations for beer margins, what's realistic? Thank you.", "David Klein", "Yes. So, in terms of Q4, the things that were really a little different from may be where we expected it to land was performance in particular continued, really strong operating performance at Obregon from a cost perspective. We also sad some FX benefits that are -- that we got in the fourth quarter, that's may be more of a timing benefit than anything else, because some of the peso strengthening that we were seeing coming into the quarter that we were concerned about actually ended up getting captured in inventory at year-end. So, it's just a timing difference.", "In terms of the margin guidance, we are -- we expect that, depending on upon where you pick net sales number and where you pick your operating margin number in that 9% to 11% range you can see that there's some amount, although, as you say, limited amounts of margin expansion plant in our numbers. But that's inclusive of the investment that we're making in the launch of Premier and Familiar, which, as we said, would take our marketing spend as a percent of net sales up by between 50 and 100 basis points for the fiscal year.", "I would say that over time, Bonnie, I probably would say that we -- we'll continue to drive as much operating margin as we can out of the business. We like the trends we're seeing in the -- in gross margin. We think we can get a little sharper over time from an SG&A standpoint. But we'll continue to invest in our brands from a marketing standpoint. So, I would say that we think that there's some amount of margin expansion to be had over the next couple of years, but I would put it in a reasonably small bucket, as we are really going to try to continue to drive the topline of the business.", "And for me, that's the thing, I think, that's missed a little bit by our story is, the power of the topline growth of our beer business, where last year, we grew 10%. This year, we have a range to grow 9% to 11%. We're setting ourselves up to continue to grow at that rate for the foreseeable future. And so I guess, we would be -- we want to make sure we're appropriately investing in our brands as opposed to just dropping on dollars to the bottom-line.", "Bonnie Herzog", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.", "Andrea Teixeira", "Hi. Thank you for taking my question and congrats. Just wanted to follow-up on your guidance for the funding for growth, if you will, this new program. For the expenditures that you're hoping for this ERP, are they included in your guidance within the range of margins that you have on the ongoing -- on the growing margin guidance?", "And also, if you can comment a little bit on wine. If you, kind of, a normalize after you cycle this impact on the first quarter, what is the kind of growth that you're seeing on depletions? I mean I understand, obviously, the Focus Brands, but if you look at it like excluding these effect, we are looking at, obviously, a much bigger -- if you can do the math, a much better improvement after this effect in the first quarter. Thank you.", "David Klein", "Yes. So, on the fit for growth in ERP question, that's included in our guidance. Again, that's part of why you see costs -- our corporate costs going up. In terms of wine growth, we -- Rob mentioned that we had seen a bit of a slowdown from where we were over, say, the last five to 10 years in the wine business. We saw a bit of a slowdown in calendar year 2017.", "We, however, are also seeing a bit of a bifurcation within the wine business, where -- and Bill talked about this at the CAGNY Conference, where above the -- that $11 price point, which is somewhat arbitrary, but above that $11 price point, we're seeing market growth that are in the range of 13% versus 1% growth rate for the brands below the $11 price point.", "And we believe that you see this capability in our portfolio when you see the growth that we have in our Focus Brands versus the growth in the rest of the market. And so we remain quite bullish on our Focus Brands, while we continue to work the SKU rationalization sorts of activities that we've talked about in the past, which, as Rob mentioned, is creating a drag on the business, so about 100 basis points in FY 2018 and we'll have included in our guidance, some amount of drag, maybe in the 50 basis points range during FY 2019.", "Andrea Teixeira", "Thank you, David. Just a follow-up on FX. What is embedded in your guidance, in terms of, you always hedged part of your COGS? Can you update us on the range of FX that you disclosed before?", "David Klein", "Yes. I think, from an FX standpoint, at this point in the year, we're probably around 60% hedged. Our biggest exposure, as you know, is to the peso, and the peso has been fairly stable recently, although, we expect there could be some volatility in the peso, as we go through the public discussions around NAFTA and the elections in Mexico.", "Andrea Teixeira", "And you're ready to disclose the amounts that you're hedged at or--", "David Klein", "Yes. I just -- again, I think, we're roughly in that 60% hedged range as we go into the year.", "Andrea Teixeira", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Powers of Deutsche Bank.", "Stephen Powers", "Great. Good morning guys.", "Robert Sands", "Good morning.", "Stephen Powers", "I guess just given how important increased distribution is to the beer-growth algorithm, can you talk about your line of sight to incremental points of distribution entering fiscal 2019 across all the brand families inclusive of Premier, Familiar but also, what you expect on Modelo, Pacifico, and craft?", "And I guess, as you think about that, I'm curious about two things. First, what portion of the gains embedded in the outlook you feel at this point is more or less locked in versus what you need to go out incrementally win over the course of the year?", "And then second, just for context, as your conversations with distributors and retailers have taken shape, if there's any way to frame how this year's setup compares to what you might have saw entering fiscal 2018? That'd be great context. Thanks.", "Robert Sands", "So, our line of sight to getting more distribution is very good, in that we have definitive distribution gaps in big -- parts of our portfolio. And therefore, we have a lot of upside, especially when you look at the Modelo Especial family and when you look at brands like Pacifico, there continue to be huge upsize to be gained in distribution, and our organizations are all tasked and incentivized against getting that distribution. So, I'd say, we have very good line of sight into getting the distribution.", "And therefore, it's just another factor that goes into the confidence that we have in the business of continuing along the same lines that it has and in the guidance that we've given. So, there's really no magic to any of that. It's all about sales execution and where we are in terms of what the gaps are, and our people are acutely aware of where the gaps are, and they will be continuing to drive against closing those gaps. So, I'd say, a high line of sight.", "David Klein", "And I would also say, Stephen, that we believe that we've said before 50% of our growth is sourced from distribution. We think that we can continue that for the next several years, meaning that we have, as Rob said, line of sight into distribution opportunities that allow us to continue on that growth trajectory for the next few years.", "Stephen Powers", "Okay, that's great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.", "Robert Sands", "Hi Bryan.", "Bryan Spillane", "Good morning everyone. Just that -- I wanted a follow-up, I guess, on Caroline's question earlier around CapEx. And forgive me if might've missed this. But David, could you just kind of give us some sense of beyond 2019, how CapEx sort of phases with the capacity expansion, and maybe just remind us of, kind of, where you sit now in terms of what maintenance CapEx levels are? And then sort of what the growth CapEx is going to be over the next several years?", "David Klein", "So, Bryan, the way I think about it, and when we get out a couple of years in capital, we're all kind of making the numbers up. But when I think about it, we know that we've committed to -- after FY 2019, capital expenditures in Mexico that are in the $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion range. And we know that that all needs to be completed by FY 2023. That's likely to be front-end loaded in that time period, because we're building out capacity.", "In addition to that, in the rest of our business, just broadly speaking, we spend about $200 million in CapEx, that's the corporate initiatives, wine and spirits. And then just as a placeholder, we've been thinking, its $100 million to $200 million of spend in our beer business from an -- on an ongoing business for maintenance as well as for value engineering and return-generating investments in our production assets outside of simple capacity expansion. So, I think that kind of frames up where we see CapEx beyond FY 2019.", "Bryan Spillane", "So, that would mean, I guess, that like 2020 CapEx might look similar to fiscal 2019, and then it begins to kind of taper from there. Would that be a good way to, kind of, think about modeling it?", "David Klein", "Yes, I think that's fair.", "Bryan Spillane", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research.", "Timothy Ramey", "Thanks so much. Congratulations. I was interested in your comment on the $19 million write-down of smoke damage to bulk wine. Are you seeing that more broadly in the industry? And does that firm up the bulk wine market? Does that wine, that's written down, still exist for the bulk wine market? Or is it essentially condemned?", "Robert Sands", "So, we're -- I'd say, interestingly enough, we're probably the first company to talk about this. I believe that there's probably a significant amount of smoke tainted or damaged bulk wine or wine out there in the tanks and in the valley. I think that it's not something that everybody's necessarily telegraphing.", "I don't know how it's going to affect the bulk wine market other than I don't believe that is -- will have any effect on us, whatsoever. And we're certainly not going to use any of the tainted -- smoke-tainted bulk wine or buy any. And I think that from what I hear, a few others -- some of the most premium guys who are now realizing that there's some smoke-tainted wine out there, I've heard of a couple that are going to skip the vintage. But I don't -- this isn't going to have any impact on us or our ability to meet our guidance.", "Our wine business is very strong. We've got some fantastic brands that are just really blowing the facts off a lot of the industry. Things like Meiomi and Kim Crawford and Prisoner could get some unbelievable innovation out there, like DERANGE, which is our new high-end wine blend out of the Prisoner Wine Company, part of our business.", "We've really been leaders in driving the new, sort of, barrel-aged spirits or Bourbon Barrel-Aged wines with our Robert Mondavi Private Selection, which is in significant growth and Cooper & Thief, which is -- I think, it'll turn out to be a significant phenomenon where we've extended that to tequila, Barrel-Aged Sauvignon Blanc, which I'd say try it. It's very unusual wine.", "So, the smoke taint issue is a small one. We don't expect it to be a recurring matter. It's relatively immaterial to us. And we don't expect it to have any impact on us going forward. But yes, I think that there's some smoke-tainted wine out there in the valley.", "Timothy Ramey", "Actually I was thinking of it from a positive perspective, given that, as you put it, skipping of vintage and making an insurance claim it's one of the best ways to enhance margins and perhaps pricing and [Indiscernible], would you -- do you think that's overstating it?", "Robert Sands", "For some companies, I'd say that, that's possibly the case. We're not going to have to skip our vintage in any of our wines as a consequence of this. But it may be the case with some others, and it could work to their advantage or disadvantage. I'm not actually really sure, one way or the other. So--", "Timothy Ramey", "Thanks Rob.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma of BMO Capital Markets.", "Amit Sharma", "Hi good morning everyone.", "Robert Sands", "Good morning.", "Amit Sharma", "Rob, a quick clarification and then a bigger question on the Premier. The 50 basis point SKU rationalization impact on the wine business in this year, should we assume that's the end of it? And going forward that is no longer a headwind? And then I have a Premier question.", "Robert Sands", "So, no. I'd say that in general, SKU rat is going to be the case. I think it's just generally good business practice to call the portfolio every year of smaller and slow-moving SKUs that are non-strategic to the company. It helps to make sure that, fundamentally, the whole supply chain isn't mucked up and that you're managing the balance sheet, in particular, working capital, efficiently by not -- by getting rid of, as I said, small and slow-moving SKUs that can tend to drive inventories up and basically gum up your operations.", "So, we'll have SKU rat every year, which is a big portfolio like our wine portfolio, would not be unusual at all and it's probably best practice in terms of managing the business and the balance sheet and working capital and efficiencies.", "Amit Sharma", "Got it. And then on Premier, look our conversation with some of the distributors has been really positive. There is clearly a lot of enthusiasm for how the brand has performed initially. Just as you look maybe two, three years down the road, and you think about the targeted audience and segment, I mean, close to 150 million cases segment, what are the realistic scenario for Premier as a percent of share for that segment?", "Robert Sands", "Well, I mean, that's a little bit hard to predict. But I said something a little earlier about not getting too focused on categories and it's really about brands. It's interesting to talk about like the super-premium category doing well, because it's not a category, it's one brand. It's Mich Ultra.", "And then Premier is a new brand or a new sub-brand of Corona, that is designed to appeal to that consumer and has some additional attributes of being more premium than what's out there and successful at the moment. So, we expected -- the introduction's been extremely strong. You've talked to distributors. Distributors are very enthusiastic, retailers are enthusiastic, the consumer seems to like the product. So, we think it's going to be a very highly successful SKU in the Corona brand family. So, we're very optimistic, but I don't think that we can sit here necessarily and predict exactly what share it's going to take of what. As I said, there's no category anyway. It's a brand.", "Amit Sharma", "Got it.", "Robert Sands", "So, we think it's going to compete extremely well against the competition, let's put it that way.", "Amit Sharma", "I understand. Thank you so much.", "Robert Sands", "And it may be by the way that the competition -- hopefully, the competition does well and Premier does well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.", "Freda Zhuo", "Hi, this is actually Freda on for Judy. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on CapEx a little bit and get a sense of what drove the decision-making between expanding incrementally at Obregon versus, maybe, a little bit more Mexicali or building even further with the Nava.", "And then if you look at like the $900 million guide for Obregon, like 5 million hectoliter expansion, it would imply that the cost per hectoliter is maybe a little bit higher versus what we've seen in some of the other CapEx rounds that you've done. So, if you could provide details to what the drivers to the difference may be for this expansion that would be great. Thanks.", "Robert Sands", "I'll let David answer part of the question. But I'd say a couple of things. First of all, with the kind of growth that we are having and that we're now predicting in the short-term, it's basically resulted in our deciding that it's prudent, given the lead-time -- the lead times to put more -- to start putting in place more capacity, okay? Why Obregon? We think that geographic diversification in Mexico is also a good idea. These states Baja California, Sonora, Coahuila all have different politics, and we think it's only prudent to make sure that we have capacity in a number of different places in Mexico rather than overly concentrating our capacity in one particular place, even though we don't see any problem or major problem, let me put it that way, in any one of our geographic locations.", "And then you also have to remember when we're -- when you're talking capacity, capacity is not -- we tend to talk about it in gross terms, right? 44 million hectoliters, which is, I don't know, about 500 million cases. And when I say that you've got to be careful, it's not just sort of the gross -- what we have to have is the capacity to meet our demand in our peak production months. That's how capacity is planned, because it's not even throughout the years. There's certain months leading up into the summer where we have our largest production runs. And therefore, our capacity is determined off of those peak months.", "So, it's just a process of us continuously reviewing where we are against our long, long-term plans, how we're doing in the near future, we -- and what we expect in the near future and what the lead times are in putting in place capacity. And so we make these decisions to stay ahead of the game, because -- and it's actually a fairly easy decision. I think I've said this probably in the past -- and that -- probably the worst thing that we could do is run out of capacity.", "So, if you start from that premise, given the growth in the business and the fact that the immediate-term prospects remain consistent with that, it makes sense to be putting in place this capacity, given the lead times, so that we don't run out of capacity sometime in the future, which, as I said, a whole bunch of perspectives, financially, customer service, that would be the worst thing that we could possibly do. So, it's really not a very hard decision.", "David Klein", "Yes. And then just on the build-out costs. Just to be clear about what we're doing at Obregon is, we're building a brewery that's literally across the road from our brewery. So, it's effectively a Greenfield inclusive of infrastructure, land acquisition costs and so forth. So, from that perspective, it's in line with what we've paid elsewhere.", "Freda Zhuo", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI.", "Robert Ottenstein", "Great. Thank you very much and terrific quarter and year. This, Corona, 6% growth for the family, wondering if you could unpack that a little bit in terms of how much is Corona Extra, how are cans doing, draft? Any sense, so that we can get a better sense of how that number builds up.", "And then looking out on the next 12 months, can you give us your expectations or rank between Pacifico, Premier and Familiar, which -- how those will rank in terms of adding incremental volume to the company? Thank you.", "David Klein", "So, in terms of growth within the family, I think about half of the growth rate came from the base Corona Extra, and that includes all packaged formats, Robert. But then the other half of the growth came from the rest of the family but primarily driven by Familiar, the success of Familiar during the year.", "Robert Ottenstein", "And how was that -- how much growth did cans give?", "David Klein", "I don't have that. We can get that to you, Robert. I don't have that at the -- of the off the top of my head.", "Robert Ottenstein", "Terrific. And I'm hearing great things about Familiar. How would you rank, again, Familiar, Premier, and Pacifico in terms of likely incremental contribution over the next 12 months?", "Robert Sands", "Well, it's a little hard to do, because it's all a little bit different in that -- Premier's sort of a full-blown national rollout. Familiar's more concentrated against the larger Hispanic markets. And Pacifico is really only in the West and has its core business in the -- in Southern California, but is expanding rapidly.", "So, I think it's good to be some and some. I may not -- I guess, I can't tie up at the top of my head exactly what the ranking is going to be other than we expect them all to make a significant contribution to that, roughly, 200 to 300 basis points that we were talking about in NPD.", "So, for the moment and you can talk to Patty or whomever more about this, after we looked at it a little bit more closely, I'd say that they're all making a roughly equivalent contribution to the 200 to 300 basis points.", "Robert Ottenstein", "Okay. And just to be clear, you're including Pacifico in that number as well?", "Robert Sands", "Yes, I'm -- Pacifico -- you know what? Yes, yes. Absolutely, we're -- Pacifico's not a new product introduction. Obviously, we're just dragging that brand. But interestingly enough, right? Victoria is also growing at high double-digits now, right? It isn't one of our focused brands. Meaning, we're not really putting the same effort right now behind Victoria that we are behind Pacifico, because that's really the -- one of the smaller brands that we think is first in line to really start driving to be the next major growth brand.", "But interestingly enough, Victoria's looking particularly strong as well. But Victoria is a little bit more like Familiar, in that it's got its main strength in the really concentrated Hispanic communities with large populations of unacculturated Hispanics, because Victoria is a very large brand in Mexico and very well known in Mexico, but is not very well known in the United States and therefore, to the general market and the more acculturated or longer term Hispanic population. So, that's got a lot of promise too, is all I would tell you.", "Robert Ottenstein", "Great. And on Pacifico, I've noticed, at least in California, that it seems to be priced somewhat less than Corona and Modelo. Is that correct? And do you plan to have, if that is correct, somewhat lower pricing on Pacifico, nationally? Or do you look to line price it?", "Robert Sands", "So, the answer is no. I mean, I don't know exactly what you're seeing. I think in general terms, it's pretty much priced with everything else. So -- and there would be no -- we would not be interested in a strategy to price it below Corona or Modelo Especial. So--", "Robert Ottenstein", "Good to hear.", "Robert Sands", "That's a resounding no.", "Robert Ottenstein", "Okay. It must've been a retailer's decision and--", "Robert Sands", "Yes, that can always happen. We always see antidotes -- retailers control their own pricing. So, if they want to really blow something out, they'll do it. But there's -- I think if you even look at pricing in IRI across the Pacifico versus the other families, you're not going to see anything different. And there's -- as I said, resoundingly no on the streets that there's no strategy to do that.", "Robert Ottenstein", "Right answer. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Will Chappell of SunTrust.", "Robert Sands", "Hi Bill.", "William Chappell", "Good morning. It's Bill. Two quick questions. One, just any thoughts update on aluminum and tariffs? I understand that you're probably largely hedged and it's still a small part of your, kind of, input cost. But any kind of initial thoughts of how it could affect you or the industry?", "And then second, just on a modeling standpoint. On depreciation, I think you said it's up 30% in 2019. Is that straight lined across the year? Or are there any things that come on where it, kind of, build as we go through the year?", "David Klein", "Yes. So, on the depreciation point, yes, it will build a bit as we put assets into service, but the total will be -- it's that 30%. Not dissimilar to year's number. It'll be that $50 some million additional depreciation for the full year, but it'll build over time.", "And from an -- from a tariff perspective, as you mentioned, we have a strong hedging program, and so we're protected from a price standpoint. But even from a specific imposition of the tariff on aluminum, it's going to have a deminimus effect on Constellation. And you've asked about the industry, I can't really comment on that. But it's not really going to have an effect on us as a result of our hedging program and our source of supply.", "William Chappell", "Got it. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Financial.", "Mark Swartzberg", "Great. Hey, good morning guys. And thanks for taking my question. I like that phrase Robs, SKU rat, I haven't heard it, abbreviated that way, and that's my question--", "Robert Sands", "We really usually like to talk about rats on a conference call.", "Mark Swartzberg", "That's fair enough. But you took down your outlook for your wine and spirits business at CAGNY and SKU rat seems to be -- the rat seem to be the factor here. Two questions really. Is that the only factor?", "And then secondly, if you say that you've set the targets back in November of 2016 and then you've decided to be more aggressive with SKU rationalization, what changed? Are you seeing just higher rates of decline in those SKUs that you want to -- reduced? So that -- those two questions.", "David Klein", "Yes, I'll let Rob kind of finish up with the answer. But I'll just start-up, Mark, by saying, we're seeing -- we saw in calendar year 2017, a bit of a slowdown in the overall wine market. We still believe that the wine market is the 4% to 5% grower over time. We just saw a bit of a pullback.", "But we also are seeing this bifurcation in the market where it looks a little bit like beer, where you're seeing the higher end of the market and we -- for CAGNY, arbitrarily drew a line at $11 a bottle of retail.", "We're seeing that part of the market growing at 13% and below that, growing at 1%. And so yes, we're probably being a little more aggressive than we have been in the past to call our portfolio below $11, so that we have capacity to produce the brands like Meiomi and Kim Crawford, and the Prisoner and other brands in our focus portfolio that are growing high margin brands. And so we're making a bit of an ROIC trade-off, that's causing us to have a bit of a drag on the net sales line.", "Robert Sands", "Yes, I don't have anything really to add other than the bifurcation that David is talking about, is becoming more pronounced in that the growth is moving up the chain from a premiumization point of view, meaning the fastest growing categories are higher priced now than they even were a couple of years ago. And the lower end of the market is less healthy, even more so than it was a few years ago.", "Overall, we think the market -- in actuality, that's -- that the positive trend and it's a positive trend for us in particular because I'd say, we predicted this happening. And we've been generally organizing our portfolio and tweaking our portfolio to keep it moving up the price spectrum from an average price point perspective.", "So, I think we're particularly well-positioned at the current time to take advantage of the fact that these higher priced categories are now where the real outsized growth is. And I think a good example of that is a brand like Meiomi, which is a $20 bottle of wine and a very large brand. Much larger than -- five years ago, there was no brand at $20 a bottle that sold anywhere near -- or had the growth of what Meiomi has.", "So, these are very positive trends for us going forward. And it's not -- I don't think that's what one really should be looking at necessarily, is our overall growth rate, because of precisely this fact, there will be continued SKU rat at the lower end. And we will be -- and we will continue to focus more and more on the higher price points. And therefore, as sort of looking at our focus brand portfolio, which constitutes the -- of the large bulk of our sales and profits is really where you should look, because -- and there the growth is extremely healthy.", "I mean, that could be a business all in it of itself, right? A multi-billion dollar business, with growth in high single-digits in consumer products, which -- that would make it probably in the top 10 percentile of all consumer products' companies in terms of growth in CPG. So, that's what I would look at if I were you guys.", "Mark Swartzberg", "Great. Thank you guys.", "Operator", "And that was our final question. I will now turn the floor back over to Rob Sands for any additional or closing remarks.", "Robert Sands", "Well, thank you all very much for the call today, and your great questions. I'd like to reiterate how proud I am of our many achievements in fiscal 2018. And our fiscal 2019 guidance reflects the confidence that we have in our business just to sustain our top-tier CPG growth profile.", "And we look forward to speaking with you in late June, when we report our first quarter results. And until then, of course, we'll be celebrating Cinco de Mayo by ringing the closing bell of the New York Stock Exchange and as always, we hope you choose our fine products to enjoy responsibly as part of your spring celebrations. So, thanks again, everyone and have a great day.", "Operator", "Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call.
