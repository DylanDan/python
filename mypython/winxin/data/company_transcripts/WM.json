Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the express written consent of Waste Management is prohibited.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's CEO, Jim Fish.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Thanks, Ed, and thank you, all, for joining us this morning. 2017 is off to a terrific start. Our strong first quarter results continue to demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy of improving core price, adding profitable volume in a disciplined manner, and controlling costs as we met or exceeded all our internal targets.", "In the first quarter, we saw revenue grow by more than 8%. Operating income grew by 10% and operating EBITDA grew 8%. Our operations produced $0.66 of earnings per share in the first quarter despite a $0.02 impact from executive severance which was an increase of almost 14% when compared to the first quarter of 2016. We've built a strong foundation and have the momentum to continue to generate growth throughout the remainder of 2017.", "In the first quarter, our revenues grew by more than $260 million or 8.3%. Almost all of this increase was organically driven, and our first quarter revenue was the largest organic growth we've generated in over a decade. One of the drivers of our success was the disciplined execution of our pricing programs. In the first quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 5.1% and our yield was 2%.", "Looking at volumes, our traditional solid waste volumes were positive 1.9% in the first quarter. We've been keenly focused on delivering excellent customer service and directing our sales efforts and growth capital on the portions of the U.S. economy that are seeing the strongest economic development. And in the last five quarters, we've seen these efforts result in volume growth that is generating strong incremental earnings and cash flow.", "Jim will discuss our customer service focus in more detail, but we continue to see improvements in our churn which finished the quarter at 8.3%; that's the lowest number we've seen since 2002. In addition to the strong solid waste core price and volume, recycling commodity prices added over a $110 million to our revenue growth in the quarter. This revenue growth was the primary driver of our year-over-year increase in the earnings of our recycling business which contributed about $0.065 of earnings per share to the quarter.", "In the past, we've discussed the volatility that market prices for commodities create in our recycling business, and it appears that 2017 will be an even more volatile year than we anticipated. In the first quarter, we saw recycling commodity prices up almost 70% at our recycling facilities. Yet in the beginning of the second quarter, we've seen those prices drop significantly. Due to this commodity price volatility, we're leaving our guidance for the recycling business unchanged though the bias is to the upside, and that should become clearer after the second quarter. Although this is a line of business that's more difficult to forecast, recycling is a service that our customers want and we remain committed to it. As a result, we will continue to optimize recycling to ensure we generate the returns our shareholders expect whether commodity prices are high or low.", "Now looking at cash flow in the quarter, once again our strong operating EBITDA performance drove our free cash flow. We anticipated that our first quarter cash flow results would be lower than the prior year due to a couple of unusual items that Devina will discuss. But we exceeded our internal expectations and remain confident that we can achieve our full year guidance of between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion.", "Our preference after paying our dividend is still to use free cash flow to acquire accretive businesses at a reasonable purchase price, so we continue to diligently identify attractive acquisition targets. So our strategy continues to deliver value to our shareholders and we will not deviate from improving price, obtaining profitable volumes, and reducing costs through continuous improvement to generate strong cash flow. In addition to the these core fundamentals, we will stay focused on attracting and retaining the best team in the industry, safely providing superior customer service and differentiation through technology.", "When it comes to our employees, we're focused on identifying and developing our future leaders, and since November we've promoted three high-performing key members into open area Vice President roles. You've also heard us talk about technology as a key strategic pillar for our long-term success. We expect to name a Chief Technology Officer this year to lead our talented team as we further develop solutions that enhance the ease of our customer interaction and improve the efficiency of providing that service. This includes rolling out a new wm.com for our customers and using big data across multiple disciplines to improve the business.", "As part of our long-term strategy to grow profitable volumes, we want to be the premier waste service provider for all our customers, large and small. Recently, two very large customers, New York City and the City of Los Angeles, have decided to partner with us to serve significant portions of their city's long-term needs. We're excited to be positioned to dedicate both the human and financial capital required to serve these two cities and we look forward to delivering excellent customer service to them for the next two decades.", "To sum it up, we've set the bar high with our solid first quarter results and we're confident in our ability to deliver strong performance through the remainder of 2017 and beyond. And so we're reaffirming our full year EPS guidance of between $3.14 to $3.18 and our full year free cash flow guidance of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion.", "And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our first quarter operating results in more detail.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Our revenue growth in the first quarter of 2017 reflected the continuation of the strong execution of our price, customer service, and disciplined growth strategies that we saw throughout 2016. Revenues in the quarter were $3.44 billion, an increase of $264 million or 8.3% when compared to the first quarter of 2016. First quarter revenue growth in our collection and disposal business from the combined impact of price and volume was $113 million. First quarter revenues also benefited from higher recycling commodity prices which drove a $111 million increase in recycling revenues. Fuel surcharges and foreign currency fluctuations increased $25 million and acquisitions also increased revenues for the quarter by $12 million.", "Looking at internal revenue growth in the first quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 5.1%, consistent with the fourth quarter of 2016, and yield was 2%. Both total volumes and traditional solid waste volumes improved 1.9%. On a work day adjusted basis, total volumes and traditional solid waste volumes were 1.4%. Our continued focus on customer service is having a positive impact on volumes as we achieved the lowest churn since the third quarter of 2002 at 8.3%, an improvement of 90 basis points from the first quarter of 2016. Our field collection, call centers, sales, and technology teams are aligned around improving service to our customers in a world-class manner and our results demonstrate this alignment. We also saw service increases exceeding service decreases for the 13th consecutive quarter, supporting continued commercial volume growth. Price rollbacks improved 60 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2016 and the combined positive price and positive volume led the total company income from operations growing $50 million, operating income margin expanding 20 basis points to 16.2%, and operating EBITDA growing $66 million.", "Our collection lines of business continued to perform exceptionally well. In the first quarter, commercial core price was 7.9% with volumes up 2.5%; a 50-basis point improvement from the fourth quarter. Industrial core price was 9.7% with volume up 2.7% in the first quarter, up 170 basis points from the growth that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2016.", "In the residential line of business, core price was 2.6%. Residential volumes were down 1.9% in the first quarter but that is a 70-basis point sequential improvement from the fourth quarter of 2016. The combined price and volume increases in our collection line of business led to income from operations growing $29 million and operating EBITDA growing $33 million. In the landfill line of business, total volumes increased 3.7%; MSW volumes grew 6.8%; C&D volume grew 18.9%, and combined special waste and revenue-generating cover volumes grew about 1%. We achieved core price of 2.1% in the landfill line of business.", "As Jim mentioned, our recycling business exceeded our expectations in the first quarter primarily driven by a 70% increase in recycled commodity prices at our recycling facilities. Our recycling operations increased EPS by $0.066 when compared to the first quarter of 2016. Most of the increase in EPS, or $0.055, was driven by improved commodity prices. The remaining $0.011 was due to renegotiating contract terms and improvements in operating cost which directly aligns with our recycling strategy to reduce risk and improve the recycling business model. While these results are higher than we anticipated in the first quarter, in April we have seen export prices decline between $50 per tonne and $75 per tonne depending on the specific commodity. Given this volatility, we will wait until later in the year to provide any full year change to our recycling guidance.", "Moving now to operating expenses. In the first quarter, total operating costs increased $173 million when compared with the first quarter of 2016. The cost increases were largely related to higher recycled commodity rebates to our customers, increased labor costs due to growing volumes, and rising fuel expenses. Fuel negatively impacted our EPS by about $0.02 from the combination of our fuel surcharge not yet catching up with the increased fuel cost and the absence of a CNG fuel tax credit.", "Our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 20 basis points from 62.8% in the first quarter of 2016 to 63% in the first quarter of 2017. The combined cost of recycling rebates and higher fuel expenses increased almost 200 basis points as a percent of revenue. However, through efficiency gains and cost control efforts, we were able to offset 180 basis point of almost 200-basis point increase in the commodity base cost in the quarter. Labor and transfer and disposal cost each improved 50 basis points as a percent of revenue while risk management and subcontractor cost each improved 30 basis points.", "Our employees have done a good job at managing our controllable costs as volumes have increased which is demonstrated by eight consecutive quarters of productivity improvement in our collection lines of business. Overall, we're very pleased with our collection and disposal operations. They continue to contribute to the growth in our operating EBITDA, adding more than $53 million in the first quarter when compared to the first quarter of 2016.", "And I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results.", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter of 2017, as a percent of revenue, SG&A costs were 11.3%; that's a 10-basis point improvement from the first quarter of 2016. On a dollar basis, SG&A costs were $390 million in the first quarter or $28 million higher than in the prior year period. SG&A costs during the quarter included $13 million of executive severance costs, most of which was non-cash. These charges negatively impacted EPS by $0.02 per share and SG&A costs as a percent of revenue by 30 basis points.", "The remaining increase in SG&A dollars during the quarter primarily relates to the timing of incentive compensation accruals which we do not expect to meaningfully impact the comparability of our SG&A costs for the full year. So when we consider these one-time charges and the impact of timing differences, our SG&A costs were essentially flat in dollars, positioning us very well for SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue to approach 10% for the year.", "Turning to cash flow. In the first quarter, cash provided by operating activities was $721 million compared to $732 million in the first quarter of 2016. We saw the business generate operating EBITDA growth of $66 million in the first quarter, and that's an 8% increase compared to the first quarter of 2016. As Jim discussed, this operating EBITDA growth was driven by the performance of our core solid waste operations and complemented by strong recycling commodity prices. Our cash flow from operations also benefited from reduced interest payments as well as our focus on working capital optimization, and we're very pleased to see that we continue to convert more of our revenue dollars into cash. These cash flow benefits were offset by a couple of items.", "As you likely remember, in the first quarter of 2016 we had a $67 million benefit from the termination of a cross-currency hedge. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2017 we saw increased incentive compensation payment related to the strong performance that we achieved in 2016. These two items more than offset the benefit from increased operating EBITDA and were the primary reason for the slight decline in cash provided by operating activities.", "During the first quarter, we spent $332 million on capital expenditures. That's an increase of $15 million from 2016 but in line with our disciplined focus on managing capital expenditures to between 9% and 10% of revenue. Divestiture proceeds weren't significant during the quarter and, combined, we generated $396 million of free cash flow in the first quarter of 2017 which exceeded our expectations. This strong performance puts us well on our way to achieving our free cash flow guidance of between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion for 2017.", "In the first quarter, we paid $194 million in dividends to our shareholders, and at the end of the first quarter our debt to EBITDA ratio measured based on our bank covenants was 2.4. Our weighted average cost of debt for the quarter was about 4.2% and the floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 12% at the end of the quarter.", "Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2017 was approximately 31.7% which is almost 5 percentage points lower than the rate that we used to build our outlook for the year. The difference is due to tax benefits we recognized during the quarter of divesting an exercise of stock-based compensation awards. The inclusion of this tax benefit as a reduction to our reported provision for income taxes is new in 2017, and it's the result of the new accounting standard. We're going to include additional details about the impact of the accounting standard in our Form 10-Q which we plan to file later today.", "These tax benefits are difficult to predict and depend on factors like our stock price and employee exercise activity. And with the senior executive severance impact, predicting this activity is even more difficult. So we chose to exclude the $0.07 per share of tax benefit as adjusted earnings. Adjusting out the impact of this accounting change, our effective tax rate for the quarter would've been 36.8% which is slightly higher than we anticipated. We continue to expect our full year 2017 adjusted tax rate to be about 36.5%.", "So in summary, the strong results of our first quarter reflect the continued execution of our core operating objectives and focus on continuous improvement. The Waste Management team has once again demonstrated our disciplined focus on serving the customer while optimizing our business. 2017 is off to a strong start and we look forward to that continuing throughout the year.", "With that, Dennis, let's open the lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "And your first question will come from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thanks for taking my questions, Jim, Jim, and Devina.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Good morning. Of the $59 million in volume sale growth in the quarter, how do I think about the mix from MSW versus construction and the special waste? I know you gave me percentage changes year-over-year, but I'm curious to understand the trend line like in commercial as there's still this upside from new business formation and then service interval upgrades that's playing out.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. So if you look at the quarterly numbers by line of business and then you look at those waste streams, commercial has \u2013 and I hope I'm answering your question as you're asking it here \u2013 but the commercial continues to be strong, it looks strong even as we head into month of April. And it's been on that kind of continuous improvement track as Jim said for about five quarters. Then when you look at, well, industrial as well, and I would tell you that industrial has been higher than the 2.7% that we finished in the first quarter, but sequentially we were up from a 1% number to a 2.7% number from Q4 to Q1, and that one also continues to look good into April. Part of that is our energy services business, Michael. It looks like it's starting to pick up a little bit. Might have the first quarter of year-over-year improvement in two years in the energy services business by the time we get to the second quarter.", "And then when you look at those waste streams within the landfill business, MSW was strong and it's been strong. MSW volume has been strong and I think our focus is not only on the volume side but also on the price side of MSW. We can talk about that a little bit as well but the only weak waste stream for us, and weak is kind of a comparative term here because it was weak by comparison to other quarters, but still 2.6% on special waste. With that said, the pipeline looks good with special waste. C&D has been incredibly strong. I think that demonstrates the strength of the housing business around the U.S. and Canada, but that's a pretty good, I think, overview of what our volumes look like and the mix of those different waste streams.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. So if I just parse one thing specifically, commercial in particular is one of your best margin businesses. And how would you think about the service interval cycle on a same store basis today...", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. Michael that is \u2013 sorry, go ahead. I'm sorry.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Well, compared to what that looked like, what that same service interval look like before the great recession. So are we back to those levels or...?", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. The right question, Michael. I'll start with container weights in the commercial line of business, and our container weights in Q1 were up at a higher percentage than previous year quarter, more than we've seen in over a decade. Residential line of business as well, container weights are up. I think it signals well for the economy and for our collection business itself. On the roll-off side, the weights were about at the same level of 2016. As I've mentioned earlier, we saw service increases outpace the decreases for the 13th consecutive quarter. It's a really good sign for us.", "We don't measure it versus the great recession, but I would tell you we're in the, I would guess, the middle innings of that growth in the commercial line of business especially we're seeing good opportunity for us. We're really focused on higher margin side of it. We've seen good growth in the national account business. The multi-location, commercial customer, it started in the second half of last year. So you'll see that in the second half of this year anniversary. So we may not be at that 2.5% level but we'll still be positive and making progress.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Switching gears and Jim Fish, you alluded to this. I was going to ask are you seeing any signs of a recovery in the E&P drilling world and I gather you are?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Well we are. I mean, look, it's heaviest and the rebound is heaviest in the Permian Basin where we don't have a presence. But we're encouraged to see that's, in the month of March, first month \u2013 when we look at it on a monthly basis \u2013 the first month that we've seen year-over-year improvement in the Marcellus and the Niobrara in two years. So we think that that portends a pick-up on a quarterly basis when we get to the second quarter. So we're pretty encouraged with the pick-up we're seeing. It's still is more heavily weighted here in West Texas but it's starting to show up in places where we have a presence.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Another gear switch. On the recycling side, one of the things that sometimes I think it's overlooked, you have a pretty big brokerage business which has got a great cash generator in return on capital basis but relatively low margin. So can you frame, of this positive trend in recycling, how much came from the brokerage side so we put in perspective the margin?", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yes, Michael, absolutely. The brokerage side of our recycling business, it's about 41%, 42% of the total volume, and that's relatively flat. I think one year it was 41% and this year, 42%. Last year it was 41%, so we're roughly in the same place as a percentage of the revenue. And you're right, the margin is at mid-single-digit margins, but as you stated it's very \u2013 there's no capital expense involved, so the ROI is really high and it really gives us leverage in the sale of commodities in addition to just providing more value to our customers, more stickiness with customers that have both large commodity volumes and other waste service needs. So we're very pleased with that business but it's relatively flat with prior year on a volume basis.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. But that accounts for, as strong as the whole recycling pie was, why we've got really great free cash flow leverage but not as much margin leverage. We shouldn't get as hung up about the margin, we should be paying attention to free cash.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. We won't get margin leverage there. We pass through a percentage. We make a percentage on those transactions and that will continue. It won't go down or up much at all.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Maybe a couple of basis points, but not much.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "But not enough to move the needle of the whole company and yet still really good business for us when it connects with all of the other lines of business.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Last question. You said in your comments that you exceeded your own internal expectations for free cash flow. I'm curious by how much?", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "Well I would say when we look at free cash flow, really, where we're focusing is the EBITDA growth that we saw, and so EBITDA of 8% in the first quarter exceeded our expectations. But as Jim and Jim have said, we're waiting to see the seasonal uptick with regard to core collection and disposal business and then how recycling commodity prices impact the second quarter before we update our guidance for the full year. So the EBITDA piece of it, as a reminder we expected full year EBITDA growth to be $240 million to $290 million and it's typical for us to see more of that in the second and third quarters than in Q1. And if you use Q1 and extrapolate it, it would imply that we're well on our way to be at the top end of that. But we're waiting to see how the full year or the second quarter unfolds before we give an update on full year guidance.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Perfect. Thanks for taking my question.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "You bet.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.", "Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Thanks for taking my question. Good morning, Jim, Jim, and Devina. So just to dig a little bit more into the recycling. First, we had been hearing about recent volatility in the international market especially following China's crackdown on waste exports. Can you just talk about what you're generally assuming for price trends over the balance of 2017 and how we should think about kind of the sensitivity there? You mentioned you had some bias to the upside for the business?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. First, I would tell you that it's pretty tough to predict commodity prices. We have a hard time predicting 30 days out, let alone eight or nine months out. But we did build into our guidance $0.03 of improvement in the recycling business. We kind of use the rule and it still holds that for every $10 move it's worth about $0.04, so that would tell you that we built about $7 or $8 of improvement in for the year. Obviously, it was better than that in the first quarter. But then when we look at the second quarter with the real volatility, OCC down 10%, ONP down 40% in one week's time, it kind of reminds us that don't get too giddy about the commodity prices because they can come back pretty quickly.", "Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Yeah, yeah. And then switching gears. You mentioned that you're going to be hiring a Chief Technology Officer. You talked a little bit about the new wm.com and trying to position closer to customers. I wonder where do you see sort of the low-hanging fruit at this point certainly as we watch technology diffusion across the industry? I mean, you guys have been doing route optimization and other innovative data management techniques for many years now. So where do you kind of see the incremental improvements at this point? Where do you see the possibilities there?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Right. No, it's a good question though, and technologies is a big umbrella. I mean, there's a lot underneath the umbrella. There's data, there's equipment, there's customer-facing solutions, Internet of Things. I think to answer your question, you're right. We've put a lot of effort into the on-board computers and then the resulting efficiency improvement that we see out of those. But you'll start to see us using big data in a much more sophisticated way. We're already starting that with our pricing. But you'll also see it with things like predictive maintenance as we look at how do we predict, and we've just started down that path, but how do we predict when things like hydraulics on vehicles will give. And then as opposed to waiting and handling our maintenance in a reactive manner, we handle it more proactively and that is much more cost-effective for us.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Jim, that predictive modeling begins to pay off and we absolutely see signs of that and have real test underway with real application. It'll affect, to your question though, it'll affect not just the operating cost side of the house but service to customers...", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "For sure.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "...as we keep more trucks out on the route...", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "That's right.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "...and improve that consistency of delivery and not have as many road calls, for example, on the cost side of the house. So it'll affect both the operating costs \u2013 it has affected operating costs \u2013 and the service to our customers as well.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Now, if you can imagine though our truck that goes down on the road unexpectedly with a hydraulic hose going out, we're probably paying overtime there to the driver, we've got to pay a towing charge, we may have some type of clean-up charge and, to Jim's point, we have a customer service interruption. So if we can do this predictably then all of that goes away and it's better for our bottom line and better for our customers.", "Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Great. And if I could just sneak in one more. Are you still confident in getting to that 50-plus bps of operating EBITDA margin expansion year-over-year? It seems, just going back to your SG&A comments, that you don't need to squeeze much juice on the operating expense side to get there despite some of the fuel headwinds. But just want to make sure that that kind of modeling assumption for the year is still holding.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Definitely. I think we guided a 50 to 100 basis points of improvements in margins there and we're still comfortable at that range. And to your point on SG&A, as Devina mentioned we said we'd like to approach 10% and we still feel like we have a shot at that.", "Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Okay, great. Thank you so much for taking my questions.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "You bet.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Hey, guys.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Hey, Andrew.", "Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Can you talk a little bit about your fuel expense? You guys had the surcharge and the catch-up in the quarter. Tax credit went away. How do we think about this going forward in terms of modeling fuel?", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "So our fuel costs were up a total of $32 million in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, and that's a combination of our direct costs, our fuel surcharges that we pay to our subcontractors, and then also the fuel tax credit going away. And the increase in revenue that we saw in the fuel surcharge side was only $20 million, so that $12 million delta is what's driving that $0.02 impact. When we look at the full year, what we've seen with diesel cost prices leveling out, if our expectation is that those level out then we think about $0.01 of the headwind in Q1, we should get back over the remainder of the year as the lag in the fuel surcharge part of the revenue equation hedges up.", "The piece that we can't provide any clarity on whether or not we'll get back is the extension of the fuel tax credit and with tax reform and it's kind of infancy from a conversation perspective. It's too early for us to say whether or not we'll get that back. And so the $0.01 that we saw in headwind for that in the first quarter, you could extrapolate to the remainder of the year of having up to a $0.04 impact for the full year.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. Andrew, if you look at the tax credit itself, the expectation from our contacts in DC, if the comprehensive tax reform happens we don't think we'll see that fuel tax credit. It'll be bundled in with other corporate tax reductions. If that falls apart, then I think you'll see that happen, they'll go ahead and pass those extenders. Who knows what's going to happen in DC today.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "But we'll be happy to give up the fuel tax credit for a term for a rate reduction in corporate tax rates.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "We will be happy.", "Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay. All right, that's helpful. And just switching gears on your volumes. You guys didn't really call out anything pertaining to weather in the quarter. I would've thought that would've helped you. I mean, can you just talk about that? It sounds like it probably got offset with poor weather in other areas.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "You know the weather was good for the first quarter; I would tell you that that's last year though. A part of the reason we didn't say anything is because you can always talk about the weather and we try not to talk about it too much. But last year was really unusually mild. So in an odd sort of way, even though we had a good winter this year, it wasn't as mild as last year. So we had a few shutdowns this year in the Northeast, a couple in the Midwest. I don't recall any shutdowns in the winter of 2016. Whereas last year, we actually did talk about the fact that we were concerned we might've borrowed some volume from Q2 in Q1. I don't think we have that feel and it looks to be the case when we look at our April numbers.", "Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay.", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "The other thing I would say about weather is in California in particular we did have an impact from all of the rain that that region saw. And so we did see a bit of a negative impact on those businesses, but that was isolated and minor to the quarter.", "Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, guys.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.", "Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Good morning. Thank you. The first question is just around customer churn. It's improved obviously over the last couple of years. Could you give us a sense whether 7% is realistic there or whether you have a target there that you think is achievable and where does that come from?", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Hamzah, good to hear from you. 8.3% is a really good number. That's pretty close to what we had targeted for the whole year. But I'll tell you there's still room for improvement and we would never say otherwise. We've been in the upper 7s before but it's been over a decade ago as we began to roll out service machine internal initiative, and we're back in that vicinity now. So we'll continue to seek improvement, we'll look for improvement but upper 7s, lower 8s is a pretty good number given our history and given the opportunity in the marketplace. We think that we'll continue to see small improvements but that are big with regard to the impact on the business from the commercial line of business especially at keeping those high-margin, high-ROI customers.", "Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Got it. And then just on the share buyback. It seems like leverage is low. If you get tax reform, cash flow goes up. You already have cut SG&A over time. What does your M&A pipeline look like and just remind us what verticals you guys consider core?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yes. So good morning, Hamzah. When we think about M&A, we're certainly interested in core acquisitions. And to your question, we would define core as being, of course, core solid waste, industrial, hazardous, potentially energy services, even recycling; all of those, we throw in that core bucket. So anything that would be a good strategic fit for us within those core buckets at a fair price, we would consider and we continue to look for those.", "Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay, got it. Last question and I'll turn it over. You guys mentioned the brokerage volume on recycling. You've also done some contract work around your recycling business. Could you just remind us, is the operating leverage in your recycling business lower than what it's been historically? OCC pricing was up a lot but it seems like the flow through wasn't very high. So just trying to get a sense of is there anything different around the rebate structure, contract structure or anything else versus history?", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. Hamzah, we believe the recycling strategy that we laid out a couple of years ago was to reduce the risk in the Atlanta business, and we've done that through the contract renegotiations and renewals. We now charge a processing fee that we believe provides our shareholders with a reasonable return, accretive return, and yet gives customers what they want. But yet we were not rebating at the same level with floors in place like we had before. You saw that in Q1 our recycling rebates to customers were up but yet our margin was accretive to the company and it was very positive for us. So the whole goal was to reduce the risk and yet still play in that marketplace and provide customers what they expect from us, and we've done that.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "I think, Hamzah, the restructuring of the contracts that you mentioned, you'll see that show up most when we're down at the low end of commodity prices and, to Jim's point, we've derisked the business down there. When you're kind of in the middle or in the upper end where we've been in the last couple of quarters, you don't see the change from the contract restructuring so much when prices are where they are.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "And part of, Hamzah, the continuous improvement for the whole company, we're really focused on the operating side. And if you compare us back today versus two or three years ago, the gross operating expense per tonne is consistently lower quarter-by-quarter. So we're in good shape there, Hamzah, on a long-term basis.", "Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay, great. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi. Good morning, everyone. Congrats to Devina and her move in the interim tech (43:52).", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Making it official. Great. You had really strong volumes again and you'd mentioned some of the regional impacts. But I was wondering if you could maybe just step back and look at the country more broadly and talk about what kind of regional trends you saw and where the strength was a little bit better than average or maybe was held back by some factors?", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Sure, Brian. Particularly as if you look at C&D for example, C&D was very strong in the quarter and has been strong for probably five or six consecutive quarters. Regionally, that's where you would expect to see it. It's in the South, it's in the West. But, really, it's hard to find a place where C&D showed weakness honestly. It wasn't as strong in maybe the Midwest and the upper Midwest as it was in Florida, but I wouldn't characterize it as being weak. So when you look at C&D that, I think, demonstrates that the housing market and maybe the overall economy seem to be somewhat optimistic and on an upswing. And then when you look at our \u2013 we talked about our industrial business or the industrial piece of our business that is related to energy services, that's been starting to show some real signs of recovery as well, and of course those are in those areas of the country where we have energy services operations, specifically Pennsylvania, Colorado, and Texas. It's somewhat limited there. You don't see it in areas where we don't have energy services.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Thanks for that. And recycled commodity prices, particularly recycled fiber, tends to be a little volatile. And I think one of the theories for why it spiked so much over the last couple of months was maybe just a shift in trends from retail, brick-and-mortar to e-commerce and changes that might have on collection patterns. In essence, you guys are a little bit more on the forefront of that. Just wondering if you've seen that and kind of how your recycled fiber volumes have trended over the last couple of months? We know the pricing has been up a lot, but just kind of a look at how the volumes have been.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. I mean, the volumes have been \u2013 I think we're up 1% in volumes for the quarter. Definitely over the long-term, it's going to move or the shift that we're seeing in retail is going to affect volumes. It's hard to see it on a quarter-to-quarter basis though. And when we look at pricing of commodities, the volatility is greatest where the Chinese have the greatest impact. So for us, for example, virtually all of our newsprints goes to China and so when the Chinese decide they're not going to buy newsprints as they did a couple of weeks back, it really dramatically impacts the price of ONP, hence the drop of 40%. We end up selling about maybe 30% of our OCC to China, so while they still have a big and material impact on price that one was only off about 10% a couple of weeks ago. So, really, the pricing is probably driven as much by what the Chinese do and then the volume is much more of a longer-term trend. Somehow to your point, it will be a result of the shift in the retail business.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Thanks. And just one more if I could. You mentioned a little bit about the fuel tax credit as a bit of a headwind. Just wondering, tied to that, if there's any change in some of the energy credits that you get off of the landfills or pricing on some of that that may have changed in the last couple of months?", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "That would affect the tax line and you'll see with the 36.8% that we basically came in right at our guidance. So we've not seen a negative impact on that at this point.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Good morning, Waste Management team.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Good morning Al.", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "I wanted to come back to recycling and the energy piece but I think Jim Trevathan has talked a little earlier about the strategic process or changes you guys have made. It strikes me as, I don't know, just curious I guess that a $10 move now only has $0.04 benefit to you which is similar to others in the industry. I mean, I understand you're trying to do, and properly do, is minimize the risk but why would you give up so much of the upside in a business that your customers are demanding versus you may be necessarily seeing the ROIC for the investments?", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Al, we haven't given up any of the upside with all of our contract renegotiations; we've just minimized the downside risk and that's where, as Jim said earlier, where you'll see that impact. But we've always said for the last handful of years that that $10 price change is about a $0.04 impact to EPS. That's not been changed from previous conversation on these calls or in person. So I think the business is much better set than in the past. For those years like we had, what, it in 2011 and 2012 when commodity prices dramatically went down and we weren't charging for processing to cover our cost, and now we do, we absolutely price all of our contracts to cover the processing cost plus an accretive margin to the company with a really healthy ROI, extremely healthy ROI in fact. But yet, we've reduced that downside risk and yet kept customers engaged by giving them roughly the same upside that they've always had.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "I just remember $175 to $200 of OCC pricing, the numbers were something more like $0.10 to $0.12, and it was clear that the industry, not just Waste Management, but the industry was over-earning at that time. And so to me, we are back not necessarily to those levels but we're up. But it doesn't seem like the flow through particularly in Q1 is where, I guess, maybe a lot of us were thinking it would be, at least in particular this analyst. So, all right.", "Switching gears. The comment on waste diversion technology that you wrote off, could you just talk about, well, obviously it's probably not significant anymore, but what's the nature behind that?", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "Sure. We were in a joint venture to build a gas-to-liquids plant on one of our landfills in Oklahoma, and the focus of that joint venture was to take methane and natural gas and convert it into a higher-value hydrocarbon. And as with many energy-based commodity-driven investments, the financial outlook for those investments has changed as energy prices has been relatively low over the long-term. And as we looked at this project and prospects for building this project further from the one plant in Oklahoma, those became less appealing. And so as a result, we went ahead and impaired that investment to our view of the fair value of the assets that are on our site.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Right. Okay. Thank you for that, Devina. Finally, on the energy side. Historically, I think you've had more traditional landfills taking in waste given the market conditions and the improvement that you've had in the cash flow and the balance sheet and the longer-term opportunity. Should we not see maybe a little more strategic investment there specifically in the disposal capabilities directly related to tailings and energy by-product?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. As to one of the earlier questions, we did mention that when we think about core investments, definitely energy services is one of those. It's not for lack of looking around. We've looked at energy services opportunities, but it's got to be the right strategic fit for us. It's got to be the right place particularly when we think about energy services. It's got to be the right geography for us and it's got to be fairly priced. So it is definitely an area that we are exploring from an M&A standpoint. It just has to be the right strategic fit for us.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Got it. Thanks a lot, Jim.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "You bet.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First question, I just was hoping if we could just dive into a little bit on the incremental margin. So for the last two quarters, it appears there's been some one-time costs in there that may have weighed it down, limiting that margin expansion. I know growth of free cash flow exceeded your internal expectations. I'm just curious how you're thinking about those incrementals. So, like, what is keeping you from getting to the top end of the range of the 50 to 100 bps of expansion in this type of backdrop?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Well, I don't think anything is keeping us from getting there. We still have an expectation that we will get 50 to 100 basis points of margin improvement. I think when you look at the first quarter and you say, well, on the surface it looks like we were flat on our reported numbers, then you have to consider the $0.02 that we had in executive severance that really is a one-time impact to us, and consider the $0.016 for fuel that Devina went through, really, it's about a quarter lag there for us on fuel between when we see the increase in the price of fuel and our fuel surcharge catch-up to that. And so with those two, you're looking at as much as 100-basis point improvement in EBITDA margins if you take those two out, and that doesn't consider the timing difference that she mentioned in her script of incentive comp that amounted to as much as a $0.015. So we think that that 50 to 100 basis points, while it didn't show up in Q1, it really was because of a couple of those either timing-related issues or the one-timer with executive severance.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Jim, I might mention a couple of things that I did earlier in the prepared comments. But if you look at some of the controllable operating expenses, we improved labor 50 basis points; transportation and disposal each 50 basis points; the risk part of our business, 30 basis points improvement; and our subcontractor costs, 30 basis points. So there's real leverage there that offset a couple of those uncontrollables.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. And if you combine that with what we think about SG&A going forward, I think that probably demonstrates why we are still confident in the 50 to 100 basis points.", "Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Perfect. And lastly, I'm just curious how you're viewing your current balance sheet especially in this gradually improving environment. What's the leverage range that you're most comfortable with and do you think to some extent your balance sheet might be like \"too strong\" in this backdrop?", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "With a 2.4 leverage, we're certainly comfortable that the balance sheet is in really good shape for us to think about opportunistic acquisitions as a priority, and that's really how we look at our leverage as optimal. And we're certainly at the low end, but we could see that tick down from here as EBITDA grows and if we don't have strategic M&A that's a good fit for us and at the right price to go execute. And I think what is most important and how we message that is that we really want to be positioned so that we can execute at the right time, at the right price, to contribute to the long-term growth of the organization. And so we're not going to chase the leverage up as EBITDA grows.", "Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. That's fair enough, I guess. When we think about the $100 million to $200 million guidance on the M&A, can you talk about how that's trending and how the pipeline's looking?", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "Sure. We actually meet later today. We meet once a month as a team to look at the pipeline. And I would say the pipeline is strong and we see opportunities across the landscape that Jim was describing. It's interesting to see valuations at this point in the market. And one of the things that we're committed to is being diligent users of our shareholders' capital to be sure that we prudently spend dollars at the right valuations. And so that's really what comes into play when we look at the M&A landscape today.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Just to make sure you're clear on the $100 million to $200 million, those are really tuck-ins. We've had several questions today about what types of businesses we would be interested in and we went through what we consider to be core. When we think about that $100 million to $200 million, those are really typically small tuck-ins pretty much solely in the solid waste space.", "Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Perfect. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Corey Greendale with the First Analysis. Please go ahead.", "Ken C. Wang - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Thanks. This is Ken Wang on for Corey. Just for the first one. Just wondering if you can talk a little bit about any, just for modeling purposes, year-on- year work day discrepancies for each of the remaining quarters in 2017?", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "Sure. So we have an additional work day of 0.7 work days in Q1. We give that back in the third quarter of this year to be flat by the end of September. And then in the fourth quarter we'll actually have a work day difference that goes the other way. So all-in for the full year, we'll have about one less work day.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "And just FYI, that when we think about work days, the extra work day, the 0.7 work days that Devina mentioned, typically work against us because you have the labor cost in most of your lines of business. The only lines of business where it works for you are with landfill tons and roll-off. And when you get that extra work day in the first quarter which are lighter than the other three quarters in terms of roll-off and landfill tons, it does work against you. We think that it could've been as much as $5 million to $6 million of headwind. We haven't talked about that at all in Q1 for us this year. But no reason to talk about it because we get it back and then some at the end of the year, with this year not being in a leap year obviously.", "Ken C. Wang - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Thank you. That's very helpful. And then just going back to the big data remarks that you had earlier. Can you give us a sense of your IT infrastructure specifically given your roll-off strategy. Do you have all the systems in place to pull all of this data together? And if not, can you give us a sense of what type of investment it would require to do so?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. So we acquired a group about four years ago that's strictly an OR group. And that group is the team that's pulling together the example that we went through with predictive maintenance. That's the team that's doing a lot of that predictive maintenance analytics. So we feel that we have absolutely the right group to do that. And they're not just focused by the way on maintenance, that's the group that's been doing all of our automation of routes, they're also doing things like looking at our safety data and taking a predictive approach to that so that we can proactively train. There's a number of things they're focused on, but that all falls under our operations research group.", "Ken C. Wang - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Thank you.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "You bet.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, everyone.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Hey, Joe.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "So maybe just a dovetail into the prior balance sheet question. I think you guys have earmarked about $500 million or so for share buyback in 2017. Any thoughts on the timing on that $500 million or even any plans to do another accelerated buyback?", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "We continue to have that in our plan for the back half of the year because we're wanting to see how that M&A pipeline shapes out. And with regard to how we execute it, we certainly look at ASRs as an efficient way to execute our share buyback. But that $500 million continue to be in our forecasts and right now it's all forecast for the second half of the year.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. And could that theoretically go away based off the size of a deal that you do?", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "Theoretically, yes.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Sure, sure. I mean, I think, Joe, when you look at capital allocation, I mean, first and foremost dividend and what we've said about the dividend is we want to see kind of a confirmation of that higher base of free cash flow that we've talked about over the last couple of quarters in 2017 before we make a decision to do anything with the dividends in early 2018. And then, of course, we've talked on this call a lot about the fact that the leverage ratio continues to go down and that really, as Devina said, is in the hopes that we find a strategic fit for us. But you're right. In theory, depending on the size of that, sure, you could absolutely see share buybacks go away completely for a period of time depending on the size of an acquisition.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "And then switching gears. I know it's obviously not a big line of business for you, but curious if you've noticed any sort of uptick in your hazardous waste business largely from the inflection that we've seen in both industrial production and crude production?", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah, Joe. That business is a really strategic line of business for us because it connects with most of the other lines and we're very pleased with it. We have seen at specific sites some real growth there along the Gulf Coast. The West Coast with all of the rain that Jim mentioned earlier, it slowed down a little bit of the project work that we typically do in that line of business that's on customers or cleanup sites, and that was a little slower in Q1 given the rain and especially in California, Southern Cal, and that one large site for us, Kettleman, has been a real producer for us. It was a little slower in Q1, but in general it's a very well-performing business and we see upside.", "When you look at the commitments to investment from the petrochemical industry along the Gulf Coast, from Texas across to Florida, you see huge dollars planned for the next decade in the petrochemicals side of the house. That bodes well because we're so well-positioned with the Texas business but with that site in Louisiana, with sites in special waste in Louisiana as well along the Gulf Coast and then in the Alabama hazardous site. So we're extremely well-positioned there and expect that business to continue to grow for us.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. I would just, Joe, add to what Jim said there and say that both our hazardous and our non-hazardous special waste were a little slower than we would like. But I think the outlook is pretty strong. Obviously, if some type of infrastructure build could get passed out of Congress, that would be positive for us on both sides of that, both haz and non-haz. So while both hazardous waste and special waste were not weak but not super strong, I think the outlook is where we're encouraged.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Understood. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey, good morning.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Hey, Tyler.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey, I know the call has been long so I've just got one here. So Jim, I know there is a lot to talk about tax reform out there. If we just kind of set that aside for a sec. I think back in 2010, you guys made some investments in low income housing and such. I surmise that was designed to lower the corporate tax rate, but I am curious. One, assuming no reform, when would we expect those credits to sunset, driving a more normalized tax rate? And two, if we do get reformed to a simplified code would that potentially drive an impairment in those investments as I assume you wouldn't be able to take those credits?", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "All very good questions, Tyler. I'll take that. So we expect a sunset of both the low income housing tax credit investment and the alternate fuel tax credit investment that we've made to sunset I think beginning in 2018, 2019, and we can get more details on that. But the normalized tax rate without tax reform wouldn't happen until probably around 2019. And then when we think about whether or not there'll be an impairment associated with any of that, we're still looking into that. But I can tell you that the way that those deals have been structured is in addition to the investment that we have. We also have future cash flow obligations that we kind of account for as debt on our balance sheet. And so we think impairment impacts would be limited because that assets goes away but so does the liability, but it's not expected to be material. And as Jim mentioned earlier, all-in we think that tax reform would be a net benefit to us even with those investments going away.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Sure. Okay. All right. Thank you.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Thanks, Tom.", "Operator", "Your next question is form the line of Barbara Noverini with Morningstar. Please go ahead.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Hey. Thanks. Just a quick one from me. But, Jim, because you've mentioned publicly in the past that there's a lot of interesting recycling technology out there but, of course, many lack scale and given your strong cash flow recently, what's your appetite at this time for either acquiring or investing in any of these technologies kind of as an industry leader maybe to support building that scale? I guess is there anything out there that you may have your eye on that's interesting from a technology perspective?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Hi, Barbara. Yeah, good question. We recently had a leadership strategy meeting, and one of the things we talked about at that meeting was what does the recycle facility of the future look like. So when we think about investing in recycling, I think I would tell you that investing just in the same type of technology that we have today would be less interesting to us than investing in improved technology that helps improve recycling rates for us.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Got it. Thanks.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "You bet.", "Operator", "And at this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "All right. Thank you. So in closing here, we're obviously pleased with the quarter from a financial results perspective but we're pleased with the cultural shifts we're seeing internally at Waste Management because of our focus on our people, our customers, and our technology. And that was best demonstrated I think on the people side with the succession, planning, and the promotion of three high-performing leaders into the AVP roles that I mentioned. Also on the customer service results that Jim Trevathan talked about, this obsession with the customers is something that I think you'll see Waste Management really focus on. And then a lot of conversation this morning around technology, around pricing, and routing and logistics, and the sophistication of data that we're beginning to bring to our business, we think it's the beginning of this path that we're on for cultural change and I think it makes us the right choice when it comes to an employer, as a service provider or a partner or an investment of choice.", "Thanks, everybody, for joining us this morning and we will see you next quarter.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining today's call.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of Waste Management is prohibited.", "Now, I will turn the call over to Waste Management\u2019s President and CEO, David Steiner.", "David Steiner", "Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. We saw strong results in the third quarter that are a continuation of what we saw through the first six months of the year. Yield and cost control programs driving strong improvement in our core business. We saw growth in our income from operations, operating EBITDA and margins in both our traditional Solid Waste business and our overall business.", "In the third quarter we earned $0.72 per share an increase of over 10% when compared to the third quarter of 2013. When we started the year we had high expectations for our performance and through the first nine months we have met all of our expectations. Our employees have executed their business plans exceptionally well this year and we recently took additional steps to align the corporate functions to the needs of the field to further drive performance. ", "This should service-well as we begin to look forward to 2015.", "Jim will discuss the financial benefits of our corporate realignment, but I\u2019d like to touch on the strategic implications. We realized that growth and everything else in our business occurs on the frontlines, with support and oversight from our corporate teams. So our reorganization ensures that our corporate and field teams are aligned and working together and focuses our field and corporate resources to drive performance. Our corporate teams will work with the field to improve operations in our business by targeting volumes that support our yield focus and reducing costs. The corporate and field teams will have joint accountability in achieving these goals. We think of this is an expansion of the 2012 reorganization, where one of the main outcomes was a more direct line of sight from corporate to the field.", "Turning to our Waste Energy business, Jim will give you more detail on the results of operations, but I wanted to give you an update on the sale and use of proceeds. The transaction is progressing as we anticipated. We should receive Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approval and close on the transaction at the end of this year or early in 2015. Regarding the use of proceeds our philosophy has not changed. We would prefer to replace the $220 million of divested operating EBITDA at attractive multiples. As we recently announced, we entered into an agreement to acquire Deffenbaugh Disposal which will enable us to replace a portion of that operating EBITDA. Our agreement limits what we can say now, but once the transaction closes we will provide additional financial details.", "We are certainly excited about the deal because Deffenbaugh is a very well-run company with both collection and disposal assets and with an excellent market position in Kansas City where we currently have virtually no presence. This transaction is subject to Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and is expected to close later this year or in the first quarter of 2015. We\u2019re still looking at other potential targets, but if we do not find assets at reasonable prices, we use the proceeds to repurchase our stock and maintain leverage neutrality. If we do purchase shares, we would likely begin at the end of the first quarter of 2015, after the exploration of our current accelerated share repurchase program.", "Returning to our third quarter results, our yield program continues to be a significant driver of our margin expansion. For the third quarter, our collection and disposal yield was 2.3%, which is the sixth consecutive quarter of yield above 2%. Our core pricing remains solid at 3.8%. When compared to the third quarter of 2013 same-store average rates in the commercial line of business increased 5.2%, industrial increased 4% and we saw a 2.5% increase in our residential line. This has had some effect on volumes particularly with regard to lower margin national accounts and residential contracts, but we continue to see the trade-off as positive as the operating margin in our traditional Solid Waste business was up 60 basis points.", "Volumes in the third quarter were a negative 1.3% which is an improvement of 10 basis points from the second quarter and the third consecutive quarter of sequential improvement. About 100 basis points of the 130 basis points decline came from lost low margin national accounts. In the third quarter, we once again saw positive Landfill and transportation volumes more than offset by declines in the collection lines of business. Despite negative volumes the Company\u2019s income from operations grew more than 3% and our income from operations margin grew 60 basis points. In addition, operating EBITDA increased and operating EBITDA margins increased 30 basis points to 26.6%.", "Our recycling operations also performed better in the quarter despite an average OCC commodity price decline of 17.1%, reflecting our continued focus on enforcement of restrictions on contaminated loads and modifications to customer rebate structures. We\u2019ve seen three successive strong quarters in 2014 and we expect the strength to continue into the fourth quarter and into 2015. We are confident that we can meet or exceed the analyst consensus of $0.60 of adjusted earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter. A $0.60 fourth quarter would lead to full year adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.41, $0.06 above the high-end of our previous range. Cash flow has also been strong through the first three quarters and we expect that we will also exceed the 1.5 billion high-end of our free cash flow guidance. As we did last year, we may look at ways to invest some of this excess cash flow by pulling forward some 2015 spending into 2014.", "In summary, we\u2019re very pleased with the results so far in 2014 and expect that momentum to continue into 2015. We will be judicious with our use of proceeds from our Wheelabrator divestiture as we look to replace $220 million of operating EBITDA using the proceeds to create long-term shareholder value and not merely to create short-term earnings. This will likely have a negative effect on earnings and cash flow in the first half of 2015 as we look to offset the loss of $0.18 of EPS and $120 million in cash flow from the divestiture of Wheelabrator. Given the timing of the transaction, it\u2019s unlikely that we would close on the purchase of new businesses or shares before the end of the first quarter of 2015. So we would not replace the $0.05 of earnings that Wheelabrator produced in the first quarter of 2014. However, with respect to our core Solid Waste operations excluding Wheelabrator, we will continue to drive margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth and we will invest the Wheelabrator proceeds so that we can continue that growth well into the future.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our third quarter results and the reorganization of corporate SG&A in more detail.", "Jim Fish", "", "Thanks David. I\u2019ll start by discussing our SG&A, which improved $3 million to $346 million when compared to the third quarter of 2013. We have a goal to SG&A cost as a percent of revenue being below 10% and for the second consecutive quarter, we achieved this goal. SG&A cost as a percent of revenue were 9.6% in the third quarter. During the quarter we took steps that are intended to better align our corporate leadership staff, cost with the need of the field operations, which resulted in approximately 650 positions being eliminated and a restructuring charge of $0.09 per diluted share in the third quarter. This is a natural progression from the 2012 restructuring of our field organization, which focused on more directly aligning our corporate and field leadership with the elimination of the geographic group functions and empowering our customer facing employees.", "The anticipated saving in excess of $100 million annually from these actions implemented in 2015, but the main reason for this action is to better align and thus strengthen our corporate and field teams to execute our strategy. We will see the full run rate benefit of labor savings, starting in the first quarter of 2015 while the non-labor savings about 20% of the total savings should be realized throughout 2015. We plan to be at the full run rate of our savings as we start 2016.", "Turning to our third quarter results, our revenue declined 0.5% or $19 million to $3.6 billion. The price volume trade-off continues to generate positive results. However, the divestitures of our operations in Puerto Rico and a portion of Eastern Canada and a negative foreign currency translation led to a negative revenue comparison in the third quarter. The divestitures affected revenue by $24 million and the foreign exchange impact on revenue was approximately $12 million.", "We were pleased with the improvement in our major operating cost lines. Operating cost as a percent of revenue improved 40 basis points to 63.8% and approved $26 million in the third quarter despite a negative $5 million impact from the accounting effect of lower 10 year treasury rates on our environmental remediation reserves. The operating cost improvement was primarily driven by improvements in both our Solid Waste and Recycling operations. On the Solid Waste side, we were able to fix labor cost down as our volumes declined. In the Recycling we saw the benefit of continued focus on enforcement restrictions on contaminated loads and modifications to customer rebate structures.", "Turning to cash flow, for the third quarter we generated $418 million of free cash flow which is very strong but down slightly when compared to 2013. The difference was driven by an increase of $58 million in cash taxes due mostly to the exploration of bonus depreciation and the repatriation of earnings from the divestiture of our operations in Puerto Rico. Our capital expenses for the quarter were $307 million, a decrease of $16 million from the third quarter of 2013. We also had $53 million in the divestiture proceeds primarily from the sale of certain assets in our Eastern Canada markets in the quarter. Year-to-date 2014 we\u2019ve generated $1.3 billion in total free cash flow and $1.03 billion excluding divestiture proceeds. This is the highest free cash flow we\u2019ve generated through the first nine months of year since 2007. It puts us on-track to exceed the upper-end of our full year free cash flow forecast goal of between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion.", "Looking at internal revenue growth for the total company, in the third quarter our collection in disposal yield was 2.3% with volumes declining 1.3%. This led total company income from operations growing $20 million, operating income margin expanding 60 basis points, operating EBITDA growing $5 million, and operating EBITDA margin growing 30 basis points. Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefit of the yield volume trade-off. Our commercial yield increased 50 basis points sequentially to 4.7%. Our industrial yield was 3.5% and residential was 1.4%. Overall collection yield was 3.2% with volumes declining 3.6%. The volume change was a 50 basis point improvement from the second quarter and as David mentioned most of our volume loss was related to the low margin, the loss of low margin national account business. This yield and volume led to income from operations growing $3 million and margin expanding 60 basis points. The industrial line of business including Energy Services drove the growth in income from operations.", "In the Landfill line of business, we saw the benefits of both positive volume and positive yield in the third quarter just as we have all year. Total Landfill volumes increased 4.2%. Combined Special Waste and revenue generating cover volumes were positive 4.4%, MSW volumes grew 5.7% and CMB volumes grew 15.3%. MSW yield rose to 1.6%. This led to income from operations growing $16 million which is the sixth consecutive quarter of growth and margins grew 130 basis points. Our Waste Energy operations were essentially flat in the third quarter when compared to the third quarter of 2013. Since we moved the business to asset-held-for-sale status the suspension of the depreciation expense added $0.01 per share. The sale is progressing as we anticipated. We still believe we\u2019re on-track to close the transaction in late fourth quarter, or early first quarter. David already discussed the use of proceeds, but I want to reiterate, that we\u2019ll be disciplined with the use of that cash to create long-term shareholder value.", "Finally looking at our other financial metrics, at the end of the third quarter our weighted average cost of debt was 4.92% and the floating rate portion of our total debt was 16% at the end of the quarter. The effective tax rate was 32.1% compared to 34.3% in the third quarter of 2013. The rate was lower than our expected rate of 35%, due primarily to state audit settlements and adjustments to our accruals and related deferred taxes resulting from the filing of our 2013 returns. This benefited the quarter by approximately $0.03 per diluted share. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 35% for the fourth quarter. The results through the first nine months of the year put us on-track to exceed our full year targets. We are looking forward to the continued improvement in the fourth quarter and throughout 2015 now augmented by our recent corporate actions. And as always I want to thank our employees for their hard work. They\u2019ve made the first nine months of 2014 very successful.", "And with that Rashay let\u2019s open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) And your first question is from line of Corey Greendale with First Analysis.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities", "First of all I appreciate all the detail in the script about the Wheelabrator impact and the timing and the cost savings. My first question, I know it is early to be talking about 2015 but can you just give us some sense of how you're thinking about the price volume environment going into 2015? Do you expect assuming economic conditions remain stable kind of a similar trend in 2015 as we are seeing in 2014?", "David Steiner", "", "Yes, it\u2019s a great question Corey. When we look at 2015 I think everybody recognizes what we have done with our yield program over the years. As I think everybody knows in 2013 we had a very strong incentive plan to drive yield above 2%. In 2015, we are likely to go back to where we were from 2007 to 2010 where we have what we call the pricing gate. So that folks have a substantial portion of their bonus at risk if they don\u2019t get their pricing targets. And there is one think I can tell you is that our pricing target will be over 2% for 2015. With respect to volumes, it\u2019s a little early to call but I would say Corey that the trends, look this is not going to change overnight. I think what you have seen during 2013 is a very slow progression towards that volumes for us I don\u2019t expect that to dramatically change but the signs that we are seeing from a volume point of view are positive than we have seen frankly in the last three years or four years. And so I would expect the volumes to continue to improve but I wouldn\u2019t expect to see them turn positive at least in early 2015.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities", "Okay, and given what you are seeing now in price, you sound relatively -- I know David, knowing you that you are never going to be totally happy with this, but it sounds like you are generally happy with where the yield is. Why you are thinking about putting the pricing gate back in place and what you expect to be different when you do that?", "David Steiner", "", "Yes look, you are absolutely right Corey we can always do better on the other hand as you well know that 2%, 2.3% yield can translate into 8% to 10% price increases across certain customer bases because we have some restricted customers. But look I think everybody knows that the one year in recent memory that we sort of fell off on yield was 2012 and we said that\u2019s not going to happen again. Now we have a lot of confidence in our field managers doing the right thing. And we have a lot of oversight of our field managers to make sure they do the right thing, but I have always been a believer that you need to support those price programs with some type of carrot or stick. In 2012 we didn\u2019t do that we saw what happened. We had a great carrot for the last two years folks are going to do very well by getting their pricing targets. Next year we are going to go back to a little bit more of if you will of a stick. I would say Corey I am not concerned about these folks not getting their core price targets, but having those guardrails in place through the incentive plans supports the program.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities", "And just one more left quickly if you're willing to talk about this. In 2015 with all the moving pieces between Wheelabrator and potentially charges and the cost savings and the bonus depreciation, can you just give us a directional sense of where you expect free cash flow to go in 2015, whether you expect it is going to be up from 2014?", "David Steiner", "", "Yes Corey I guess the way we\u2019d talk about 2015 at this point because you are exactly right, there is so many moving pieces what are we going to do with the divestiture proceeds and when is the divestiture going to close. And so when we look at it we say okay we have got $0.18 of EPS and $120 million of free cash flow that assuming Wheelabrator, would it be gone on January 1st that\u2019s going to be gone in 2015. So what we are doing right now as we are saying let\u2019s make sure we do the right thing with the proceed but then let\u2019s take a real good look at the core Solid Waste business and make sure that what we are doing in the core Solid Waste business is driving that double-digit earnings growth and driving free cash flow growth. So you should absolutely see free cash flow growth in the core Solid Waste business next year. Obviously you would see that much stronger if we saw bonus depreciation for 2015.", "Operator", "", "And your next question from the line of Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities", "I want to focus on the volume topic here. We just posted another 1.3% decline. You have arguably have anniversaried the pricing story. What fundamentally is not going on in the end markets -- in your end markets -- that that volume can't get closer to positive sooner than exiting 2015?", "David Steiner", "", "Yes well, let\u2019s look at the various lines of business. Obviously let\u2019s start at the Landfill. The Landfill volumes have been positive for quite some time and we would expect those to continue to be positive in 2015. Those volumes are highest margin and have a great return on capital so if we\u2019re going to have volumes growing anywhere that\u2019s where we want them going is at the Landfill and we have seen that in the last two years we expect to see that into 2015.", "On the collection side, you have got the Residential line of business which generally is our lowest margin, lowest return on capital and we\u2019ve been pretty judicious in not bidding those residential contracts particularly because they take so much capital, not bidding those residential contracts at a lower margin. So, you\u2019d expect to see volumes down there.", "On the commercial side that\u2019s -- and so my point is that on the residential side, look would we love to have more volumes on the residential side? Yes. Are we going to get more volumes by dropping price and lower margins just to get volumes? Absolutely not, when you look at the industrial side, the industrial side actually started to turn fairly well for us, I would not be surprised to see the industrial volumes turn positive in 2015 and again those are great margin, great return on capital volumes.", "So the only area where I\u2019d say, I\u2019d like to do a little bit better is on the commercial side. As you all know, when you get commercial volumes you can get great incremental margins because of the route density that you create with commercial volumes but again we\u2019re not going to go out and get commercial volumes by giving up price. And so, to see those commercial volumes we\u2019ve seen sequential improvement all year and that\u2019s a good thing to see those commercial volumes turn you\u2019ve got to get sort of sustained housing starts and sustained new business starts.", "We have started to see that in 2013, I\u2019d expect to see that continue in 2015 but again we\u2019re not just going to go out and throw a bunch of sales on the street and drop pricing to get new commercial volumes because if we do that as the largest in the business that\u2019s going to have a dramatic effect on our pricing program it\u2019s what I said in the script. We\u2019re going to go after volumes that don\u2019t have a dramatic effect on our yield program. There is a lot of great volumes we can get at the Landfill and Energy Services on the industrial side that are going to be high margin volumes for us, we don\u2019t need to go after low margin commercial business by dropping price or low margin residential business by dropping price and so we view that price volume trade-off as very positive, we expect to see it continue to improve in 2015 and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive margin expansion for us.", "Jim Fish", "", "Al I might give a little additional color too to what David said about the industrial line of business, that as I mentioned in my script that\u2019s the line of business that shows a lot of the energy services impact, it happens to be one of the few areas in the overall economy where we feel like we have really good long-term visibility even with declining oil prices, we happen to be in our strongest presence in energy services is in basins where the production cost for the E&P companies happens to be the lowest so we\u2019ll be in the last to feel the downturn there. But we like the prospects for energy services, it\u2019s been growing at -- revenue has been growing at about a 20% clip. We are going to be on-track to be 225-250 in revenue this year and we think we can continue to grow that at a fast pace.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities", "", "Thank you for the color, Jim. Is there any additional update on the M&A environment as it relates to that particular secular change?", "David Steiner", "", "Yes, there is always assets for sale because the multiples are fairly high as you know we did a couple of transactions in that field fairly small transactions but that would be, that would absolutely be one of the places where we would look to invest some of the proceeds but again whether it\u2019s energy services or hazardous waste or core solid waste, we\u2019re not going to overpay for the business just to use the proceeds right. The way we look at it AL, is we have got sort of a base case of buy back shares and leverage neutrality that would be slightly accretive with the use of proceeds. If we can do better than that by investing in businesses we\u2019ll absolutely do it but we\u2019re not going to invest in businesses where we have to pay a higher multiple than our own stock I mean the reality is we\u2019ve two choices, buy our company or buy another company and we would never buy another company at a higher multiple than we can buy our company. So, we\u2019re going to be fairly judicious in how we look at these acquisitions and if they occur that\u2019s great, if they don\u2019t occur, we still think we can buy our stock pretty cheap.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities", "Okay, thank you. And then finally if I may, just a follow-up on the pricing story, or the pricing gate, I don't understand maybe if there is a -- it comes across that there is a change in how you're going to approach the market. Maybe that is a misinterpretation or understanding on my part but why are you altering at least the cadence on pricing here, or reinstalling for lack of better word a pricing gate?", "David Steiner", "", "Yes, no offense Al but I think that is a misunderstanding with where we\u2019re going with the pricing program.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities", "That's fair. Clarify it for us, David. Thank you.", "David Steiner", "", "Look, I would say it\u2019s I think everybody on this phone and certainly everybody at Waste Management would say that the pricing programs are my sort of core focus, right and again look, I have total confidence that our field managers are going to do the right thing and I have total confidence that that the staff here at the corporate office are going to ensure they do the right thing but anytime you have something that\u2019s that important like our pricing programs, you have got to have everything in your company directed to making it happen. And so having confidence in the field managers is great but that\u2019s not everything we can do, having confidence at the corporate teams are going to support them is great but that\u2019s not everything we can do. You got to have the compensation programs aligned also. And that\u2019s really what it\u2019s all about, and say look, the yield program is the most important thing that we do at Waste Management. So everything we do from the compensation programs to the oversight to the field managers everything we do is going to be structured to ensure that we drive that yield above CPI and above 2%.", "So it\u2019s really just if you will, an insurance policy to make sure that everybody understands that this is going to be the most important thing that we do. Now having said that we do want to improve our volumes but we don\u2019t want to improve our volumes at the price of reducing our yield focus that\u2019s what happened in 2012. We said look, we want to get volumes, and we went out and got some low margin volumes and some lines of business that affected our yield programs but also got us positive volumes at low margins. We are not going to do that again. Where we\u2019re going to look for volumes our places where we can get good high margin volumes but not have those volumes create a competitive dynamic in our markets such that the market says wow they\u2019re going to lower price in order to get volumes and we think there is plenty of places where we can do that in the manufacturing and industrial sector, in the energy services sector. We can go after good high margin volumes without affecting pricing for example at the commercial line.", "Operator", "", "And your next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten with Macquarie.", "Adam Baumgarten - Macquarie", "Could you just give us an update on the progress of some of the various cost initiatives you have had over the last couple of years? I'm just trying to see going forward how much more we should still expect in cost savings from those programs outside of the $100 million you announced today.", "David Steiner", "", "So a couple of different approaches here, one is operating cost where we felt like we made a lot of improvement on operating cost both on recycling and on core operations and we will continue to work those cost down Jim and Puneet Bhasin and their teams are spending a tremendous amount of time in the field as developing some real efficient operations. And really on the recycling fronts it is no state secrete here that commodity prices have not been good to us over the last two years. So we\u2019ve had to approach it -- I guess the good news is there, that it\u2019s forced us to approach it from a cost standpoint. We\u2019ve done that we saw a bit of improvement year-over-year in Q3 and so once commodity prices do return to a more normalized levels we think we\u2019re in a great position in the recycling line of business.", "SG&A costs, yes, we took about $100 million the long-term run rate will be about $100 million, about 80% of that is labor, 20% non-labor. The labor piece will come out in kind of -- about 10 million of it will come out in Q4 and we\u2019ll be pretty much done with that labor piece in Q1 of 2015. Then the non-labor has a bit longer tail to it but that will all come out by second half -- for the most part it will be all out by the end of Q2 of next year for a total of 100 million impact overall. Is there additional SG&A savings out there, we\u2019re always looking but I think what we\u2019ve done in 2012 predominantly consolidation in the field and then in 2014 with more closely aligning our SG&A to fill our strategy. I think you probably see at this point going forward trying to just hold labor cost flat.", "Jim Trevathan", "", "Jim, I might add for Adam\u2019s benefit. Adam, on the collection side of the business we now are on about 25% of our collection companies that we are certified. They have the technology, the onboard computer in place. They also have the culture and the accountability process and the dollar improvement to their P&L that\u2019s hitting the bottom-line and you saw that in that 60 basis points improvement in operating margin. We\u2019re progressing through the 400 or so collection companies and should complete that effort in next year. So you\u2019ll continue to see that improvement in OpEx as a percentage of net revenue as we rollout not just the technology but the culture of the accountability and get the dollar value out that initiative.", "Adam Baumgarten - Macquarie", "Okay, great. So what kind of run rate are we at for some of the other programs you have announced in the past, such as the routing and logistics and the back-office stuff? Is that sort of what you just spoke about, that that is still a work in progress, or are we at that full run rate?", "Jim Trevathan", "", "Well Adam that\u2019s what I just mentioned, Jim Trevathan again. We are at about a 20%-25% of the 400 collection companies but the others are in the process of implementation. We are not starting them all fresh and new as we finish the one, that process is underway and going on at the other 75%-80% of the location. So it is a process that about a year we think a year or so left in the implementation process.", "Jim Fish", "", "Also on the lines of David\u2019s conversation about bonus and pricing, a big component of our bonus the field\u2019s bonus is tied to a huge component and a half of it is tied to operating cost. So there is certainly carrot out for them if they improve on operating cost we saw as we mentioned the 30 basis point swing this quarter which we were pleased with, but don\u2019t feel like we are done.", "Adam Baumgarten - Macquarie Research", "Okay, great. Thanks. And then just on the acquisition side, have you seen seller expectations on the solid waste side come down at all over the last few months or so, or is it still pretty high?", "David Steiner", "", "Yes I would say that you really haven\u2019t seen it comedown. But again look I feel about that sort of how I feel about the economy nothing we can do about it but we are going to take a particular approach to it. And the approach we are going to take is that, when we are buying core solid waste type of operations, we know those operations very well, we know exactly what we can do with them when we tuck them into our operations what cost synergies we can get. And so we can get a real good idea of what that company is going to look like once we bring it into our company and integrate it.", "And again there is one business but I know better than any business we can buy and that\u2019s ours. And so it basically comes down to a pretty simple fact, why would I pay anymore than our current multiple frankly I can\u2019t imagine we would pay our multiple. We would pay substantially less than our multiple for any business that we don\u2019t know as well as ours. And so when it comes to acquisitions is seller expectations are too high we have certainly proven in the past that we are willing to walk away from those. But I think there is going to plenty of targets out there that we can look at where we can get that great post-integration synergy that we can hopefully replace some or all of that $220 million of Wheelabrator EBITDA.", "Operator", "", "Your next question is from the line of Scott Levine with Imperial Company.", "Scott Levine - Imperial Capital", "So, on the volume side I think you mentioned, I don't know if it was Jim, 15% growth in construction and demolition. I was hoping maybe a little bit more color regarding the outlook for C&D, also special waste, the pipeline there and maybe some additional thoughts on coal ash and how that opportunity is potentially progressing?", "Jim Trevathan", "", "Sure. Keep in mind when we talk about C&D it\u2019s a small percentage of our overall revenue we increased it substantially in percentage terms 15.2% but it is still as an overall small piece. However, we like the direction, a lot of that came from parts of the South where we are seeing heavy construction, Florida and Texas to name a couple. So we think that\u2019s -- to the extent that this housing recovery and the recovery in general are intact and don\u2019t start to retrace their steps. We think C&D will continue to show nice improvements year-over-year.", "Special wastes is for us is a bigger category it includes energy services it includes manufacturing and industrial type waste, we feel very good about that, so we feel like the various entry in that line of business are higher than they would in a business like commercial it\u2019s tougher to get into next on an ExxonMobil refinery if you are not already in there and we have been in there for 30 years than it is to get into a small restaurant. So we like the special waste category and that is a real growth opportunity for us going forward. I can\u2019t say exactly what the expectation is for the whole waste stream in terms of percentage growth in 2015. But I will tell you that that as I mentioned earlier energy services which is a component of that will continue to grow nicely at 20 plus percent over the next several years.", "And then coal ash the promulgation of coal ash regulation is coming out here in December, hard to say exactly what that will mean to us but we have had a number of conversations with big public utilities that they are starting to take aggressive steps to remediate and ultimately they like working with big companies like Waste Management, so we feel good about the cool ash opportunity. There really are going to be a couple of different approaches that those utilities might take. One would be moving coal ash to a Landfill we think it will be subtitle D and subtitle C. Second would be asking somebody to come in and actually manage and operate their Landfills for them a lot of them have onsite Landfills and then the third would be some type of beneficial reuse clearly that would be their preference and we can help them with all three. So we like the opportunities across the special waste stream.", "David Steiner", "", "Jim I might also add for Scott\u2019s benefit on the hazardous waste side we have got facilities that really support our industrial DM&I sector, we have added to the rail capability we have got projects getting to move here in the fourth quarter by rail into a couple of our hazardous waste sites and that is an advantage that we offer to our customers.", "Scott Levine - Imperial Capital", "And then one other thing on the volume side before turning to price, I think you mentioned that you are still seeing 100 basis point drag to reported volume from lost national accounts. Can you remind us how that headwind, when might that taper off and maybe just your thoughts on the national account business in general at this point in time?", "David Steiner", "Yes, it should taper off sort of midyear next year and when we think about the national accounts frankly we think about them by splitting them depending on what kind of container they have out back right. So, if you have a compactor out in back we can\u2019t create a lot of route density and so we\u2019ve got to look at that sort of on a standalone basis right and we are not going to bid those large compactor accounts at a low margin. When you look at front-end container national accounts you can create a lot of route density and so the ability to make good money on those is a little bit higher because you can, the incremental cost to service them is much lower than servicing a compactor customer. And so when we look at our national accounts, we\u2019re not going to bid anything at a low margin but we would be willing to accept a lower margin on a front-end customer than we would on a compactor customer because we get such benefits out of the route densification.", "Jim Trevathan", "Dave one other point that for national account customers that we see real clear differentiation again are those manufacturing and industrial national accounts where our service offering whether it\u2019s solid waste business or special waste or hazardous waste add real value add to it our balance sheet and those guys like us and we expect to grow in that sector.", "Scott Levine - Imperial Capital", "One last one on pricing just very quickly, if you could remind us how much CPI linked pricing business is a percentage of your total revenue and where CPI was running right now, would you think that would be a headwind or a tailwind into 2015 if current trends remain constant?", "David Steiner", "Yes, we\u2019re sure looking for the day when CPI becomes a tailwind for us instead of a headwind right. About 40% of our business is CPI-linked and when we say CPI-linked remember that that can be all over the Board, it can be 100% of CPI can be some kind of localized CPI it can be a percentage of CPI but when we look forward I\u2019d tell you we aren\u2019t going to build our yield programs around CPI, it always amazes me that folks say well we would have gotten excellent yields if it wasn\u2019t for CPI, we take a little bit of a different approach. We say we\u2019re going to get x dollars of price despite CPI and so when we look at our pricing programs we say how many dollars are we going to get out of our pricing program to drop to the bottom-line if get 0% from CPI we\u2019re going to find those dollars somewhere else. And so, you\u2019ll never hear us sort of say that CPI is a drag on yield look that is the fact of life what we get paid to do is to drop certain amount of dollars to the bottom-line and if we can get those dollars from CPI that\u2019s great but if we can\u2019t get those dollars from CPI we\u2019re going to get those dollars somewhere else.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel Nicolaus", "Jim Fish, a little housekeeping first. Fourth quarter, what is the starting share count in the fourth quarter because if I read everything correctly you have spent $600 million and bought back stock in 3Q. What is my starting share count?", "Jim Fish", "I think it\u2019s 463 million.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, and -- sorry, say again.", "Jim Fish", "I will verify that but I think it\u2019s 463 million.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel Nicolaus", "And is there a plan to buy back more in the 4Q, or you did it, you did the $600 million and then --?", "Jim Fish", "No plan to buyback more in the fourth quarter we\u2019ve the $600 million ASR which 70% of it took place at the initiation of that so no plans outside of that $600 million ASR.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel Nicolaus", "And then you made a comment I think it was in your prepared remarks around D&A and about Wheelabrator and I think that then explains what my question was going to be that D&A was down yet your Landfill volume was up, so that is Wheelabrator as a percent of revenues. So what is the trend line, is it 9.1 is the way to think about it?", "Jim Fish", "9.1 on I would say that, that\u2019s hard to say but think that\u2019s probably about right.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Alright, now getting into the meat of this, on the price gate, David, I guess there is some confusion about what a stick means versus a carrot from your perspective, so --?", "David Steiner", "There is no confusion out in the field that Michael about what it...", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel Nicolaus", "Well, so just for our benefit. The carrot, clearly we tease you with a number but the stick in this case is it an all or nothing meaning if everybody wins or everybody loses, or is it very individual?", "David Steiner", "Yes the way we\u2019ve looked at it Michael is that when you got 17 areas like we\u2019ve got right, if 10 of the areas hit their target and 7 of them don\u2019t hit the target and the company doesn\u2019t hit the target guess who doesn\u2019t win, the shareholder doesn\u2019t win and we don\u2019t pay our folks including us unless the shareholder wins and so you\u2019ve got to do both out in the field we\u2019ve got to hit it from a corporate point of view and you have got to hit it at the local point of view. And look the only way our shareholders win is that the -- a shareholder doesn\u2019t care if 10 out 17 hit the target if the company doesn\u2019t get the target. And so what we\u2019ve always done and said the company has to hit the target and you have to hit the target in order to not be penalized on your bonus.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel Nicolaus", "", "Okay. And in the past this has been very focused around collection but you alluded in 2Q about disposal and subsequent public appearances by the company at various forums have talked about it, what is the mix between Landfill and collection in that gate? Are you distinguishing the two so that you incentivize both areas of focus? ", "David Steiner", "", "No, we don\u2019t want to overcomplicate the gate, right. And so what we\u2019re doing in 2015 and I think as everybody on the phone knows that our reported yield number is a very good approximation of where we\u2019ve gone with pricing but the real number that we look at is the core price number because that is the measure of how many dollars drop to the bottom-line from pricing remember what core price is. That is our price increases across all customers minus rollbacks and plus our fees and surcharges as in the fuel surcharge. And so those are the dollars that drop to the bottom-line. So when we do it we\u2019re going to do it based on core price because that again it doesn\u2019t matter what our yield is if we don\u2019t drop dollars to the bottom-line. Our shareholders don\u2019t get rewarded unless we drop dollars to the bottom-line. So what we\u2019re going to do is we\u2019re going to set a target just like we have over the last few years. We\u2019re going to set that core price target both at the company and at the local level and that\u2019s the number that we\u2019re going to use as part of the gate.", "Jim Fish", "", "Michael, my guess is that part of your question is related to MSW pricing there and Landfill pricing in general. If you look at MSW pricing over the last eight quarters where we\u2019ve been in the -- on the yield side, we\u2019ve been in the 1% to 2% range. This quarter was 1.6% and I\u2019m talking about MSW now was 1.6% kind of in the upper-end of that range. With volume over that same period of time being somewhere between flat and positive 5%, the eight quarters prior to that so 2011-2012 yield was between flat and 1% in MSW and volume was between negative 5% and flat. So we\u2019ve essentially seen a doubling of yield in the MSW line which is what we really look at it most closely when we\u2019re looking at Landfill pricing.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Fair enough. On volume, can you talk about your weight per yard trends and also the dollar per yard trends in front-end loader? ", "David Steiner", "", "Yes, the weight per yard is have been fairly steady but we have seen Michael, when I talk about the volumes I talk that -- again I don\u2019t expect to see a dramatic turn but I\u2019m much more optimistic that we continue to see progress than have been in the past. On the commercial side we have seen service increases, outpace service decreases for the last three quarters and five out of the last six quarters and then what we\u2019re talking about before, commercial volumes follow construction. So when you see high C&D volumes and you see improving industrial volumes the next step is you\u2019re going to start to see improving commercial volumes I think you have written about this quite a bit and I think you\u2019re absolutely right that I would expect that in 2015 again we\u2019re not going to see a huge dramatic turn but we\u2019re certainly going to see good steady progress on those commercial volumes.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, great.", "David Steiner", "", "Michael, by the way the other thing, when I talk about commercial volumes you\u2019ll always hear me talk about commercial volumes. I think the large companies have to look at this as, what we do in commercial volumes especially entire market and so if you go out and you just drop price to get volumes across your commercial base everybody else is going to follow you and before you know it again the price war on the commercial side and everybody starts losing money. And so when we look at our commercial business we say let\u2019s make sure that what we\u2019re doing in the commercial business is improving our volumes but not upsetting the pricing dynamics in the market. So what\u2019s the best way to do that quit losing your current customers, right, I mean if you\u2019re not stealing a customer from someone else you can\u2019t upset the market dynamic. So Jim Trevathan has put a task force together to make sure that our good customer service gets great. So that -- and the best way for us to grow our commercial volumes would be to retain our current customers and I\u2019d expect to see that occur in 2015.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel Nicolaus", "", "So more defense of the business as well?", "David Steiner", "", "Look, more defense of the business without using price right I mean we\u2019ve defended the business before by doing, using rollback and we don\u2019t want to go there. We want to defend the business by providing value to our customers. And so what you\u2019ll see in 2015 I think is an improving economy. Again when volumes are growing look, the way you upset a competitive dynamic is by going out and stealing everybody else\u2019s business. And we\u2019re big enough across the country that if we do that we\u2019re going to upset the competitive dynamic. So the best way to do it is to go get volumes when there is growing volumes right, when there is growing volumes we can take some new customers and get our fair share of the growth and that\u2019s not going to upset the market dynamics. When we keep more of our current customers that set the market dynamic and so now that we have seen the economy start to improve we are starting commercial volumes grow. I think we can make good progress on commercial volumes without upsetting the pricing dynamic.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Fair enough. Switching gears to recycling, you have all talked about this peak to trough $200 million profit hit, half of it was price, half of it was in your control. Can you talk about where you are in that part you control? You clearly have made progress in 2Q, 3Q but where are we in that $100 million, how much is left to recapture by running it better?", "David Steiner", "", "Yes I will take a shot at it and then maybe Jim you can add because really that\u2019s operating cost question Michael. It\u2019s half operating cost and half coaching of our customers to get them to improve the quality of what they bring us. I mean if they are bringing us trash in the front-end it eventually goes out the back-end as trash but we incur cost to process it. So part of that is an education process with our customers to help them understand that that\u2019s what they bring us has to be truly recyclables and not just what they call diversion of materials. The other side is operating efficiencies and I think we have made some nice improvement on operating efficiencies we have look at how many lines we should run at various plants what\u2019s the most efficient way to process recyclables. Really that was the sole improvement for the quarter it was not in pricing because as David mentioned OCC pricing was down 17% for us. The good news is as I said we are forcing ourselves to tackle this on the OpEx side as well as the coaching of our customers.", "Jim Fish", "", "And Michael what I would add that there is some residential contracts that don\u2019t have the parameters that we look for today in that contract that restrict the amount of residue for example detain the material, so that\u2019s the parameter that gets to the Jim\u2019s coaching if you will but part of it just a contractual issue as those contracts expire and we are able and if we have the industry following we are able to get the right kind of pricing and cost controls in place and waste the constituency of the waste material is right that lower the OpEx. So those two issues are tied together to add more color the Jim\u2019s statement. If I were picking an inning I don\u2019t think we are quite at the midpoint but we are approaching the midpoint maybe it is 25% to 50% of the way there of that 200 million. Obviously the pricing commodity side of it where we can\u2019t affect but the 100 million we can.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. So it\u2019s 25% to 35% of the 100 million is kind of.", "David Steiner", "", "Just one component perhaps on the OpEx side we look further a long but on the other side probably in that 25%-30% range.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay fair enough. There's another piece of this, which has been interesting, too, where you're going back and trying to get a processing fee. I think you have I think its Philadelphia you have talked about in the past recently, where this really made a meaningful difference. Where are we in the success of some of that activity?", "David Steiner", "", "Philadelphia is a great example Michael. We have that business it had a lot of material in it that was just not recyclable the contract expired we bid it at a profitable level with all the parameters that we have just talked about in mind, we lost it to the other competitor in the Philadelphia area and lost that volume but we picked up volume from third-party haulers that that recycler had in their mix and we are making money at that plant. So it\u2019s a great example of that issue. But we are making the money on that third-party volume is coming because we could price it correctly.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. And then last item for Jim Fish. So as I think about free cash flow, if I end the year this is net of divestitures, so 1.25, I take out Wheelabrator that is 120 if I am using a $100 million as the baseline for the risk, I'm getting $80 million of it in 2015, so I get that $80 million back. And then next component should be there's got to be some growth, there is ongoing operating leverage and then there's working capital. Is that the right way to think about it? And then lastly, I would really like to hear what you are doing on the working capital collecting your money faster and paying your bills slower.", "Jim Fish", "", "So the second question first here on working capital. Working capital was down slightly for the quarter. We showed some improvement in DSO of a half day versus Q3 of \u201913 but not the same improvement that we showed last year on the DSO front. Last year we showed a day and a half improvement. So I still think there is quite a bit of opportunity on DSO.", "On DPO we did show nice improvement in DPO on how quickly we pay we improved that by 2.1 days less value to improving DPO than improving DSO, but both are very valuable to us and we are moving in the right direction. I would have preferred to move a little on quicker on DSO than we did but I still think we have got both of those as improving opportunities going forward.", "Free cash flow is there is couple of things that affect free cash flow. As we think about 2015 and while we are not prepared obviously to give a number but we know that the cash taxes related to repatriation of Puerto Rico earnings that will not recur in 2015. So that\u2019s somewhat of a tailwind if you want to think about that that way. And then I think still TBD on what happens with bonus depreciation we didn\u2019t have it obviously this year, there is rumors that we will have it next year but we are not counting on it.", "I still think though that\u2019s and then of course the big impact on free cash flow will be divestiture of Wheelabrator so as David mentioned that\u2019s 120 million in cash in free cash flow that goes away call it January 1, 2015. So we\u2019re going have to kind of reorient everyone to think about 2015 whether it\u2019s EPS or free cash flow or EBITDA any of those financial metrics think about it excluding Wheelabrator as we go through a process of replacing, we\u2019ve said we want to replace at reasonable prices the EBITDA and free cash flow and if we can\u2019t then we\u2019ll go about it with other means by way of share repurchase and leverage neutrality.", "David Steiner", "", "And remember Michael on the re-org, we\u2019re basically getting four months of benefit in 2013 from the re-org so you get basically -- 2014 you get basically 8 months of benefit next year. So, it won\u2019t be $100 million next year to be a little less than 100.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel Nicolaus", "Right, I think Jim mentioned you're getting $10 million of it in the fourth quarter but if it is $100 million I'm playing with, I've got 90 million next year and there's sort of $15 million or $20 million of that's the non-labor, the rest is labor.

We are going on our second year of volume recovering in the industry and with commercial picking up now we've pretty much seen all the way streams get better. I'm just curious in your historical context, do you think that 2015 is the year where maybe some of your peers start to get behind pricing and we see a nice step-up there? Or do you think that we are probably looking at just a continued slow recovery and just overall industry pricing?", "David Steiner", "", "Yes, it\u2019s a great question. I think an improving volume and improving volume environment is always good for pricing right, whether you\u2019re selling widgets or garbage. And so I do think that what you\u2019ll see is more rational pricing behavior I do think what you\u2019ll see is the larger companies saying that it\u2019s a little easier to take the risk on loosing volumes by using price and we all know that you get a much bigger affect on the bottom-line from price than volume and so yes, I would say that as you see the volume environment improving you should see the pricing environment stabilize.", "Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Not to put words in your mouth, probably more of a slow recovery than a step function up?", "David Steiner", "", "Well look I can\u2019t control what anyone else does, I can only control what we do and to the earlier question we\u2019re pretty good at 2% to 2.5% yield. We don\u2019t have to do we can still improve don\u2019t get me wrong, but we know how to get that 2% to 2.5% yield. Now it\u2019s time for us to say okay, how do we get that yield, we\u2019re not going to give up on that yield but how do we get that yield and stem some of these volume losses. Frankly I think some of our competition is in a position whether they need to do a better job of getting higher margin volumes and focusing more on price because I think that look I think that we all know that what helps bottom-line and so we\u2019d always say as I think you\u2019ll see more balance in the overall industry where everybody is doing a little better on volume but everybody is doing better than 2% yield but again I can\u2019t tell you what they\u2019re going to do I can promise you what we\u2019re going to do. We\u2019re not going to go below that 2% yield sort of that 3.5% to 4% core price we\u2019re not going below that no matter what effect it has on volumes but what I\u2019m saying is I would expect the effects for us on volumes to be better in 2015 than it was in 2014.", "Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Great, I appreciate that. Maybe changing gears to the restructuring real quick. I completely understand the need to align corporate with some of your customer-facing employees. Can you maybe just walk through an example of the type of position that was eliminated, or maybe some of the various efficiency gains that you guys are pursuing that will help align the Company?", "David Steiner", "", "Yes, when we look at the reorganization and look what we did these were very good folks a lot of them been with the industry a long time very smart all doing good things for the company but what you find when your organization we call it the funnel one person sends something out to the field and says I need you to work on x and if that was all that went out to the field, the field wouldn\u2019t be distracted life would be good the problem is when you\u2019ve got 30 people doing that 30 things goes out to the field and all of a sudden the field gets distracted because they have too many things coming at them from too many directions we sort of call it the funnel. If there is too many things going in the funnel and heading out to the field so when we did the reorganization we said we\u2019re not going to look at it from a people point of view, we\u2019re going to look at it from a function point of view. And when you look at it from a function point of view if it\u2019s not driving one of what we call our five swim lanes and those as you can imagine revolve around customer service and pricing and cost but if it\u2019s not driving one of our five swim lanes if that function is not driving it, then it is a function that we can do without for now. It\u2019s nice to have not a must to have and so that\u2019s the way we looked at it, we looked at it frankly from a functional point of view how do we make sure that everything that we\u2019re doing at corporate is driving performance out in the field rather than slowing down performance out in the field and that was the philosophy we took and I think what you\u2019ll see is that, that philosophy will lead to much more alignment between our corporate staff and our field operations.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Charles Redding with BB&T Capital Markets.", "Charles Redding - BB&T Capital Markets", "Just a brief follow-up on national accounts, is it fair to assume that this segment does give you some degree of visibility with respect to forward expectations and what are you seeing fundamentally in terms of spending trends among the larger customers?", "David Steiner", "", "Yes look and again as Jim Trevathan pointed out, those national accounts expand a lot of different types of businesses from front-end container to compactors to industrial clients. But I\u2019m not sure that you see a dramatic change from those large national accounts. Those large national accounts are just like us, which is we\u2019re looking for ways to drive down costs through efficiency. And so when we work with large national accounts what we try to tell them is you can look at this based on price if you want but the way we look at it is we\u2019re going to start out with the particular price and then we\u2019re going to figure out how to save you money.", "So for example if you take that compactor customer, if our competition is picking up that customer three times a week and we\u2019re picking them up once a week it\u2019s going to cost us a lot less to do it. So how do we figure out, how to pick up that container when it\u2019s full rather than picking it up when it\u2019s half full. And so when we deal with national accounts our view is look we want that help you save money but we can help you save money while we continue to make money. If you can\u2019t take a national account view that what is going to cut the price and make less money. That\u2019s what we will not do because that this doesn\u2019t work for our business.", "But what we can do to find ways for each of those types of customers the front-end container, the compactors, those large industrial companies we can find ways where we can make the margins we want to make and they can lower their cost. So for example the manufacturing industrial customer to buy recycled materials like metals that help them lower their overall cost and we can do that better than anyone. So when we approach those national accounts we do look at it as how we do save them money, but how do we save them money while maintaining our profitability.", "Charles Redding - BB&T Capital Markets", "And then quickly in terms of fleet spend, does the drop in crude really have any impact on the current appetite for C&G and I guess if not, is there a price on crude that might impact how you kind of approach future purchases?", "David Steiner", "", "Yes right now that differential is still over $1.5 and so I would say it doesn\u2019t affect what we\u2019re doing on fleet purchases. And as you have seen oil has come down a little bit short but natural gas has come down also. We\u2019re still a long way away from the stepping point where we\u2019d say we want to be diesel. But even with neutrality this is also about our customers. Our customers are demanding a cleaner truck and clearly natural gas is going to be cleaner than diesel.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs", "I wanted to ask about the acquisition landscape. You talked about the multiples that the folks are asking. Can you to put a little more color around where the relevant ranges are for multiples? And then I think you implied that they see elevated. What do you think is driving that because looking at the underlying fundamentals in the business, CPI is pretty low and so that is tough for pricing and volumes are still sluggish and what is sort of driving that elevated multiple for deals out there?", "David Steiner", "", "Yes, it\u2019s not just an elevated multiple it\u2019s also that folks are doing better just like us, everybody is doing better from an EBITDA point of view and so the valuations have gone up both from a performance point of view and anytime that you\u2019re in an improving market and folks have a lot of confidence going forward on their business. But it comes down to this, what we\u2019re trying to do is to buy their business at trailing earnings and if they\u2019re looking forward in the future and saying gosh trailing earnings, I\u2019m not sure if those earnings are going to get much better, so trailing earnings looks good to me they\u2019ll sell out a certain multiple. If they say gosh, those forward earnings look really good to me they will sell in different multiple. So for example we aren\u2019t buying businesses in the recycling business but there is not a lot of people feeling greatly confident about their recycling business and that\u2019s going to drive to a lower multiple, because they say, look, I\u2019ll take five to six times for my business because I don\u2019t see my EBITDA going up dramatically over the next five years.", "On the solid waste side it\u2019s a little bit different I think people are seeing EBITDA going up and if you look at it from just discounted cash flow model point of view, if you think your business is going to get a lot better over the next five years you\u2019re going to want to hire multiple for your business. So it\u2019s really just pure sort of finance and what you believe about the market going forward. And so I still think back to the original part of the question, I still think that we can buy good local businesses at call it a post synergy number of five to six times EBITDA as you are buying larger sort of regional type of competitors that multiple is going to be a little bit higher because you get a bigger slug of business with one transaction but post synergies I would expect those to be in sort of 6 time to 7.5 time earning, 6 times to 8 times earnings -- EBITDA I am sorry. And so anytime you can buy a business at 5 times to 7 times EBITDA or 6 times to 8 times EBITDA you are buying at a below our current market multiple and that makes it accretive to our shareholders.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs", "", "And just one last question for me on the collection volume side, it's been asked a couple of different ways but had a little bit of a follow-up there. So as I look at the last four quarters I think specifically that commercial collection volume number has been down 3% to 5%. So the fourth quarter of \u201814 would really be the first quarter where we are going to be comping material volume decline in that segment. So how are you guys thinking about commercial collection volumes going forward? Is the expectation that you should see the volume erosion moderate there even as you pursue your pricing initiatives? Or is the expectation that we will continue to see that 3% to 5% volume decline in the commercial collection business as we go forward over the next 12 months?", "David Steiner", "Yes, and again look it would be very easy for me to sit here and say to you all we are going to see that commercial volume turn positive we could do that tomorrow, the problem is in order to do that we have got to put a lot of feet on the street, take a lot of business from a lot of people, and we all know what\u2019s going to happen to the competitive dynamic if we do that. And so we are taking a little bit more of a measured approach towards the commercial business, and that is let\u2019s make sure that we get our fair share of growth and let\u2019s make sure that we don\u2019t lose our customers that we can reduce the churn rate. And if we can do that we can get volumes without upsetting the competitive dynamic, now that means that the turn in commercial volumes is slower than it would be if we put a 1000 sales people on the street and started trying to upset competitive market dynamics. But I would absolutely believe that we are going to see that trend I would be disappointed if we see that trend coming out of 2015, still at the negative 5%. We haven\u2019t put pencil to paper to see do we believe it\u2019s going to go below that negative 3% but I certainly expect the trend line on that to be positive throughout 2015.", "Operator", "", "Your next question is from the line of Barbara Noverini with Morningstar.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar", "", "Can you just give us a quick reminder of how the organizational structure of the recycling business might have changed as a result of your restructuring actions, how is the field and corporate level responsibility for the business shifted, and where does recycling fit into these lines of sight that you have described? Is it a more integrated way of managing the business than it might have been pre-2012?", "David Steiner", "", "Yes, so what we did with the recycling operations is right now I think we all know that the biggest challenge in our recycling operations is an operational challenge. How do we make sure that we continue to make money when we are getting contaminated load. So what we did with recycling was we didn\u2019t do anything at the field level the responsibility of the field level didn\u2019t change. At the corporate level we said this is really a process improvement organization that we have here at the corporate level. And so let\u2019s run it like that. And so we took our recycling operations and we basically put them under the gentlemen Puneet Bhasin who is running our operating programs. So whether it is driving efficiency in our routing system or driving efficiency in our recycling plants they are both about driving efficiency. And so we basically took that operating portion and put it under our operating officer. The ultimate responsibility remained in the field, the ultimate responsibility for the profitability of that recycling facility remained down the field.", "Operator", "", "We will now turn the call over to our CEO, David Steiner for closing comments.", "David Steiner", "", "Thank you all for joining us. Just as in Houston we are starting to see the good weather from a weather point of view, we are starting to see very good weather from our business point of view.

During the first quarter, our solid waste operations performed well, with strong yield performance offsetting weaker-than-expected volumes. Our overall business earned $0.39 per diluted share, with about $0.09 of impact from short-term headwind. Year-over-year, we had a negative impact of $0.02 per diluted share from our waste-to-energy operations and $0.01 per diluted share from stock option grants under our long-term compensation program. We also had negative impacts of $0.03 per diluted share from our cost reduction initiatives and a negative $0.03 per diluted share from our growth initiatives. Without these, our earnings would have been $0.48 per diluted share, which demonstrates the strength of our solid waste business.", "Spending on our cost reduction initiatives will slow in the second quarter, and we should begin to see year-over-year benefits in the third quarter. Our portfolio of growth initiatives, like Bagster and medical waste, will negatively affect the second and possibly the third quarters, but should become profitable by the end of the year. And our waste-to-energy business will have a small negative effect in the second quarter but will begin to add year-over-year earnings growth in the third or fourth quarter. So these headwinds should be very short term, and we expect them to drive operational and earnings improvement for years to come.", "During the first quarter, revenue increased by $168 million or 5.7% from the prior year quarter. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of positive year-over-year revenue comparison. Major drivers of our revenue improvement are improved recycling volumes at higher commodity prices, the continued emphasis on year-over-year yield increases and acquisitions. ", "Internal revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal operations was 2.8% in the quarter. This represents the highest yield since the third quarter of 2009 and the third quarter of sequential growth. In the coming quarters, many of our fees and surcharges will anniversary, causing downward pressure on yield growth. CPI is an important component of pricing in our municipal sector. CPI increased about 1% for the first 3 months of 2011, consistent with our expectations, but below the level we saw in the first quarter of 2010. ", "We had approximately a 40 basis point reduction in yield from CPI in the first quarter. Many of our contracts adjust on July 1, so the low CPI will continue to negatively affect yield in the second half of the year. Despite these pricing pressures, we'll continue to maintain our pricing discipline and fully expect to achieve or exceed our full year yield target. ", "The combined internal revenue growth from yield in the industrial, commercial and residential lines of our collection business was 3.3% in the first quarter. Commercial and industrial yields were 4.1% and 3.4%, respectively. The yield component of internal revenue growth in our residential line of business was 2.3%.", "Both commercial and industrial new business pricing increased compared to the first quarter of last year. The commercial increase represents the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. Our customer churns have been improving steadily over the last 3 quarters and improved to 9.5% in the first quarter of 2011.", "On the volume side of the business, internal revenue growth from volume declined 1.7% in the quarter, a 10 basis point sequential improvement from the fourth quarter of 2010. We had expected that volumes would be stronger in the first quarter. However, the winter weather certainly had a negative effect on volumes. Both our commercial and residential collection lines of business saw a year-over-year volume decline of 5.6%. ", "The residential line of business improved 30 basis points from the fourth quarter, which is the first sequential improvement in residential volumes since the fourth quarter of 2009. Industrial volumes declined by 2.8% on a year-over-year basis, which was the seventh straight quarter of sequential improvement. By focusing on pricing, we were able to overcome the declining volumes and grow income from operations and margins year-over-year in the collection line of business.", "In the landfill side of the business, first quarter 2011 internal revenue growth from volume improved by 1.6% compared to the first quarter of 2010. C&D volumes improved 6.4% year-over-year, up from the flat volumes that we experienced in the fourth quarter. Internal revenue growth from volume for special waste was positive 2.9% year-over-year. As you know, special waste is generally more affected by weather than other volumes, so the severe winter weather had a bigger effect on this segment. But we still see strength in the pipeline for special waste volumes and expect them to improve during the quarters.  For MSW, internal revenue growth from volume was negative 6.7% year-over-year.", "On the yield front, all of the waste streams had positive revenue growth from yield for the first quarter. The landfill business overcame the weather drag on volumes with strong revenue growth from yield. And income from operations in the landfill line businesses also improved in the first quarter of 2010. When looking at the combinations of the collection and the landfill lines of business, income from operations grew 4% compared to the first quarter of 2010, and income from operations margin grew over 30 basis points.", "In our waste-to-energy operations, income from operation has declined in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2010. The expiration of a long-term electric power capacity agreement had a $6.3 million negative effect in the quarter. Also affecting the decline were upgrades to our acquired facility in Virginia, lower electricity revenues and weather, all of which are expected to improve as we progress throughout the remainder of 2011. For the rest of 2011, we expect to have an additional $0.02 earnings per share year-over-year drag in the second quarter, with the third and fourth quarters being flat to slightly positive year-over-year.", "Turning to our recycling business. Increased commodity prices and volume contributed about $0.03 of positive year-over-year earnings per diluted share in the first quarter of 2011, which was consistent with our expectations for the first quarter. Commodity prices have increased approximately 18% when compared with last year. We had expected prices to come down during the year but so far, they've remained strong. As prices continue to remain strong, we should see about a $0.02 earnings per share benefit in each of the second and third quarters and no net effect in the fourth quarter.", "With respect to solid waste volumes, through the last weeks of March and the first few weeks of April, we've seen some encouraging signs. We expect to see our normal seasonal improvement during the quarter, leading to steady improvement in the second and third quarters such that 2011 volume should be closer to flat when compared with the full year 2010. Of course, it's difficult to extrapolate first quarter volumes to the rest of the year, particularly due to severe weather effects in the first quarter, so we'll have more clarity about our volume projections after we see second quarter volumes.", "So we made good progress in the first quarter, and we fully expect our cost reduction program and growth initiatives to turn from headwinds to tailwinds in the second half of the year. So with improving volumes, our customer focus, growth initiatives and our continued focus on operational excellence, we're confident that we're on track to meet our full year adjusted earnings forecast of $2.24 to $2.30 per diluted share. ", "And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.", "Robert Simpson", "Thank you, David. I will begin by discussing operating costs. These costs increased by $114 million in the first quarter to 64.3% of revenue. Cost of goods sold increased $67 million in the quarter mainly because of rebates due to higher recycling commodity prices. These higher prices, net of rebates, had resulted in an increase in earnings per diluted share from our recycling operations of approximately $0.03 in the quarter. ", "Direct fuel costs increased approximately $27 million, primarily because of a 27% increase in diesel fuel. Subcontractor costs increased $15 million in the quarter, primarily relating to the increase in special waste volume and increased fuel costs at our transfer station operations. In 2010, we redesigned our fuel surcharge to better match changes in diesel fuel costs. In the first quarter, the redesign worked as planned as the fuel surcharge offset the increased costs of direct fuel and other fuel increases that are included in our subcontractor costs. ", "Maintenance costs increased $11 million due to planned maintenance projects at our waste-to-energy and our landfill-gas-to-energy facilities. Operating costs at businesses we acquired accounted for $24 million of the increase. ", "Foreign currency translation for our Canadian operations accounted for an increase in operating costs of approximately $6 million. Our SG&A costs increased $31 million year-over-year, and as a percentage of revenue, increased 30 basis points to 12.3%. The increased costs in SG&A relate primarily to our strategic growth plans and cost reduction initiatives and expenses related to our stock option grants under our long-term compensation program. ", "Our growth initiatives, which include medical waste and Bagster, had a negative $0.03 per diluted share impact on the quarter. We expect our growth initiatives to have a negative earnings per share impact in the second and third quarters and to be flat to slightly positive in fourth quarter. ", "One of our 3 long-term strategic goals is to continuously improve our operational efficiency. During our fourth quarter conference call, we told you that we had brought in outside consultants to assist us with initiatives to reduce costs and improve efficiency in areas like procurement, routing [ph] and logistics and the centralization of certain functions such as dispatch. ", "The up-front costs for these initiatives were approximately $20 million in the first quarter. The outside consulting costs are expected to be a negative $0.02 per share in the second quarter and a negative $0.01 per share in each of the third and fourth quarters as we internalize the work of the consultants. The benefits from our cost reduction initiatives are expected to more than offset these costs in the third and fourth quarter and accelerate into 2012. ", "In summary, in the first quarter, we faced $0.09 of EPS headwinds. We expect these headwinds to be approximately a negative $0.06 per share in the second quarter, consisting of a negative $0.02 per share from each of our waste-to-energy operations, our growth initiatives and our cost reduction initiatives. We expect these investments will benefit the second half of the year, accelerate in 2012 and will lead to sustained margin expansion.", "Interest expense for the first quarter increased $9 million compared with the prior year period. This is primarily due to higher up-front costs and usage fees on the revolving credit facility that we executed in June 2010. On March 31, 2011, our weighted average cost of debt was 5.6%, and our debt-to-total-capital ratio for the quarter was 58%, consistent with our target ratio of about 60%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 18% at the end of the quarter. ", "Our income tax rate as reported for the first quarter of 2011 was 35.9%. Included in the first quarter effective tax rate are adjustments to our net deferred taxes, including a $2.2 million expense related to an income tax rate increase in Illinois. For 2011, we expect the recurring effective tax rate to be approximately 35%.", "Turning to cash flow. First quarter 2011 net cash provided by operating activities was $600 million. This represents a 21% increase over the first quarter of 2010 and is the highest first quarter net cash provided by operating activities since the first quarter of 2006. The increase was driven primarily by changes in our working capital. ", "Our capital expenditures for the first quarter were $316 million. We still anticipate spending between $1.35 billion and $1.45 billion on capital expenditures during 2011. Our free cash flow for the first quarter was $289 million, which is $36 million better than the prior year quarter despite an increase in capital expenditures of $61 million. This performance puts us well on the way of achieving our expected free cash flow for 2011 of between $1.25 billion and $1.35 billion. ", "In the first quarter of 2011, we paid $162 million in dividends and we repurchased $63 million of our common stock, continuing our long-standing emphasis to return cash to our shareholders. We also completed approximately $100 million in business acquisitions. ", "As we go forward with our cost reduction and growth initiatives, it is encouraging to see our traditional solid waste business perform so well. Through the dedication of hard-working employees, we were able to achieve solid performance in this quarter. And for that, we thank them. ", "And with that, Nicole, let's open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley.", "Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks for taking my questions. On the C&D, it sounds like a good bounce back despite any weather impacts. What's your outlook for the rest of the year and into 2012? Any feel for what the pattern might be?", "David Steiner", "Yes, when you look at the C&D volumes, obviously, you also have to look at the industrial volumes. And what we've seen over the last few quarters is fairly consistent growth in that. Now obviously, industrial also still down in the quarter, but you're starting to see that they've improved quarter-to-quarter now for quite a while. So we would fully expect to see those C&D volumes at sort of positive 5% to 10% continue for the rest of the year.", "Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great. And any update on what you see for landfill pricing as a sort of a target for this year? Do you still think mid-single digits for pricing or even higher is possible for the full year?", "David Steiner", "Yes. The first quarter, our pricing was fairly consistent at landfill where it's been for the last year or two. I would think that two things are going to help us improve that during the year. First, you got seasonality. So as volumes improve, you ought to have more opportunity for pricing. And we've always said that sometimes, high fuel costs are our friend, right? We get to pass through the higher fuel costs through our fuel surcharge. That worked very well this quarter, having no net effect on the quarter. But with our landfill being positioned in a lot of places in advantaged geographic location, it now becomes a lot more expensive to drive past our landfill and to bring it to a competing landfill. So both of those factors should help us in pricing during the course of the year.", "Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great. And just one more question for me. What do you feel is driving the improved recycling volumes? Do you think that's mainly cyclical as the economy gets better? Or do you discern any longer-term trends there?", "David Steiner", "Yes, I think -- generally the long-term trend has been that demand from Asia primarily China, has been driving recycled commodity prices. The encouraging thing is that because it's in consolidation with the mills in the United States, you've actually seen the United States domestic mills requiring more recycled papers. So for the first time that I can recall, you're seeing a healthy domestic market and a healthy export market, and I think that bodes well for the rest of the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Just a couple questions. The first question is on volume. Could you give us any sense of what the underlying volume decline is if we adjust for the severe weather impact? And then also you are guiding volume flat for the year. I'm wondering what you're assuming on seasonality within that guidance and what you believe the ramp-up looks like in volumes for the balance of the year?", "David Steiner", "Right. First off on the weather, we think that the weather in the first quarter was probably about a 30 basis point drag on volumes. For the rest of the year, from a seasonality point of view, when we look at last weeks of March and the first weeks of April and the lines in our industrial and in our landfill line, we're seeing more weeks that have been year-over-year positive than negative. We're still seeing some negative weeks but more weeks in positive than negative. Frankly, we're still not seeing a lot of movement in the commercial volumes. We've been talking about that now for 3 or 4 quarters. And so the year-over-year uptick will be driven primarily through landfill volumes and improved industrial hauls.", "Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Okay. And then just a question on pricing. That came in higher than expected. Could you give us a sense of where the upside is coming from? It's obviously not coming from CPI. It seems like landfill pricing is still what it was a quarter or two ago. How aggressive are you being on pricing new business?", "David Steiner", "Yes, that's a great question because I think it's very perceptive. We're not seeing yet a large pop from landfill pricing and overall IRG. Certainly, CPI has been a drag. What we've seen is that our new business pricing has been driving it fairly dramatically, and then our fees and surcharges have been driving it. So the container service fee that we instituted a couple of quarters ago, the environmental fees still is driving it and that will anniversary in the second quarter. And our administrative fee provides some benefit in the quarter. That also anniversaries in the second quarter. So you've got -- so what's going to have to drive it going forward, so we expect to see some headwinds that I said from CPI and from the anniversary-ing of fees. What's going to have to drive it going forward is a continued -- as you point out, continued new business pricing continue to increase, price increases on our commercial line of business, which we've been pretty good about doing in the last 5 years, and then better landfill pricing in the back half of the year.", "Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Okay. Just last question on capital allocation, if you could just touch on how you're thinking about that. It seems like you've backed away sort of a little bit in terms of going after any large deals over the next 14 months. If you could just update us there.", "Robert Simpson", "Hamzah, we don't comment specifically on anything. But we think there's a pretty good pipeline for the acquisitions, and we will continue to pursue them. I don't see us doing anything gigantic, but I do see us continuing to look at the pipeline and playing where we think we can get some value.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Levine with JPMorgan.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "So your pricing number is stronger than we expected and looks like it's accelerating despite some of the headwinds that you mentioned. Could you talk about how that came in relative to internal expectations? And given the fact that inflation is starting to move back up, could you talk maybe about how that should impact pricing within your business as you move through this year into next? Should we think about factoring in, like you said, the fees anniversary-ing, what have you? The expectation for the year, I think you mentioned in the last call, at 2%. How should we think about all of that playing out in pricing trends through this year and into next?", "David Steiner", "Obviously, with the strong start we got in the first quarter, our 2% goal, we certainly believe we should exceed that for the year. And then the way, Scott, that I'd sort of look at pricing for the year is that the back half of the year, we're going to have the headwind of CPI and we're going to have the headwinds of anniversary-ing fees. But then in 2012, the CPI should become a tailwind, which hopefully offsets the headwinds from the anniversary-ing of the fees. And so then you're back to sort of a normal state, if you will, where pricing is driven more by the traditional methods of pricing, which is annual price increases on your customers at both the collection and landfill line of business. So the back half of the year, I would expect -- we're going to maintain our pricing discipline. And so I'm not surprised by the 2.8% in the first quarter. I wouldn't be surprised to see that come down a little bit in the remaining quarters of 2011, but then I would expect to see it go back up in 2012 as we start getting the tailwinds from the CPI benefits.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Understood. Additionally, with regard to the quarter, you had some maybe unforeseen headwinds with weather and fuel, which you didn't quantify in the release. Was the first quarter result, relative to your initial expectations, pretty much consistent with internal expectations? Just trying to get a sense of whether we should be favoring the higher or the lower end of the guidance range at this point in time.", "David Steiner", "Yes, I would say it was fairly consistent with internal expectations. We had the $0.01 from stock options, which was not built into our budget when we put our budget together. We probably had a little bit, probably $0.01 worth of weather that we didn't build into our budget. But the rest of it was pretty much built in. And so I would say it was consistent with our internal expectations. Look, you all can see it just like we see it, which is we've got to get those cost savings in the back half of the year if we're going to make our number. And right now, we've got some fairly good visibility into that, and we're pretty confident we can get it done.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Understood. One last one, if I may. I saw you made an acquisition here of water treatment assets in the Marcellus. Could you talk maybe about some of the -- maybe the acquisitions, I think you said were $100 million in the quarter. Maybe some color around some of the areas. Is most of that solid waste, or there's some niche areas where you're looking to increase your capabilities?", "David Steiner", "Yes, most of that was in recycling assets along the Atlantic Coast and solid waste acquisitions. What you're talking about the water treatment acquisition in the Marcellus Shale was a fairly small acquisition. But it's interesting that as we've turned the company to focus more on growth initiatives, you've had people that have taken it upon themselves to find ways to grow. And that Marcellus Shale is a great example of an area where we were already providing services, disposal of drill cuttings into our landfill. And by doing that, we started to recognize there was a need for water and for water services, for frac-ing fluid, and we were able to get into that at a fairly low cost and to supplement our offering, with our landfill offerings Pennsylvania. So it's been a really nice success story for us.", "Robert Simpson", "That's a real competitive offering.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ellis with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jonathan Ellis - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Wanted to first talk about -- I realize all your commentary was tied to year-over-year comparisons. But I guess what I struggle with little bit is when I look at the fourth quarter 2010 results and the  first quarter of 2011, your pricing volume trends were fairly consistent, yet you saw a pretty material sequential decline, about 300 basis points sequential decline in gross margin. So I'm just trying to get a sense, presumably the costs, the spending on growth initiatives and cost savings wasn't significantly different but I'm just trying to understand, is there anything on a sequential basis that we should be sensitive to that drove the gross margin down other than -- and I realize weather was clearly a factor but other than the weather?", "David Steiner", "The weather was certainly a part of it. But I think you also have to look at the growth initiatives, which we really spent substantial amounts on the cost side -- I'm sorry, the cost initiatives. We really started investing in January. And so those are 100 basis points off the gross margin right there. In our waste-to-energy business, we knew we had some issues. We're going to address it in one of our plants. We forecasted it in our work and that was another 60 basis points of impact that we had. So I really think that's the driving piece of it. It's those particular items that make up the headwinds that we've already talked about.", "Jonathan Ellis - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay, that's helpful. Maybe you could talk a little bit about -- I know you said commercial volumes haven't picked up that much, but can you talk a little bit about weight per container? Is that showing any improvement or was that really flat as well?", "David Steiner", "It was close to flat. Frankly, what we've been seeing over the last 3 years is that, that container weights have been generally down a couple of quarters where it's been up. And so it was improved, it was less negative, but it was still just slightly negative.", "Jonathan Ellis - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then just on landfill pricing, to make sure I'm clear, I think last quarter you talked about a target of 5% to 7% for this year for the open markets and I believe contracts that are coming up for repricing, if I'm not mistaken. Can you talk about -- based on what you saw in the first quarter, do you still think 5% to 7% is achievable for the year, or is it going to be too much of a catch-up required to get to that target?", "David Steiner", "Yes. Jon, I think as you're well aware, sort of the first quarter with the volume being down, it's sort of hard to be too aggressive on pricing. But when we looked at it even in the first quarter, about 2/3 of our landfills had price increases at them, and nearly 50% of those price increases were over 3%. So we made some good progress in the first quarter, but we've got to make better progress. If we want to do that 5% to 7% goal, I think you're absolutely right. We've got to make some strong progress here in the second and third quarters. Whether we hit that for the full year or whether we hit that as a run rate, I think, is still an open question.", "Jonathan Ellis - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the volume outlook, to make sure I'm clear, I think -- and maybe we're splitting hairs here a little bit, but I think last quarter you said that volumes for the year could be flat to slightly positive. Just so I'm clear, is the commentary now on could be close to flat was just a function of what happened in the first quarter or is that also reflective of a changed view on the second, third or fourth quarter?", "David Steiner", "No, I think you've hit the nail right on head. When we looked at the first quarter, we were stronger on pricing than we thought we would be. And so we said we think we'll meet or exceed the budget on pricing. And we were weaker than we thought we'd be on volumes. So we decided to say it's going to be closer to flat for the year, obviously. But like we said, the first quarter, it's hard to tell what's going on in the first quarter because of weather. And then we also had some pretty bad weather right at the end of the year in the fourth quarter. And so after we see the second quarter volumes, we'll get a better feel for what we think the full year will be. But we thought, given the negative 1.7% in the first quarter, we want to be a little bit more conservative on volumes for the year. But again, we'll know more after we see second quarter seasonality trends.", "Jonathan Ellis - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just my final question, just on the core price for the year. And I appreciate the commentary around the effects of CPI and then anniversary of the fees. Can you just help us to sort of understand, holding your current prices constant in terms of whatever you've achieved year-to-date, what is going to be sort of the stair step impact of the anniversary of the fees and then the CPI resets on July 1? If you can help us understand how that flows through.", "David Steiner", "Yes, so when you look at our fees, there are 3 primary fees that we have. We've got our environmental fee, which went up last year, and so it will anniversary starting in June. We got about an $11 million benefit from that in the first quarter. We don't expect that to be a benefit in the back half of the year, could be even slightly negative, but basically flat to the back half of the year. We've got our administrative fee, which gave us an $8 million benefit in the first quarter. And again, that anniversaries in the second quarter, so we expect to get no benefit of that from that. And then we got our new container service fee, which was $11 million benefit in Q2. We'd expect to see roughly that amount in the remaining quarters because that was not one that we instituted last year. So net-net, you're looking at sort of a $10 million to $15 million drag to pricing from the anniversary-ing of the fees.", "Jonathan Ellis - BofA Merrill Lynch", "And then just on the CPI?", "David Steiner", "Jon, on the CPI, what we've seen obviously is CPI going up a little bit. But most of those July 1 contracts actually price off of March-to-March timing, right? And so you'd say, you're not going to get the full benefit of the March-to-April quarter increase in CPI because they don't -- on July 1, they don't trigger off, off July 1 CPI, right? So what you'll see is that in the back half of this year, we won't see a benefit from CPI. In fact, we'll still see a little bit of a drag if you use March-to-March, April-to-April type CPI. We'll start to see that benefit on the contracts that reprice on January 1, 2012. So that's why CPI will be a drag in 2011 and turn in hopefully to a tailwind in 2012.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Wunderlich Securities.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "Can you just dig a little deeper into the waste-to-energy data, because I'm struggling a little bit based on the charts you've provided. Revenues were actually up year-over-year. You show in your yield calculation flat from a disposal standpoint, flat from an energy standpoint, yet it's a drag. So this has to be a cost issue. I'm trying to understand what's happening in the costs.", "David Steiner", "There's 3 components, Michael. First is the loss of the capacity plant payment, and that was more of a revenue issue than a cost issue. But then we had additional repairs and maintenance that we accelerated into the first quarter of 2011 for the plant we bought in Portsmouth, Virginia last year. It was work that needed to be done. We talked about this on the fourth quarter that the maintenance hadn't been done in that plant for quite a while and just catching that up turned out to be more expensive than we thought. It's not cost we won't spend some day, it's just cost we had to move up until now. And then we had some timing of other repair and maintenance operations that moved into this quarter. And that's why we expect in the second half of the year, it won't be quite as much of an issue.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "Okay, that's what I thought was going to be the answer. So you pulled forward a lot of maintenance.", "David Steiner", "Yes, that's right.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "Okay. And then the stock options, that was a negative $0.01 in 1Q. How do I think about the options layering it out for the rest of the year?", "Robert Simpson", "That should be it. Michael, that hit relates to the fact that under our option plan -- and by the way, we have a bit more mix. We changed our mix of options versus performance shares to put more into options. And this is silly, but the retirement provision in our option plan allows those people who are retiring and eligible to vest immediately and you have to take the hit immediately.", "David Steiner", "To continue that.", "Robert Simpson", "To continue that. But even though -- because it allows us to continue vesting even after they retired. I -- first, I'm a beneficiary of that so I should both feel bad and good about it. But anyway, that's really the cause of it. And once that's booked, you don't have any other continuing impact on it.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "Okay. So you've taken your onetime hit for this year, and do we think about that as a first quarter event kind of going forward?", "Robert Simpson", "Yes, it will be -- really only if the mix changes.", "David Steiner", "Should be the same thing next year unless we decide to change the retirement provision.", "Robert Simpson", "One of us is in favor of it.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "The CPI, help me a little bit here. Everybody is talking about CPI, but you all are actually talking about this more negatively than everybody else is. There's a more positive bend on CPI from overall in the market but then strictly specifically related to your peers. So I'm having a -- I mean there's no question we're seeing some inflation and I'm having a little trouble why you were counting it as a negative at this point.", "David Steiner", "There's absolutely no doubt, Michael, that we will see a benefit from CPI. It's just a matter of when do you see the benefit. And what you're seeing is CPI going up in the last couple of months. But again, our contracts don't use current CPI. They -- basically, the June -- most of our contracts are June 1 -- I'm sorry, July 1, January 1 and the July 1 contracts will use CPI generally on a March-to-March, April-to-April basis. And there, you're seeing more in line with 1%, 1% to 2% type CPIs. So year-over-year, it will continue to drag in the second half of the year. But the better CPI that we're seeing today will end up going into our repricing in January of next year. So we'll get the benefit, it's just a matter of when. We won't get it in the back half of the year. We'll start to get it in the first quarter of 2012.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "Okay. And then help me get comfortable with why you have such confidence that the $0.03 drag for costs becomes $0.02 and goes to maybe $0.01 and then 0 and then it's additive going into '12...", "Robert Simpson", "Michael, let me, let me...", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "Just one second -- I mean, for a long time, we've heard Waste Management talk about investing to save and it's hard to see the save. We've seen the investing, but help us get comfortable why you really believe that.", "Robert Simpson", "Yes, Michael, that's a very good question. I was going to clarify a little bit. The $0.01 that we talked about that are -- will be going through SG&A, the benefits will be going through operating expense primarily in this year. And some of them will go through SG&A, but mostly it will go through operating expense. And we do expect the benefits to be seen starting toward the end of the second quarter and well into  the -- and to be relatively significant in the third and fourth quarter. Here's why we believe it. The 2 areas we're focusing on primarily -- there's a lot of areas we're focusing at. The 2 are procurement and the routing logistics side of the business. With procurement, it's pretty easy to see where the opportunities are. And once you start the process of renegotiating contracts and getting through that whole effort, you can see that the benefits are going to come and we have good visibility to that. So that one, we're quite comfortable with, and we think there's a significant opportunity there. In the other area, the routing and logistics, we expect there will be some benefit this year. We're spending a little bit more in the second half on that than we will with procurement. The nice thing about procurement is once you've gotten it going, you internalize it pretty quickly and you take it from there and you don't really need to have the consulting costs to help. On the routing and logistics, that's going to take a little bit more time. We've already started the process of taking a redesigned -- or the effort to taking our redesigned processes supported by technology into one area, one market area, where we're about to begin to roll it out in a second market area. Because of the complication of it, we're taking time to do it. We found that just putting a new technology on a truck isn't enough unless you really take the time to retrain people to use the information and change the processes. And that's just going to take a little longer. But that gives us comfort when that will take us into next year, the procurement benefits will continue, the routing and logistics benefits will continue. And then the third area we talked about was consolidating certain functions. And in order to do that, you got to go through a process redesign, pick a location, find the right people and then staff that function. And that's something that will take a couple of years, to me, a good 12 to 18 months of organized and do. So it will take a little longer for those things to get into to see the benefits. But the pieces from the procurement and some of the others, you will see pretty quickly.", "David Steiner", "And Michael, the sort of way I look at it is as we look at the downturn with the decreasing volumes, frankly, I'd been extremely impressed on the costs side on how our folks have been able to flex down costs. And when -- as Bob talked about, when you look at procurement and the logistics department, they've done a great job at flexing down costs and generally maintaining margins, increasing margins year-over-year, every year since I've been here even though we've had declining volumes. But having said all that, you get to a point where you're not getting as much traction here. As Bob talked about, the onboard computers, we were getting benefits from that. But you got -- sometimes you have to bring in sort of outside eyes to take a look at it and show you some new ways to do things. And that's exactly what we've done here. It's been very good. We're seeing some really good progress. And then ultimately, it becomes the way you do business and you get rid of those outside eyes. And so that's the process we're going through right now. Obviously, it takes some investment to do that, but we're counting on that to being a fairly quick payback in 2011 and then accelerating into 2012.", "Robert Simpson", "So you'll see  2 things in the second half of the year. You'll see the consulting costs coming down, you'll see the benefits picking up.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "Okay. And then I know you -- this isn't a stated out-the-market goal, it's an internal one, but you have this vision of being at 9% SG&A margins by the end of 2012. There's a lot of room between the lip and the cup on that at this point.", "Robert Simpson", "Yes, there is, Michael. You're right. There's a of lot of work to do.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "I mean, you can't be just growing your way to that. This is something...", "Robert Simpson", "Michael, you got -- we did some analysis on that, and what we got to do -- we got to assume that our sales group, through their customer focus growth effort, will be able to grow revenue to keep their share of the costs down at a certain level that fits the 9% SG&A run rate going forward. We gotta assume our growth initiatives will do the same thing. And they've got plans that tell us that they're working on plans to get to that. On the G&A side, we've got to take a fair amount of costs out and you don't do that without the efforts we're going through right now.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "And then on the growth side, I mean you're losing money right now. I get it, you're investing, but you're losing money. You're losing money at a tune of -- depending on what your tax issue, something in the $75 million to $100 million a year. Are there revenues at this juncture offsetting that or is this all investing? I mean, serial revenues, not serious revenues, not a little bit of revenues.", "David Steiner", "Yes, I know there's revenue but not enough to offset it, right? I mean -- and so what you've got when you look at the two primary growth initiatives that we focus on, Bagster and medical waste, what you've got in Bagster is huge growth rates. I mean we grew the number of bags sold in March. There were about 24,000. That was over 100% increase from last year. The problem is that you've got to spend a lot of advertising dollars to get customer awareness. And that basically what drags down Bagster is the fact that you've got to get that customer awareness built up. As you build volume, obviously, that helps. And then as you get more market awareness, ultimately, you won't need to spend as much on marketing. And then on the medical waste side, the investments we've made have been mostly in building out infrastructure. And then once you build out infrastructure, you've got to add salespeople in order to go and get revenue. And it's a fairly long-cycle sale in the medical waste side. So both of those don't have enough revenue to offset those sort of start-up costs.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "Okay. And then 2 last questions. The last time gas prices got really high, you clearly had a compression on the consumer activity. What's your sort of feel about that? And admittedly, that was in the middle or at the start of the recession, but what do you feel about it today? We're on the backside of this recession, but gas prices are high.", "David Steiner", "Yes, it's interesting. You all see the headlines just like we see the headlines. I've been surprised that with gasoline prices as high as they are, there hasn't been as much talk about it. I mean, in other words, I think the last time it happened, there was the initial shock because it really hadn't happened before. And now I think people are pretty used to gasoline, whether $3 per gallon -- at $3 with it, right? And so obviously, I think all American businesses have to be concerned about high fuel applied prices dampening the economy. Frankly for us, I think there's sort of a sweet spot in there between roughly $3.50 a gallon of gasoline where frankly it's not so high that we can't recover it through our fuel surcharge and customers don't complain about that. Yet as we've talked about before, our smaller local competitors that don't have fuel surcharge are just going to have 1 choice or 2 choices: make less money or increase prices. That's a good thing. And then as the price of diesel goes up, if they're going to drive by our landfill, we basically price our landfill by figuring out what's the cost and the next best alternative. And all of sudden, the next best alternative becomes a lot more expensive at higher diesel prices. So I think you've hit the nail right on the head. My concern is not that it's going to impact our business because frankly I think the impact to our business are pretty good. My bigger concern would be that it would have an impact on the larger economy. And so far, I think people have been a little bit immune to the higher prices, let's hope it continues.", "Robert Simpson", "Our investment in the natural gas fleets, CNG have been helpful to us.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "Right. last question, rates are about as low as we're probably ever going to see in our lifetime again. Is there something you can or should be doing re the balance sheet that could just take advantage of driving your overall costs to your balance sheet down?", "David Steiner", "Hey, it's a wonderful idea. We've always -- we've put in some swaps this quarter to take advantage of it, about $600 million in notional value. And we'll continue to take a look at that. We aren't going to add that just because it's cheap. We need to have a reason to do it, but we certainly will look at it all the time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Fisher with Raymond James.", "William Fisher - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Actually just following up on the last question on the fuel-related thing and landfill pricing. I noticed your transfer station revenues have been weaker in some of the other lines. Is that partially just the longer-haul waste maybe staying closer to home and does that give an opportunity, as you think you've touched on to price up more of your in-town, if you will, landfills?", "David Steiner", "Yes, it's interesting that you say because I think you're absolutely right. We've seen the costs go up there. But for the first time in a long time, we've actually started to see some positive pricing at the transfer station level. So generally the transfer stations have almost been viewed as a pass-through. A couple of years ago, we got folks that focus on them as more of a cost center and a profit center, and I think you're seeing the results of that.", "William Fisher - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "I'm seeing pricing there. And then on the surcharge, you touched on that as well. I guess based on where fuel is now and be up another -- that your list surcharge, if you will, on collection would be up another couple of hundred basis points in Q2. And I know you've done a great job getting a surcharge through, but is there any pushback, say in commercial, on the acceptance of that? I mean, any churn related to that at all?", "David Steiner", "No. I mean, we have seen virtually no noise on pushbacks from the fuel surcharge. Now interestingly, one of the things we have seen is that some of our, both national and local, competitors have been out offering new business pricing with no fuel surcharge. I gotta tell you, that's going to be a tactic they're going to regret the next year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities.", "Albert Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc.", "I want to go back on the growth initiatives, and I think, David, what you said is you're counting on volume recovery to get the Bagster and medical waste to positive contribution, at least at the EPS line. But it appears that when you aggregate some of the macro comments that, that's more of a challenge than maybe it appears. Could you maybe just comment on what needs to happen for your forecast to be achieved?", "David Steiner", "Yes, on the Bagster side, I think you're right. You have to see activity. And one of the things that we saw when we first looked at this Bagster opportunity was with the new housing starts down, you're going to have more people doing remodeling, right? And so that's the perfect opportunity for Bagster. And so I'm not certain that Bagster is as much tied in to the overall economy as, for example, our typical roll-off hauls. Because as you see fewer people buying homes or constructing homes, your roll-off hauls go down. But what that means is that you've got to remodel your current home and that should drive Bagster sales up. On the medical waste side, it's not as tied to the economy, frankly, as it is tied to getting the salesforce in place and getting them through the long cycle of sales, right? In other words, you build infrastructure and so that costs you money and that has costs. And then you add salespeople and that add costs. And if your sales cycle is three to six months on the medical waste side, you're going to suffer those costs before you start seeing revenue. And so we've been adding salespeople. We continue to add salespeople in medical waste. We need to see them starting to generate enough revenue to pay for themselves, if you will, because of the long sales cycle in medical waste. That takes a little bit longer.", "Albert Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc.", "But are you seeing -- I mean there's six months basically left to really hit the number, I guess. But are you seeing the sales drive some incremental volume here on the medical waste side to support what is probably at least $0.01 or $0.02 of that growth initiative attributable to medical waste?", "David Steiner", "Yes, we just picked up a bunch of hospitals from a large hospital chain. That comes onboard in the first and through the second quarter. So that's going to add revenue. We've had quite a few successes on the medical waste side out in the West Coast and the East Coast and so -- but those are customers that were adding basically in the first and second quarters. So you've got -- you should have some additional revenue generation. Frankly, it's been a little bit slower than we expected because we've got a competitor out there that's pretty fierce in doing whatever they need to do to retain customers. But that, too, will pass, and we think that medical waste will be a great business for us. And then on Bagster, clearly what we've seen year-over-year is over 100% growth on sales and over 200% growth on pickups. And so we're pretty confident that we'll see improvement there. Now I will tell you that in my mind, the back half of the year is a heck of a lot more focused on the cost reduction initiatives than it is the growth initiatives. Remember what we said about the growth initiatives is that they're going to continue to be negative in the second and third quarter and sort of flat to maybe slightly positive in the fourth quarter. So we're not banking the back half of the year on our growth initiative. We're banking the back half of our year on the cost reduction initiatives.", "Albert Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc.", "Okay. To that point then, profit center versus cost center, when you look back a couple of quarters and including this quarter, Q4 may have been the exception of 2010. Your cost of goods, cost of sales rate of increase is greater than the revenue. And so while I know there's a lot of moving parts here, I'm wondering if you're moving fast enough on the cost side given what you've seen in the economy and helping that gross margin story.", "Robert Simpson", "Are we moving fast enough? We think so, and certainly what we're trying to do here. So I think that's purpose of the effort. You go back a couple of quarters and you could see the significant cost reductions that we've had on the operating side. And as David said, as time goes on, those get harder and harder to do and you need to find something new. So we're going through these cost reduction initiatives. And now we do think that it's time to do it.", "David Steiner", "And when you look at the fourth quarter and the first quarter, you've also got to recognize that we had sort of a mix issue, right? And when you look at this quarter, for example, on special waste only being positive roughly 3%, that's one of our highest margin businesses right there. And so -- and the same with the other landfill volumes in the commercial line of business. So you've got a little bit of mix that I think was driven more by weather. And so between that and what Bob talked about, I think you should see that normalize as we go through the seasonal uptick.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Barmore with First Analysis.", "Jerry Barmore", "I was hoping to get a little more detail on the redesigned fuel surcharge you mentioned in your opening remarks. Can you tell us a little bit about what that involves? Is that something that is currently fully implemented or is it being phased in over time? And as you look ahead to future quarters, would you expect to be as effective in offsetting any spikes in diesel costs as it was in Q1?", "David Steiner", "We redesigned it mid-year last year, so it's fully rolled out. And all we did was -- in the redesign, was make sure we got better coverage as fuel prices went up, so our surcharge followed more quickly. And so it's working. It's working just the way we expected it to the way we redesigned it. And I expect that as fuel prices adjust throughout the rest of the year, it will adjust as quickly.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. Are there any closing remarks?", "David Steiner", "No. Thank you all for joining us. We think we had a very solid start to the year. We expect that to continue into the second quarter, obviously, with acceleration in the back half of the year. I'm very confident that we've got the right people in place and the right ideas in place to see that happen. So we look forward to the rest of 2011.", "Operator", "Thank you for participating in today's Waste Management First Quarter 2011 Earnings Release Conference.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the express written consent of Waste Management is prohibited.", "Now, I will turn the call over to Waste Management's CEO, David Steiner.", "David Steiner", "Thanks, Greg. Good morning from Houston. I'll begin by summarizing our quarterly results and will then review our pricing and volume performance in the second quarter. I'll close by updating you on our expectations for the remainder of the year. I am pleased to say that we again accomplished our primarily financial goals of earnings growth, margin expansion, and strong free cash flow generation that we can return to our shareholders. This strong performance shows, that our strategy of executing our disciplined pricing program along with operational improvements continues to be the right approach. We are in $0.56 per diluted share in the second quarter, this is an increase of $0.11 per share or over 24% when compared with our second quarter 2006 earnings.", "Income from operations as a percent of revenue increased by 210 basis point to 17.9%, and we produce $475 million in free cash flow in the quarter, bringing out free cash flow in the quarter -- bringing out free cash flow for the first half of the year to over $800 million.", "Revenue growth from yields is again a key driver behind our strong results this quarter. We generated waste business revenue growth from yield of 3.4%. If we include the 2.2% benefit from higher recycling commodity prices yield increase a total of 5.6%. And total revenue growth from yield increased across all four of our geographic operating groups and in our Wheelabrator and Recycle America units.", "The largest contribution to our internal revenue growth from yield was again from our collection business. Combined, the revenue growth from yield in the industrial, commercial and residential line of our collection business was 4.6% this quarter.", "Pricing in the commercial collection line of business lead the way with internal revenue growth from yield reaching 5.7% in the second quarter of this year, which is the highest level we have achieved dating back to at least 2002.", "Pricing is also stronger for the residential and rolloff lines of our collection business. In our rolloff line yield was up 4.3% despite volumes being down over 8%.", "This shows our disciplined approach to pricing despite the downturn in rolloff volumes and more importantly even with volumes down over 8% EBIT dollars were up in the rolloff line of business. So the price volume tradeoff continues to be positive.", "Finally, an increase in our environmental fee from 2% to 3% also contributed to the higher yield in our collection line of business.", "In total, revenue growth from yield and are landfills and transfer station also improved in the second quarter of 2007, and we expect that to continue as we began to see more benefits from our Disposal Pricing Excellence program.", "The pricing on MSW volumes coming into our landfills continues to grow. On a per ton basis, pricing on the MSW ton progressively increased over the last several years. The percentage increases in price are comparable to the percentage price increases we\u2019re achieving in our collection line of business.", "Revenue was down $52 million in the second quarter of this year and we continue to execute our strategy to divest underperforming operation and to price increase or divest underperforming accounts in our three collection lines of business. Second quarter revenues would have actually increased $52 million or about 1.5% compared with the prior year, if you adjust for the $104 million in divested revenue.", "Turning to the volume component of our internal revenue growth, we saw an overall decline in IRG from volumes of 4.4% in the second quarter of this year. In total, revenue growth from volume and our collection line business declined 4.8% in the second quarter of 2007. The volume loss in the collection side of the business is a combination of our pricing strategy and a continued softness in rolloff hauls related to economic condition. We can\u2019t control the economy, but we can control our pricing strategy and it's working.", "Our strategy remains to price our services to fully recover our cost, to expand our operating margins and to generate adequate returns in our investments. In doing so, we\u2019ve targeted unprofitable and low-margin business. Where we have lost volumes, we\u2019ve focused on flexing down our operating cost. The net result is higher income from operations and significant margin expansion in our collection line of business.", "Income from operation\u2019s dollars from our collection business grew by 20% in the second quarter of this year compared with the same period of 2006. And our income from operations margin in our collection business expanded by nearly 400 basis points. We are achieving growth in income from operations and margin across all three lines of our collection business, again, despite lower volumes.", "This again confirms what we\u2019ve have stated for some time, that not all collection volume is good volume, particularly if the revenue from that volume doesn't even cover the cost of disposal.", "When you can shed those volumes and flex costs down, EBIT dollars, EBIT margins and Return on Capital all grow. That\u2019s exactly what we did with our collection business again in the second quarter, growing EBIT dollars by 20% and we'll maintain that focus going forward.", "And our landfills, our internal revenue growth from volumes was a negative 4.4% during the second quarter of 2007. External volumes coming into our landfill showed steady seasonal improvement during the quarter, but on a year-over-year basis volumes were still lower than the volumes we saw in the second quarter of 2006.", "The decline in internal revenue growth due to lower MSW volumes was negative 2% and was primarily due to the closure of our service hill landfill in the Chicago area at the end of 2006, and our Bradley landfill in Los Angeles, in April of this year. Without those events volumes would have been flat in the MSW line.", "In light of the lower landfill volumes received this quarter, our financial performance was quie impressive and again demonstrates the quality of our pricing and operating costs program in our collection line of business. Our strong first half results along with our expectations for the last two quarters of the year let us to update our earnings outlook for the full year of 2007. We now expect our full year 2007 earnings to be within a range of $2.7 to $2.11 per diluted share, excluding certain items as noted in our press release press release today..", "If we look ahead for the remainder of 2007, we assume the economy in the second half of the year will be similar to the first half of the year. We certainly expect our earnings growth will continue to be driven by our pricing efforts and our shedding of unprofitable and low margin collection volumes, and we expect continued to improve our operating cost structure. Our result from the last few years clearly shows that our strategy is working. Quarter after quarter we continue to show significant earnings and margin expansion driven by the sustainability of our pricing excellence program. We certainly expect that trend be continued near future and stronger and expected landfill volumes and rolloff holds would only accelerate that growth.", "The success behind our strategy is due to the quality of our waste management employees who were responsible for developing and executing the strategy. I believe that this is the best group of people on the industry, and that they will maintain the level of achievement necessary to accomplish our goals for the remained or the year. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Larry.", "Larry O'Donnell", "Thank you, David, and good morning. I'll begin by reviewing our operating cost results for the quarter. I am very pleased with the continued success of our operational excellences initiative. During the second quarter of 2007, we again reduced our operating expenses when compared with the prior year quarter. Operating expenses in the second quarter of 2007 were $2.92 billion or $107 million lower than in the second quarter 2006. This is a 4.9% improvement and marks the fourth consecutive quarter in which we've reduced year-over-year operating cost on an absolute dollar basis.", "As we have seen for sometime, a number of factors contributed to the reduction in cost this quarter. These included our success in flexing down our operations as we shed volumes due to our pricing efforts and the ongoing divestiture of non-strategic operations. Also, we continue to see a positive impact from our operational excellence initiatives, particularly in the area of safety.", "As a percent of revenue, operating expenses improved to 62.3% in the second quarter 2007 compared with 64.5% in the second quarter of 2006. This 220 basis point improvement marks the eighth consecutive quarter in which our year-over-year results have improved on a percent of revenue basis, due to the combination of our pricing and operational excellence initiatives.", "I will now review our performance in a number of cost categories using basis point changes as a percent of revenue in my explanation.", "As a percent of revenue, we reduced labor and related benefits cost by about 50 basis points. On an absolute dollar basis, we lowered our labor and related benefits cost by $26 millions compared with the second quarter of 2006. We achieved the most significant savings in the areas of overtime expense, hourly wages, and contract labor which indicates that we are successfully managing our workforce and flexing down costs, as we have reduced volumes. Improved efficiencies in all three of our collection lines of business also contributed to the reduction in cost.", "We lowered our maintenance cost by about 40 basis points in the quarter. I am pleased with this result considering that we estimate the annual inflation rate on our maintenance cost to be about 4% to 5%. We continue to utilize our Compass Maintenance Information System along with our standardization of best practices and tools to lower our fleet maintenance cost as we reduced driver hours. Our field mangers continue to use the better information available to them to maximize vehicle utilization leading to the retirement of the excess vehicles and the identification of the highest cost vehicles that we can target for replacement.", "Risk management cost as a percent of revenue, improved by over 70 basis points. Once again, this was driven by lower workers compensation cost and a reduction in auto and general liability claim expenses. Our safety performance as measured by a total recordable injury rate and OSHA safety measure continues to improve. We lowered our TRIR year-over-year for the 26th consecutive quarter. For the second quarter of 2007, we improved our TRIR performance to 4.5, which is over a 9% reduction compared with the second quarter of 2006.", "There is nothing I am more proud of than the progress we have made in safety. Safety is the core value for us here at Waste Management, and our people's dedication to safety continues to give us what we believe to be industry leading results. The progress we are making in safety is translating the bottom line savings. We reduced our total risk management cost by $25 million in the second quarter of 2007 compared to the same period in 2006, over half of which is due to the reduction of actuarial projections to claim losses.", "Subcontractor costs improved by over 50 basis points in the quarter, as we utilized fewer third party contractors due to lower volumes and divestitures. Lower direct diesel fuel cost translated into about a 25 basis points improvement in our operating expense as a percent of revenue. This was caused primarily by the decline in our overall fuel consumption due to the reduction in our collection volumes. The impact of the change in diesel fuel prices was minimal as they were relatively flat between periods.", "Transfer and disposal expenses improved by 80 basis points during the second quarter of 2007. Our focus on exiting low margin collection businesses where we don't internalize the volume contributed to the improvement. One significant head win on our operating cost in the quarter was the cost of goods sold, which increased by over a 130 basis points during the second quarter of 2007 due to higher recycling commodity prices in the higher rebates we paid to our customers.", "In the other cost category, we lowered operating expenses as a percent of revenue by over 30 basis points in the second quarter of this year. You may recall that in the second quarter of 2006 cost relating primarily to a strike in New York City increased operating expenses by about $11 million, $8 million of that amount go in to this cost category in 2006, the assets of which largely explains the year-over-year improvement in this years quarter.", "Many of you have read recent news accounts about our union contract negotiation in our early July lockout of approximately 500 workers in the Auckland, California area. I\u2019m pleased to report that we reached an agreement with the union last Thursday July 26, and our union employees have returned to work. This labor disruption had no material impact on second quarter 2007 results. We do expect it to have a financial impact on third quarter 2007 results and we will inform you about that in our third quarter conference call.", "In all of our labor union negotiations, we have a primary objective to ensure that we treat all of our employee, both union and non-union in a fair and equitable manner. This includes offering competitive wages and benefits and safe working conditions to each and every employee within Waste Management. Before the lockout, we had certain goals for the Auckland collective bargaining agreement. We achieved all of our goals through the lockout. And our union employees clearly found a new agreement to be fair as they overwhelmingly approved the new agreement on Saturday.", "I\u2019m proud of the efforts of our Green Team and other Waste Management replacement workers who were some of the best drivers, mechanics, and route managers we have in the company; along with the outstanding efforts of our local team on the West Coast; the Call Center Employees around the country, who handle calls for Auckland; and others within Waste Management, who helped us during the duration of the labor disruption.", "As I stated at the beginning of my remarks, the second quarter marks the eighth straight quarter in which the combination of our pricing in operational excellence initiatives have enabled us to reduce year-over-year operating expenses as a percent of revenue. An overall cost decrease of 4.9% on an absolute dollar basis is our best performance in a number of years. I'm pleased that we have continued to make improvements to our various initiatives, in spite of inflationary pressures. This demonstrates to me, that our team is focused on the right things, and we remained committed to showing sustained improvements.", "With that, I'll turn the call over the Bob.", "Bob Simpson", "Thank you, Larry. I will start with a review of SG&A costs of the second quarter of 2007. SG&A expenses were 10.2% of revenue during the second quarter of 2007, which was better than our expectations. Our year-over-year costs increased $15 million to $343 million in the second quarter of 2007. The primary drivers of the year-over-year increases were annual salary merit increases and the implementation costs of our strategic initiatives including the SAP revenue management system. Depreciation and amortization expense of the second quarter of 2007 was down $23 million when compared with the second quarter of 2006. This year-over-year declines due to the impacts of lower landfill volumes, divestitures, and reduced depreciation expense as we have fully depreciated in information technology system. As the percent of revenue, depreciation and amortization expense was 9.6% compared with 10.1% in the prior year quarter.", "Moving down the income statement, income from the gains and divestitures totaled $33 million during the second quarter of 2007. During the second 2007, we divested operations with annualized revenues of $172 million. Interest expense was $132 million in the second quarter of this year a $6 million decrease from the same period of 2006.", "This decrease is due primarily to the $351 million decrease in total reported debt compared with the second quarter of 2006. Our debt to total capital ratio decreased to 57.6% in line with our objective to be at or below 60% and largely unchanged from last years second quarter.", "The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio stood at 37% at the end of the quarter. Interest income decreased from $20 million to $11 million for the second quarter of 2007 due to the expected reduction in cash balances and short-term investments with a lower interest income related to a second quarter 2006 income tax audit settlement.", "I now want to take a few moments to discuss several income tax related matters. After adjusting for the tax related benefits that we noted in today\u2019s press release, our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 34% which reflect a 29% phase out of our Section 45K tax credit.", "This phase out percentage is based on our estimated at June 30 of the average crude oil price for the full year related to that phase out percentage the expenses associated with our two synthetic fuel investments. These are included on the line items entitled equity in net losses of unconsolidated entities\" which totaled $22 million for the second quarter of 2007. For the third quarter of 2007, we currently project a benefit of $0.02 per diluted share related to our Section 45 K tax credits and the operations of the two synthetic fuel plants. At the projected phase out level of 29%, we expect a full year 2007 effective tax rate of 34%, and a benefit from Section 45 K tax credits of $0.09 per diluted share for the full year 2007 down from $0.11 had there been no phase out of the credits. ", " Regarding 2008 expectations, section 45 K tax credits and the related EPS benefit go away at the end of 2007. Consequently, we expect our 2008 effective tax rate to increase to approximately 40%. Also in 2008, the income statement line titled Equity and Net Losses of Unconsolidated Entities will not include any ongoing costs relating to the investments in the two synthetic fuel plants, which account for virtually all of the dollars in the line item. So in 2008, there will not be any earnings per share benefit from Section 45 K tax credits. ", " We generated $537 million in net cash from operations during the second quarter of 2007, a decline of $20 million when compared with the second quarter of 2006. The drop in net cash from operations resulted primarily from higher income tax payments in the second quarter of 2007 and unfavorable changes in working capital due to the timing of payments. These items were offset in part by a $45 million increase in Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization. ", " Capital expenditures were recorded at $209 million, adding in the $147 million in proceeds from divestitures and other asset sales, our free cash flow was $475 million in the second quarter of 2007. That brings our free cash flow for the first half of 2007 to $810 million. As noted in the press release we now expect a need or exceed our previously projected free cash flow range of 1.3 to $1.4 billion for the full year 2007.", "During the second quarter we utilized our free cash flow and available cash to repurchase approximately 5.5 million shares for $196 million. We also paid $125 million in cash dividend during the second quarter of 2007. We are very pleased with the first half of the year. As David and Larry indicated, we will continue to pursue our pricing and operational strategy which we expect will lead to the improved financial performance we outlined for the full year of 2007. And with that operator, let's open the lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Jagdeep Ghuman with Credit Suisse.", "Jagdeep Ghuman - Credit Suisse", "Good Morning.", "David Steiner", "Good morning.", "Larry O'Donnell", "How are you?", "Jagdeep Ghuman - Credit Suisse", "No not too bad, a good quarter, just had a couple of questions here. One, can you give us an update on the progress in terms of your account by account review on your commercial accounts, where do you stand there, and at what point you are going to start pushing pricing even more so on that end.", "David Steiner", "Yeah, there is really two bases to it. First, we go out and we audit those customers as we\u2019ve talked about before of our auditor checking waste and time to the service, and then we pass those costs on to our sales department who then goes out and talks with the customers about our underperforming customers. So there is two pieces to it. The second piece which is fastened on to the sales folks also has two pieces to it. There are customers that we go out and we immediately talk to, and there are customers like national account or regional accounts where we\u2019ve got get through all of the locations before we go and talk to them.", "So, having said all that we\u2019ve been through about 350,000 customers so far. We found very consistently that about 15% to 20 % of those customers are under water. Other customers that we\u2019ve passed over to our sales department, the average price increase has between 25% to 30%. So it continues to work very well. We expect it to continue to provide benefits to our year throughout 2007-2008.", "Jagdeep Ghuman - Credit Suisse", "Got you. Okay. Fair enough. Also, can you provide a progress update on your divestitures you have outlined as far as asset up for sale, kind of, how much is left, what kind of progress are you are seeing there?", "David Steiner", "We mentioned a couple of quarters ago that we no longer are going to look upon that as a program, we are just going to continue with our normal course of our business to sell our underperforming businesses that we think that\u2019s the right course of action. I won\u2019t tell you though that the original program we have sold well over half of the amount we originally identified, and we still have others that we will sell as the opportunity presents itself.", "Jagdeep Ghuman - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Fair enough. And just one final question with regards to your free cash flow guidance, what kind of uses for this cash are you seeing in regards to share repurchase or dividend increase. Just kind of how do you rank order these things in terms of priority?", "Bob Simpson", "We have authority from our Board of Directors to spend $600 million in excess of what we guided at the beginning of the year. We still have much of that authority available, we haven\u2019t used it yet, and would clearly expect to get into that as the year goes on. With respect to other opportunities, if there is a wonderful acquisition of a landfill, close-in landfill in and intercity area. We\u2019d love to buy it, actually many of those. But since the opportunity presents itself, we would certainly move for that.", "Jagdeep Ghuman - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Fair enough. Thank you very much. Great quarter.", "Bob Simpson", "Thank you.", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ellis with Merrill Lynch.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Great, thanks. Good morning guys.", "David Steiner", "Good morning Jonathan.", "Hoping you could talk a little bit about landfill volumes, you did walk through the change year-over-year on the MSW side. I'm wondering if you could speak to landfill volumes within C&D and also Special Waste.", "David Steiner", "Sure. When you look at -- we talk about Special Waste quite often that Special Waste jobs can be lumpy. What we saw this quarter is that if you exclude the hurricane volumes from last years Special Waste was basically flat. Now, flat Special Waste volumes are down a little bit from what we saw on the previous quarters, but still flat. On a C&D line, what we saw was that C&D continue to be negative, negative in the 20% to 25% range like it has been since the slowdown in the housing starts. So, basically what we saw during the quarter was the normal seasonal upturn, the volumes didn\u2019t get back to the rate that they were at in 2006. Remember 2006, we had some great volumes in the first half of the year, and so, what we saw were volumes that we think have stabilized, we think that obviously the second half of the year has easier comps. And with respect to the dramatic drop off in C&D volumes that really only account for about 2% of our revenues. So it doesn\u2019t have a dramatic effect on earnings on the bottom line. So, I guess the long and the short of this, that we saw volumes through this normal seasonal upturn. We saw them stabilize through the quarter, and we would expect to see that same performance in the second half of the year.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Great. And then just, turning your attention to the pricing side, I am wondering if you can talk a little bit about pricing trends both in terms of gate rates versus contracts pricing? And also within the context of contract pricing, I am curious, if you are looking at shortening any of your contract durations or strategically how you are approaching your landfill contracts now?", "David Steiner", "Yeah. When you look at \u2013 we talked about it a lot, that about 70% to 75% of the volumes at the landfill are contracted volumes. Now, again, there is two pieces to that too. There are pieces where you don\u2019t really have much of a same duration of the contract. When a big bid comes up from a municipality, there are going to dictate what the length of the contract is, and so you are not going to play with that.", "Frankly, on the non-municipal contracts basically, third party haulers, we are going to do what's right for our business, whether it's a one year contract, a two year contract or a three contract. We are going to make a decision that is based on return on invested capital. If we can get a high enough price, and lock it in for a period where we get good price increases through the term of the contract, I don\u2019t see why we would want to lock in to a one year contract. When you are the price leader, you want to stay the price leader, and if you can get a contract that keeps you as the price leader, I don\u2019t know why we wouldn\u2019t do that.", "Now, at the gate, what we have seen is that the prices at the landfill have basically come up to the same type of levels, and in some cases exceeded the levels of our collection pricing program. So, we are very happy to say that disposal pricing excellence is working. And again, we except to see continued benefits out of that through 2007 and 2008.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Great. And just a final question from me, in terms of capital spending, it looks like you lowered the high-end of your guidance from $1.3 billion to $1.35 billion, according to the press release. I'm wondering if you could talk about what precipitated that.", "David Steiner", "Well, I don\u2019t think we did that at all. I think what we said was that we expect to meet or exceed our free cash flow guidance for the year.", "Bob Simpson", "Yes, I think our guidance initially was $1.3 to $1.4, and\u2026", "David Steiner", "Correct.", "Bob Simpson", "And we think we'll need to get that.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. I'm sorry. I was comparing the 2Q outside of 1Q press release to the 2Q press release.", "Bob Simpson", "Okay.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you.", "David Steiner", "Certainly, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Corey Greendale with First Analysis.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "Hi, good morning.", "David Steiner", "Good morning.", "Bob Simpson", "Good morning.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "On the landfill pricing, can you talk about what you are seeing from competitors as you raise price, are they going along with you or not?", "David Steiner", "Well, you have to break it down into the various segments. It's interesting at the Special Waste line, and again, Special Waste jobs can be as a huge mix component to Special Waste, unlike some of the other line items, but we've seen great price increases on our side of the table in Special Waste quite frankly that\u2019s why we lost volume in the quarter. What we saw was some big jobs that came up, where folks were bidding high low single -- a low single-digit or low double-digit pricing and we are just not going to go there from a Special Waste point of view. So, on Special Waste, I think the competitive arena is still very active and you haven\u2019t seen a lot of price movement on Special Waste. You've seen more on C&D and MSW, again its -- we've talked about it now for 18 months, it's spotty, you see some places where folks are reacting, such that you know that they are taking into account return on invested capital. They are understanding that you'll never be able to sell that landfill ton again and if you can hold on to it, it's going to be worth more in the future. We are starting to see people understand that, but then you'll see some places where it\u2019s a little bit spotty. We've talked about it before, that mostly places like the Midwest?", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "Okay. For Bob, could you share any thoughts, are you willing to share any thoughts on where SG&A and D&A come in for the full year, as a percent of revenue?", "Bob Simpson", "Well, I don't think we are going to change our view on the SG&A for the year, we've said it would be a little bit above 10.5% and I don't think that will change. I know there are some tiny issues here on some of the SG&A spending, if that does change we certainly can talk about it in the future. We expect D&A to be down comparable to what it was this time for the full year as a percent of revenue basis, it may be a little bit higher.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "Okay, and is there anything \u2013 we're going to just look in at that historical seasonality on the gross margin line, any reason to think that historical trends aren\u2019t pretty indicative of what you will see this year?", "Bob Simpson", "I can't imagine, why you see any change in the pattern.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "Okay. And then my other question is just any revised thoughts on CapEx with volumes down or you\u2019re certainly going to be lost about now what do you suggest that at the beginning of the year?", "Bob Simpson", "Yeah, I think that we haven\u2019t updated that guidance. I think at the beginning of the year, we said $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion and I think, we will see in fact we have curtailed some of our container purchasing with the volume declines. But we haven\u2019t updated that range, I would expect to be, still some more part in that range, that will be a little below it.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "Thank you.", "Bob Simpson", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line Scott Levine with J.P. Morgan.", "Scott Levine - J.P. Morgan", "Good morning.", "Bob Simpson", "Good morning, Scott.", "David Steiner", "Good morning.", "Scott Levine - J.P. Morgan", "Regarding volumes, I saw a little bit of improvement here Q1 to Q2. I'm wondering if you could just discuss your thoughts on the macro landscape and how that trend is coming in relative to your expectations and what your thoughts, in particular, are on the roll off segment of the business as we move into the back half of year?", "Larry O'Donnell", "Yeah, I think it's safe to say that at the macro level member at the beginning of the year, we talked about as far as seeing in sort of a back half weighted year. I think it's safe to say that frankly their volumes have not been as robust as we expected them to be when we looked at the beginning of the year.", "Frankly, our operational improvements and our pricing programs have made for that decrease in volume, and so when you are growing EBIT dollars on the collection line by 15% to 20% that can make up for a little bit of softness in the landfill volumes and that\u2019s exactly what we have seen, that\u2019s why we say if we see landfill volumes that roll off pulls bounce back in the second half of the year there is going to be some upside to our guidance.", "Now, on the roll off line I think it\u2019s safe to say remember in the first quarter roll off pulls were down over 9%, second quarter they were down 8%, the comps gets easier in the back of the year. So we would expect the pulls to stabilize, what think we've seen is that we've seen some stabilization, its going to be a U shaped recovery I think in the housing sector, its not going to be V shaped recovery but what we have seen is the bottom of that curve we believe so that we are going to see stabilizing volumes which obviously will look better in the second half of the year cause the comps will be easier", "Scott Levine - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, turning to price could you talk a little bit about how the other retention rates are looking on your collection business and how they are coming in relative to your expectation say at the beginning of the year as well?", "Larry O'Donnell", "Yeah, our churn rates stays at about the 9.3% level again which is well below where we've been historically in the past and that\u2019s about what we expected at the beginning of the year. Now again when we expected that 9% to 9.5% range at beginning of the year that wasn\u2019t taken into account that we were going to be shedding a lot of customers intentionally through our business improvement process. And so, frankly, I think it\u2019s a great performance on the retention side given that we are voluntarily asking, when I talked about that business improvement process the one thing I've failed to mention was that, for those customers where we are asking for pricing increases on average 25% to 30%. When we are asking for those price increases, about 85% of those customers are sticking with us, about 15% are leaving. So, given that, I think the 9.3% churn rate is quite an accomplishment.", "Scott Levine - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. One last one on costs, are there any areas that you would point to your dollar savings on a year-over-year basis are increasing last couple of quarters. Are there any areas you\u2019d point us to, as you see it as the greatest sources of further improvement over the next few quarters?", "Larry O'Donnell", "We are going to just keep focusing on the initiatives that we have had going here for a while everything from safety. Safety continues to give us some great results and it has the added benefit of making it a safer place to work and a safer place for our communities. So we are continuing to see the improvements there. When you look at productivity, which we now call efficiency, I think there is still opportunity there. That\u2019s a part of what we get of our business improvement process. It's not only about pricing, it's also about finding ways to run more efficiently, and I think we will continue to see opportunities there.", "And maintenance is another area that we have been focused on for a while. We now have information that our maintenance technicians have available to them and that is certainly helping drive our improvements. So those are the areas that we\u2019ll continue to focus on. I think there is still opportunity in each one of those areas to help us further improve our costs.", "Scott Levine - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. One quick add on. I know you didn\u2019t quantify the strike related costs in Q3, but you had a strike in the second quarter in New York and D.C. Can we use that as a rough approximation in terms of the duration and the number of people to kind of estimate what the expected cost might be here for the bearer?", "Larry O'Donnell", "We are just, the lockout just ended this week and we are just talking beginning to get the bills in from some of the cost impact and some of the replacement workers just started going home on Sunday. So, it's really too early for us to be able to give you a good number on what that number is expected to be. That is certainly something we\u2019ll cover in our third quarter call.", "But we had a lot of people out there, I mean, this was a big event, big labor disruption for us, lot bigger than anyone that we have had before. And I suspect that the expense is going to be higher than what we saw in other locations, but I won't know that, none of us will know that until we start pulling together the costs as they start coming in.", "Scott Levine - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Fisher with Raymond James", "Bill Fisher-Raymond James", "Good morning.", "David Steiner", "Good morning, Bill.", "Larry O'Donnell", "Good morning, Bill.", "Bill Fisher-Raymond James", "Yeah, couple of things. First, if you look at the mix of your higher margin commercial collection versus lower margin industrial rolloff side, with all that divestitures and volume changes, do you see a mix move towards the commercial side, a higher mix of that, and where I am going with that is, do you also see the more volatile temporary rolloff side is really shrinking as a percentage of total from where you where, say last year?", "David Steiner ", " Yeah, I mean clearly when you got 8% this quarter, 9% last quarter, when you got that kind of volume loss in the industrial side, again mostly temporary rolloff, certainly you will see a slight makeshift. It\u2019s like when we started calling out to unprofitable residential contracts, we saw a slight mixed shift there.", "But Bill, again, when I look at the collection line of business I like to look at bottom line EBIT dollars because whether we make an EBIT dollar at a great margin on the residential line or commercial line of the rolloff line, it's all about dropping more EBIT dollars to the bottom line, and we were very pleased again this quarter to see those EBITD dollars grow by 20%.", "Bill Fisher-Raymond James", "Okay. Great. And just following up on the pricing you mentioned earlier on, I think it was 350,000 customers you had targeted on the one initiative, can you just remind us how many total customers you have or how far you are on that part of pricing?", "David Steiner", "We are about 50% grew on the audit side, but again you got to remember that when you are 50% though on the audit side, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve touched 50% of the customers because a number of those customers impact -- a good number of those customers have to be deferred until you cover all of their locations. So if you have a regional or a logo or a national customer you got to get load allocation before you go to talk to the customer. So the fact that we\u2019ve been through 50% of the audit does not mean that we have been 50% of the customers to seek a price increase.", "Bill Fisher-Raymond James", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Leone Young with Citigroup.", "Leone Young - Citigroup", "Yes, good morning.", "David Steiner", "Good morning.", "Larry O'Donnell", "Good morning.", "Leone Young - Citigroup", "Two things I, to the extent you can talk about it Larry, you mentioned that did achieve several goals about Larry you mentioned that you did achieve several goals with the lockout, could you be a little more specific and possibly whether they have positive or a negative ramifications of your settlements and upcoming labor negotiations?", "David Steiner", "Sure, I would be happy to. We really had a unusual agreement in Oakland, In fact, I would say the agreement that we had previously in Oakland was unlike any other union contract that certainly I am aware of and not been told probably anywhere in any industry. One of our goals was about safety. As you heard us talk for a long time we were serious about improving the safety for our employees as well as the communities we serve, and it is been for a along time our goal to be become world class in safety. When you look at our Oakland operations, as it turns out, they actually have the world safety record of anywhere in our company. I will just give you a couple of examples.", "Number one, the driver infinite rate is about 200 times -- 200% higher than our company average. And when you look at the number of drivers that have been involved in multiple accidents, they are about 310% above the company average. In the prior collective bargaining agreement we had, with the theme has really prevented us from being able to implement effectively the waste management safety program that would put in everywhere else, and off course you heard me report on the dramatic improvement that we had everywhere else.", "With a successful program, but unfortunately, we were not able to implement it effectively given the agreement that we had, previously their other collective bargaining agreement that we had in Oakland. So, we really, that was a focus for. We wanted to make sure that we were able to provide a safe environment for our employees, as well as, for our community. That\u2019s what our safety program is all about, and so it was very important and it was a top priority for us to be able to get the appropriate safety rules in the collective bargaining agreement, so we could began to see the improvement in Oakland that we have seen everywhere else. So that was goal number one and we were successful in getting that type of language in the agreement.", "Number two. In this, was what was very unusual, I am not aware of this language being in any other collective bargaining agreement anywhere. They essentially had the right to go on strike anytime they want it, for whatever the reason they want it, anytime and they could actually use that as a threat, and they had used it as a threat when we're having negotiations with other unions in other cities, it would come up that Oakland was going to go out on strike and support it, if we didn\u2019t agreed to various terms. So, we constantly had that threat hanging over our head. What you find, it's very standard language and typical, collective bargaining agreement is a provision that says, during the term of the agreement, the company won't lock out the employees, and the employees won\u2019t strike. If you have any disagreement, there is a process, usually some form of binding arbitration or something like that. We did not have that language previously in that agreement, very, very unusual. That was important to us to get that standard type language in our agreement, so that we could ensure that we would have labor peace throughout the term of the agreement, and not constantly suffer the threats of disrupted service to our Oakland customers there. So, that was important to us, and we were able to get that language that we wanted in the agreement. So we are very pleased with that. Those we\u2019re two primary objectives, which we were able to achieve. That -- and another reason we ended up coming up with a lock -- having to lock out the employees, it was clear to us, what they were going to try to do. They had refused to negotiate at all with us, and it appeared to us that they were trying to delay negotiations. They didn\u2019t get it lined up in time with the negotiation that we were going to then have in Los Angeles. We have that contract -- union contract will expire at the end of September. And we just felt it important to deal with Oakland on its own, separately, while we could cover the [routes] and make sure we were able to continue to provide service to the Oakland customers and deal with that, and not have it line up with the exploration of the Los Angeles contract.", "Leone Young - Citigroup", "Terrific. And, just my second question. Could you get an update on your SAP implementation?", "Bob Simpson", "Yes. Leone, the pilot into Mexico continues, and we've learnt a lot from it. It's now in the process of not only continuing that pilot but also taking the learning from that pilot and working with SAP to enhance the program to cover needs that we've identified that we didn\u2019t understand until we went through the pilot. So, I think that it's moving along as -- perhaps not as fast as we would like but it's moving along quite well, and I think we expect we do believe we have an excellent product by the time we finish implementing, the recall for solution review. I think we are moving along just fine.", "Leone Young - Citigroup", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Brian Butler with FBR.", "Brian Butler - FBR", "Good morning.", "Bob Simpson", "Good morning.", "David Steiner", "Good morning, Brian.", "Brian Butler - FBR", "Just two quick ones, on new business pricing, could you just comment a little bit on the trend there and how that\u2019s comparing to your current pricing? Is it moderated? I mean is the spread between the two widening?", "Bob Simpson", "Yes, remember Brian, when we started the pricing program, 18 months or two years ago, we were seeing new business pricing, that\u2019s exactly where we focus, is our new business pricing, and we were seeing new business pricing in the range of 10 to 20% when we originally started the pricing program. Now, obviously you are not going to see that kind of increase year-over-year, you saw it earlier on. So, it has moderated, its moderated into the high single-digits on new business pricing, but one of the things that we always look at and we talked about it before, it happened first in second quarter of 2006, which is that the average price at which we're selling new business, and so if you selling new business at $5 a yard, the average price at which we are selling new business is higher than the average price at which we're losing new business. And so, if you are selling new business at $5 yard, you're losing it at $4.60 a yard, obviously you get some great earnings benefit from that. And so, we've seen that, we saw that flip second quarter of 2006. We still continue to see that in both the commercial and the industrial lines of business, and so, I think you've hit the nail on the head, new business pricing is absolutely a focus ours, and we continue to see robust increases in the new business pricing.", "Brian Butler - FBR", "Okay, great. And last question, just when you think about this pricing strategy, I mean its not working great as you said for the last 18 months, you've seen very -- very good margin improvement. Over the next, lets say 18 to 24 months, how much more margin improvement is reasonable, I guess? Is there any expectation there?", "David Steiner", "We haven't talked about the particular margin improvement, but certainly, if we can get price increases that are in the range of a 100 basis points above CPI, and if we ultimately see the volumes moderate, such that we're not losing volumes, we are getting our bear share of volumes from GDP growth, and certainly you should expect to continue to see triple-digit margin expansion from us.", "Brian Butler - FBR", "Great, thank you very much", "Bob Simpson", "Thank you.", "David Steiner", "Thanks Brian.", "David Steiner", "In summary, we once again had another great quarter here at Waste Management. We are very pleased by the price volume trade-off, and Brian, I think hit the nail on the head in the last question, which is 18 months to two years ago, everybody wondered, when we started the pricing program, is it going to be sustainable? I think what we've shown over the last two years is that the pricing program is sustainable, we absolutely expected to continue on in the future and we absolutely continue to expect to meet our three primary goals of growing earnings, growing margins, and growing free cash flow that we return to share holders. And with that operator, we\u2019ll say thank you and we\u2019ll see you all again next quarter.", "Operator", "Thank for participating in today\u2019s Waste Management second quarter 2007 earnings release conference call.

Now, I will turn the call over to Waste Management's, CEO, David Steiner.", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Greg, and good morning. The first quarter was a strong one for Waste Management, and we once again achieved our primary financial goals of growing earnings, expanding operating margins, and generating strong free cash flow to return to our shareholders. We accomplish these financial goals despite the headwinds of rising diesel fuel prices, a U.S economic environment that was more challenging than it was at any time during 2007, and severe winter weather in the Mid West. We achieved our financial objectives by consistently following or strategy of disciplined pricing combined with cost control through operational improvements. It's an approach that's worked in the past and we intend to maintain it. And even in a challenging economic environment we believe our strategy will help us to meet our full year earnings and free cash flow projections.", "After adjusting for the items that we noted in today's press release we earned $0.47 per diluted share in this year's first quarter which is an increase of $0.04 per share or over 9% compared with the first quarter of 2007. Our results in the first quarter 2007 included a $0.02 per diluted share benefit from Section 45K tax credits. Without that benefit 2007 first quarter earnings would have been $0.41 per diluted share. On that basis year-over-year earnings would have grown $0.06 per diluted share over 14% in the first quarter of 2008.", "We increased income from operations as a percent of revenue year-over-year by 50 basis points to 15.6% in the first quarter of this year. Sharply higher diesel fuel prices impacted operating margin this quarter causing a negative 50 basis points impact. Excluding the impact of rising diesel prices income from operations as a percent of revenue would have expanded by a 100 basis points this quarter in line with our expectations for the quarter and for the year. As we go through 2008 we think it's important to look at margins absent any significant effects from the fuel surcharge program.", "Revenues grew 78 million or 2.4% in the first quarter this year with the most significant contributions coming from yield on our collection business and higher recycling commodity prices. Our internal revenue growth from yield on our base business was 3.2% marking the 9th time out of the last 10 quarters that our overall revenue growth from yield has exceeded 3%. If you include the benefit of higher recycling commodity prices and the impact of our fuel surcharge program, internal revenue growth from yield increased a total of 6.8% during the first quarter of 2008.", "Our collection pricing strategy continues to produce strong results. Combine the revenue growth from yield in the industrial, commercial, and residential lines of our collection business was 4.7% this quarter or 6.6% if we include the effect of our fuel surcharge. Pricing in the commercial collection line of business lead the way, with internal revenue growth from yield reaching 5.8% in the first quarter of this year. The yield components of internal revenue growth in our roll-off and residential lines of business were 3.8% and 4.1% respectively. These levels of revenue growth from higher yield is significant because they show that we've maintained our pricing discipline in spite of lower volumes.", "Another very positive sign of our pricing discipline is the strength of new business pricing in our roll-off business, which was up about 6% on a year-over-year basis, despite a continued softening in our temporary roll-off business. Our collection pricing programs have been the primary drivers of our earnings growth and margin expansion. As we expected and as we have seen for sometime, our pricing programs again affected our volumes but the trade-off remains positive as we've shed lower margin and unprofitable business.", "We've consistently followed our strategy to price our services to generate adequate returns on our investments, to fully recover our cost, and to expand our operating margins. In doing so we've targeted unprofitable and low margin business. Where we have lost volumes, we focused on flexing down our operating cost. The net result is higher income from operations and significant margin expansion in our collection line of business. The income from operations from our collection business grew by over 11% in the first-quarter of this year compared with the same period of 2007. And our income from operations margin in our collection business expanded by over 200 basis point.", "Our recycling operations turned in another strong performance in the first-quarter of the year, on the strength of higher recycling commodity prices and better re-bate structure that we have negotiated with our customers.", "Turning now to volume side, internal revenue growth from volumes on base business declined 3.9% in the first-quarter of 2008. Caused mainly by our pricing programs, economic related declines which occurred primary in our roll-off line of business and the harsh winter weather in the Mid West. However, the 3.9% rate of decline is the best work day adjusted volume performance we've had since the third quarter of 2006. Most of the volume loses in the quarter was in the collection side of the business, which fell by 5.7% during the first quarter of 2008. We estimate that our pricing program caused roughly 55% of collection volume loss, with the remainder due to the economy and bad weather. This is very close to the same pattern that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2007.", "During the course of 2008, we still expect the rate of decline in our volumes to improve partially because of easier year-over-year comps and partially because the most economically sensitive part of our business, temporary roll off, already saw a significant decline in 2007. We don't expect to see those levels of decline in our roll off business during 2008. And the other segments of our business is fairly recession resistant. So even in a slow economy, we still expect the rate of volume decline to moderate in 2008.", "Over the last few weeks, we've seen the volumes improve, although it's not clear whether this is a result of seasonality, the economy, or built-up demand from the harsh winter weather in the first quarter. We always say that the first few weeks of the quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the full quarter, but our volume reports from the first few weeks of April are certainly consistent with our expectations of moderating volume declines for the full year.", "In conclusion, our strategy again worked well and we plan to continue to execute it. I am pleased with the first quarter results, not only because we accomplished our primary financial goals but also because we overcame the impact of higher diesel fuel prices and harsh winter weather. We will continue to maintain our pricing discipline and control our operating costs, and we expect our operating cost as a percent of revenue to improve as we come out of the winter month. The first quarter has positioned our company for a successful 2008 and we are confident that we will meet the earnings and free cash flow targets we setout at the beginning of 2008. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry, who will review our operating cost results.", "Larry O'Donnell, III - President and Chief Operating Officer", "Thank you Dave and good morning everyone on the call. I am going to cover our operating cost results for the quarter. Operating expenses in the first quarter of 2008 were $2.092 billion or $58 million higher than in the 2007 quarter. As a percent of revenue, this is a 30 basis point increase in our operating cost from 63.8% of revenue to 64.1% of revenue. Excluding the impact of higher recycling commodity and higher diesel fuel prices, operating cost would have been $51 million lower during the first quarter of 2008 compared to the same period last year. Excluding these costs and their associated revenue, operating expenses as a percent of revenue would have improved by 80 basis point.", "I am pleased to say that we made good progress in managing our controllable operating costs in nearly all other areas during the quarter. On a percent of revenue basis we lowered first quarter 2008 operating costs in seven of the ten cost categories that we break out in our financial statements. These improvements once again show the positive impact of our consistent focus on controlling costs and pricing excellence and also reflect the impact of increased revenues from higher recycling commodity prices and fuel surcharges.", "Our labor and benefits costs improved by 45 basis points as a percentage of revenue during the first quarter of this year. On an absolute dollar basis, we held these costs flat when compared with the first quarter of 2007. This shows that we continue to flex down costs as volumes decline. We reduced our driver hours by about 728,000 hours in the first quarter of 2008 compared with the same period in 2007. Approximately 54% of this reduction was due to the ability of our field mangers to actively flex down our labor costs as volumes have declined. The remainder of the reduction in driver hours was due to divestitures.", "The first quarter is usually our toughest quarter for efficiency improvement in the unusually harsh winter weather during the quarter particularly in the Midwest certainly provided us some challenges. For example we experienced 25 days during the quarter where locations in the Midwest had to shut down operations and we had 2600 route days where we suspended or cancelled routes due to weather. We estimate that the severe winter weather cost us about $0.01 in earnings during the quarter.", "We expect to see stronger efficiency improvements going forward this year. Our maintenance and repair costs increased by only $2 million in the first quarter this year compared to the first quarter last year which is approximately a 15 basis point improvement as a percent of revenue. I should note that maintenance and repair expenses at our Wheelabrator waste energy facilities increased by $6 million in the first quarter. The maintenance cost at the Wheelabrator facilities can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on our scheduling of outages to perform maintenance and repairs. The level of expenditure at Wheelabrator during the first quarter of this year was consistent with our operating plan for the year. After adjusting for the Wheelabrator increases, maintenance cost improved on a year-over-year basis. This shows that our fleet maintenance improvement efforts have helped to offset the higher cost and labor rates, steel for us and oil based supplies such as lubricants.", "Considering that we estimate an annual inflation on our maintenance cost to be at least 4% I am pleased with this results. We expect to see continued progress in our maintenance cost during the year. Risk management cost improved nearly 20 basis points as a percent of revenue driven by lower workers compensation cost. The primary reason for the continued reduction in our risk management cost has been our tremendous improvement in our safety performance. This was the 29th consecutive quarter in which we improved our total reportable injury rate which is a safety measure.", "We improved our TRIR by about 10% in the first quarter this year compared to the same period in 2007 to a TRIR of less than 4. Transfer and disposal expenses which include those costs that our collection companies paid the third party land fills and transfer stations improved by over 90 basis points as a percent of revenue in the first quarter of 2008. Our improvements in this area reflect our continued focus on fixing or exiting low margin collection businesses where we don't internalize the volume.", "Sub-contractor cost improved by about 5 basis points in the quarter as we used pure third party contractors due to the lower volumes and divestitures. This was partially offset by higher fuel cost, passed on to us by third party contractors. Higher direct diesel fuel cost caused 110 basis point increase in operating expense as a percent of revenues. Average fuel costs in the first quarter of 2008 were about $1 per gallon higher than in the first quarter of 2007. These record high diesel prices, not only negatively affected our operating margins, but also lowered earnings by approximately $0.01 per share because the fuel surcharge revenue lagged the steep increase of both higher direct fuel cost and the indirect fuel cost passed on to us by sub-contractor haulers.", "Due to the higher recycling commodity prices in the first quarter of 2008, our cost of goods sold category increased by nearly a 140 basis points. While this negatively impacted our reported operating expenses and squeezed our operating margins, the overall impact on our recycling earnings in return is positive. We expect recycling commodity prices to remain strong throughout 2008. I am pleased with our performance in controlling our operating costs. Our progressing these areas was due to the efforts of our employees who continued to utilize the tools, systems, and standard practices that we've deployed over the last several years.", "We remain committed to our cost control and pricing strategy, which we expect will drive the operational and financial success that we project for the remainder of 2008. With that I'll turn the call over to Bob.", "Robert G. Simpson - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you Larry, I will start with a review of SG&A cost for the first quarter of 2008. SG&A expenses were 11.3% of revenue during the first quarter of 2008, which was in line with our expectations. Our year-over-year costs increased $15 million in the first quarter of 2008 compared with the first quarter of 2007. This year-over-year increase was primarily due to increased sales and marketing spending and an increase in our provision for bad debts.", "Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter of 2008 was down $13 million when compared with the first quarter of 2007. The year-over-year decline is primary due to the impacts of lower landfill volumes and divestitures. As a percent of revenue, depreciation and amortization expense was 9.1% compared with 9.7% in the prior year quarter. Interest expense was $122 million in the first quarter of this year, a $13 million decrease from 2007. This decrease was due primarily to the lower interest rate environment we have seen in 2008. Interest income decreased $13 million year-over-year due in part to the decrease in our cash and investment balances and the lower interest rate environment.", "In addition in the first quarter of 2007 we received $7 million in non-recurring interest income from the favorable resolution of a tax mirror. Moving to income taxes, in our press release we noted a $6 million benefit to net income in the first quarter of 2008, compared with the benefit of $16 million in the first quarter of 2007. These benefits result primarily from income tax audit settlements. In the first quarter of 2008, our effective tax rate excluding the $6 million benefit was approximately 39%. We expect our effective tax rate for the remainder of the year to be approximately 40%. Total reported debt increased by $382 million at the end the quarter compared with the end of 2007. Our adjusted total capital ratio increased to 60.8%, inline with our objective to be around 60%.", "In March of this year, we issued $600 million in senior notes, priced at about 6%. We used a portion of these funds to pay down borrowings on our credit revolver and on May 1, we will repay $244 million of senior notes that would have matured in 2018, but are callable. The interest rate on those notes is 8.75% which makes calling the notes attractive. We produced strong free cash flow during the first quarter. Net cash from operations was $561 million with capital expenditures of $213 million during the quarter, including $14 million of net proceeds from divestitures and sales of assets, our free cash flow was $362 million for the quarter. We repurchased approximately 9 million shares for $281 million during the first quarter. We also paid $133 million in cash dividends, marking the first payment of our higher quarterly dividend of $0.27 per share which is a 12.5% increase over the last year. At yesterday's closing stock price, our dividend payment equates to a yield of over 3%.", "As we previously noted, we expect the amount we will spend on acquisitions during 2008 will exceed proceeds from divestitures and asset sales during 2008. In the first quarter of this year, we spent approximately $70 million for acquisitions while receiving approximately $14 million from proceeds from divestitures and asset sales.", "In closing, we are off to a solid start for the year, and as David and Larry indicated, we will continue to execute our pricing and operational excellence strategies. We are confident, this will lead to our achieving the full year 2008 earnings and cash flow guidance which we reaffirm today. And with that Nicole, let us open the line for questions.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Jonathan Ellis with Merrill Lynch.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Good morning guys.", "Robert G. Simpson - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning.", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Wondering if you can talk a little bit more about pricing at the landfills and specifically gate rates versus contract pricing at the landfills?", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, you know Jonathan overall when you look at it on a per ton basis we are seeing pricing in the 3% to 5% range. Clearly we are seeing gate rates that are above that and we are seeing contract renewal rates... when we see the contract renewal rates up here we are seeing them in the range of 7% to 10%. So obviously we are not able to hit all of that contracted volume in any one particular year, but overall we think the pricing program at the landfills is working very well. We expect that to continue.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Great and could you talk about where you are in percentage terms or may be qualitatively, how far are you along in revising landfill contracts?", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "How do you mean reviving landfill contracts?", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "As they come up for renewal and seeking to get more favorable terms, what percentage of the contracts are coming for renewal at this point that you have successfully renegotiated for higher rates?", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, when you look at it and there is two things, there is higher rates and then there is as you say there is better terms i.e. things like the fuel surcharge, the environmental surcharge. A number of those contracts were allowed to pass those through under the contract already. About two years ago we started, actually probably more like 3 or 4 years ago, we started putting in to all of our contracts, whether they were collection, large miniscule collection contracts, or landfill contracts, we started putting in provisions that allowed us to pass through things like change in law provisions because you have fees and taxes that are raised to state. So most of our contracts have gone through that. As far as the pricing goes, my guess is and it will only be a guess, because of the amount of time that we've been in landfill price is excellent, is that we've gotten through roughly half of our contracts that have gone through price increases in last 2 years.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay great and just on the volume side, could you talk a little bit more again at the landfills about volume trends for MSW, C&D, and special waste?", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, they're following sort of the same trends that we saw late last year. We do think that we've seen a drop in those volumes, as of late last year, but they are following the same trend. And when I say the same trend, C&D is down more than special waste and MSW obviously because of the housing market. But what we see, its always a little bit difficult to talk about volumes in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter because of how seasonality affects us, but we do believe that we've seen a drop in the volumes and that we're going to see the volumes, the rate of decline improved throughout 2008.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay great and would you be able to, I don't know if you have this information available, but break out internal revenue growth from yield for the permanent versus temporary roll-off businesses?", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "No, we do not have that broken out Jonathan. I am sorry, we don't break it out that way ourselves. I'd love to give it to you but we don't break it out ourselves that way. But as we said the overall increase was 3.8% and new business pricing, I think even more importantly, when you're in a down economy to have new business pricing up 6% in the industrial line, I think is a pretty strong accomplishment.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Great. And just very quickly on IRG from yield do you have what the impact from environmental fees were this quarter on that number? And the total number for the company?", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. Greg has that number.", "Gregory G. Nikkel - Director of Investor Relations", "Yeah that number... year-over-year increase was about $20 million due to the increased environmental fee.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Great. And then just my final question is are you seen any increase push back from customers either for higher environmental fees or higher fuel surcharges given with the microeconomic back drop?", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "You know we really aren't, I think we always expected to see that and quite frankly over the last three years, we've always thought that there might be a little bit more pushback. But I think that consumers, they see the news just like we see the news. They know that the cost are going up, they particularly know the fuel cost are going up. And so certainly you have some folks to ask about it. We do a very good job on our website and in out communications with our customers of telling them why they are coming through. But we really haven't seen any losses of volumes because of the surcharges.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Thanks guys.", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Levine with JP Morgan.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan", "Hi guys.", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Good morning.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan", "It sounds like the volumes came in for the quarter maybe in line little better than you guys had expected, given what happened with weather in the mid-West. Could you take a stab at quantifying the impact that the harsh weather had on your volumes? And give us a little bit of a sense as to what expectations you have baked into your expectations for the year for volumes including both the temporary roll-off segment, this cyclical business lines you have?", "Robert G. Simpson - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes remember, at the beginning of the year we said volumes negative 2.5% to 3%. So clearly the first quarter was a little bit weaker than that. Now also remember that during the course of the year comps get easier too. So we are going to get some benefit from that. But again, it's difficult to see what happens in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter because of weather, we think that the harsh weather probably cost us about 20 basis points in our volume. But the good news that we've seen is that very virtually all of the line, we've seen the rate of decline slow. Even in our temporary roll-off line where we down about 9.4% and in our C&D line where we're down 15% which are big numbers, but are way-off of where the high numbers were at last year.", "So we do expect during the course of the year, even in a weaker economy that we're going to see volumes improve. One of the other statistics that we look at that's... that I think gives us optimism for the year is new business. And we added about 23% more new business in the first quarter than we did in the first quarter 2007. So again it's a little bit difficult to make a call just based on the first quarter because of the severe effect of weather. And again, like I said it's a little bit difficult to use the first few weeks of April to indicate what's going to happen in the second quarter. But certainly when we look at it over a longer period of time over a three, four quarter period of time, we think we've seen the drop in volumes and we think we'll see the rate of decline moderate during 2008.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan", "Understood. Turning to... turning to recycling, could you have sort of guess on what the EPS... it's something that was a benefit in the quarter. Has there I guess somewhat the impact was there, and when you say further strength in recycling is expected throughout '08, do you mean further increases in the cycle commodity prices? Or you kind of expecting prices to remain at current levels?", "Robert G. Simpson - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The pricing... the commodity pricing, we expect it, really stay about what we've seen at current levels, much like what we saw throughout last year. When you look at... in terms of what impact it had on EPS that was about $0.02.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan", "Okay. And lastly turning to SAP I was hopping you guys maybe able to give us an update, we have seen some news items on the tape in recent months.", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Quite frankly SAP turned into as you can imagine a big disappointment for us. I mean, basically it a simple case and we don't use the word lightly, its a simple case of fraud, where SAP promised us a product and then... and knew they did not have it and try to cover up the fact they didn't have it. What they promised us what they guaranteed does in the contract was an out of the box solution without modification. In fact when they demonstrated it to us what they did was base fake the mark up, so they looked like it was out of the box solutions. And then when they went and piloted it in New Mexico, they basically and knew that the product didn't work, but they tried to get us to pay for fixing it when they were responsible for fixing it under the contract.", "And we found out what was going on, we said we got a contract with you folks, we want you to fix the software like you promised us and you've got to pay for it on your nickel not on our nickel. At that point they refused to fix the software and we sited them. So... and they refused to fix the software once again. So, again it's a simple case of fraud and fully expect to receive all of our damages when we got to trail.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan", "And too early to think about the charge here at this stage again?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Scott, I think that right under the accounting rules, you have to make that decision once you really come to a point where you are having another plant in place. We are studying how the alternative now, we successfully migrate in Mexico back to the old system NAS. We're going to make some enhancement to NAS that will help us to achieve some of the benefits we are hoping to get. And we'll continue, we're looking at other alternative. Now when we make a final decision on what those alternative are and perhaps make a commitment to go down that road, we'll re-visit when the write-off will take place. At this point, the write-off is between... somewhere between $46 million and $51 million. It's just a matter of the timing.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan", "Got it. Thanks guys. Nice quarter.", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Robert G. Simpson - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Fisher with Raymond James.", "Bill Fisher - Raymond James", "Well I just had two minor questions, on the recycling side it looks like you had $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion run rate now. I was just wondering what the rough size of the brokerage operation is, right now?", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Our brokerage out of the total is probably somewhere around 30% to 40% now. That's... we actually saw increased brokerage in Q1. That continued to be good business for us as we have described in the past, a good returns that we get from that business.", "Bill Fisher - Raymond James", "Okay. And just for Bob, in terms... I know you did some things of debt in the quarter. What would be the rough mix of the fixed debt now at the end of March?", "Robert G. Simpson - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "36% of our entire debt is floating.", "Bill Fisher - Raymond James", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nicole Douglas [ph] with Deutsche Bank.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Can you hear me?", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, go ahead Nick.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay sorry. I just... most of my questions have been answered. But going back you guys said that you expect acquisitions to offset divestures fully this year and come in ahead. I was hoping you might be able to talk about the deal pipeline and if you see deal activity picking up?", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, actually what we said was that we think we will spend more and... the last couple of years we spend on more divestiture mode. This year we think that it will switch around we'll be more in acquisition mode than we are in divestiture mode. With $70 million in the first quarter as opposed to $14 million in divestitures, we pointed out that is sort of the turning point for us.", "So when we look at the deal pipeline, we see some good deals out there. We see some deals out there that are not only good solid tuck-in acquisitions for us, but actually some that will help us provide some services to our customers that we currently don't provide to our customers. And so when we look at business through out the country, we got customers that are looking for more C&D recycling. We've got customers that are looking for more electronics recycling. We've got customers that are looking for a lot of different services in addition to there solid waste. So we not only see a good solid pipeline in the solid waste business, but we see a good pipeline and the other businesses that are very closely related to our core and that our customers want.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Great that's helpful. Thank you", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Corey Greendale with First Analysis.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "Morning.", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning Corey.", "Robert G. Simpson - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "Yes it seems to be a bit of a lag probably afraid I'll start swearing or something.", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "We hope we didn't have a quarter that caused you to swear.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "It only be in a good way. So the first question I think David in answering another question you said that new business was up 23% from last year, did I get that right? And what's the pricing look like on that new business?", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, when we price our new business clearly we are pricing at levels that are much higher. When you look at it and again we'll talk about the commercial line of business. From the commercial line of business you see the new progress again similar to the roll-off line of business up in the 6% to 8% range. And then... that's year-over-year. And, the new business pricing its not a huge amount of dollars, it's about a $1.5 million, but it's good to see that we're now adding more business than we're shutting, and we expect that again to continue throughout 2008.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "And, I know you've been adding more on the sales and marketing side, do you think their new business... I would assume given what the economy is doing with, that's more taking share than it is new business developments or new municipality that kind of things. So is your sense that you're taking share from smaller players or where's that business coming from?", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Oh, I think that you do see a little bit of organic growth. But Corey, we'd never really looked at... we look at where we're losing the business to, clearly we're predominantly losing the business to the local regional player, just a map I would assume that we're gaining share from those local regional players.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "Okay. Then I wanted to ask about your customer audit. I think you said last call that you were moving more towards the national accounts now and just wondering how that effort is going? And how much longer you have to go on that whole project?", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, the national accounts part of it, your absolutely right, the national accounts is the slower part, because you have to audit the customers throughout the footprint of the national account before you're ready to do anything. We expect that will end third, fourth quarter of this year. And how is it going? Obviously with national accounts you're not going to have as much success as you have with individual accounts. But again, our customers recognized just like everybody that fuel prices are going up, they're getting cost sensitive too. So we are actually having some pretty good success passing through some of those costs.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "And Dave, when you say not as much success, do you mean more customers are choosing to walk away to competitors? Or you mean it is getting lesser price increases?", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, no we're just getting lesser price increases. Most of these national accounts we have a contract with. And so it's a little bit harder to get a price increase from someone that you have as firm contract with and someone that you have a contract that allows for the price increase.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "And a question for Larry, you... in going to the cost items, you talked about the relative impact on labor cost flexing down cost for lower volume and then divestitures. Can you talk about how much opportunity remains to take routs out or improve routing efficiency independent of volume declines?", "Larry O'Donnell, III - President and Chief Operating Officer", "Well, I think there is still opportunity to do that. As we went through the BIP process, and actually lost some of those customers, what we're now doing is going back through and looking at our route structure and doing a lot rerouting to make sure that we're been rebuilding those routes where they... they are much more efficient than they were before, particularly with the economy, it's slow as it is. But I guess its an opportunity to really look at how we're running our routes and get some efficiencies out of that. So in terms of where we are in the process, I really couldn't estimate how far or long we are but it is our plan to get through all those reroutes, that's something we always do. But in terms of the ones related to BIP that's part of what our focus and our plan is for this year, is to get through rerouting that had to do with VIP changes in our route structure.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Hussey with Goldman Sachs.", "Chris Hussey - Goldman Sachs", "Good morning fellows.", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Robert G. Simpson - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning.", "Gregory G. Nikkel - Director of Investor Relations", "Good morning.", "Chris Hussey - Goldman Sachs", "Quick questions. Maybe you could just follow-up a little bit, comments you made about the volume improvement you're seeing in April, just a little bit more color on that. Are you seeing out of any particular end market, any particular region that's doing better than other?", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "We're really seeing sort of what we've seen over the last year which is, and what we talked about back when the economy was booming which is, if you want to be a company that's focused primarily in the sunbelt, you're going to do great when the economy is booming. But you're not going to so great when the economy is not booming. And we always said that our geographic foot print for us is something that we think over the long-term is going to benefit us. So what we seen us is not so much in the mid-West and the East are booming, but they never did boom, so they are not slowing down quite as fast. And so the mid-West and the East are strong for us in the sense that they are maintaining a slower declined of volume, even though we've continue to see volume decrease in the West and in the south.", "And so again we think it an indication that our geographic foot print in an economic downturn is going to benefit us just like sometimes it hurt us when the sun belt state boom.", "Chris Hussey - Goldman Sachs", "So but the reason observation is then very said not seeing necessary thing coming out of the self in the West but actually seeing things maybe improving more out of the mid-West and the East?", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Relatively speaking they are improving better in the mid-West than the east.", "Chris Hussey - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. That is fair. And then I can't help myself with talking about the acquisition strategy you mentioned in subery [ph] services might this include buying some more storage services?", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Yes not in the foreseeable future I mean certainly we're in that business, we're not made business in a big way. When I talked about closely related to our cored that is they would just a business but its not as closely related cored as the thing that current customer are again things like in C&D recycling, electronic recycling lot of different program, single stream recycling from municipality. Certainly I won't preclude us from being more into the storage business. But I don't see doing the material acquisition in that arena in the near future.", "Chris Hussey - Goldman Sachs", "So more about recycling acquisition then?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Recycling and solid waste, core truck in solid waste acquisition.", "Chris Hussey - Goldman Sachs", "Great, usual stuff. And how about waste energy and any thought there?", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "You know waste energy as we talked about, there are more of these on the street in waste energy today than there have been in the last 20 years and we full expect to play in that arena.", "Chris Hussey - Goldman Sachs", "So you guys will, when should we expect you guys to start and when are you going to start to open more of waste energy plants.", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Well you know it's not really up to us, it's up to the bidding process, so when you look at the RLPs, it's really up to the municipalities to determine the timing on that.", "Chris Hussey - Goldman Sachs", "What's your best guess?", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Well you know those things take a long period of time if you look for example, Baltimore's just announced that they are going to look to build a new 1500 ton plant and we expected that RLP to come out probably nine months ago. So you know those things take some time. The municipalities have to work through the issues that they have got with the public and they have got to work through siding issues and so it's really difficult for us to even guess but I would expect that you will see a couple of those bids awarded in 2008.", "Chris Hussey - Goldman Sachs", "Great, last question on the landfill pricing, you said that about 505 through... 50% of contracts you haven't really touched pricing on, what could we expect in contracts that you had touched pricing on. When we... as we go forward what do you think the sustainable pricing growth of your landfill is?", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, you know when you look at the landfill and you know we have talked about it quite a bit which is that you can be a little bit more aggressive in the pricing of the landfill because it's not like an airline seat. You know, an airline seat if you don't sell it today, you will never sell it again. You would have turnabout of land to air space [ph]. If you don't sell it today there is only one thing you can be guaranteed of, you will sell it for more in the future. So you know long term I think that the landfill pricing should exceed the collection pricing. You know it is a little bit difficult for us to go through and analyze this because obviously you have got three different streams in there that are priced completely different. You have got a huge mix issue in other words between special waste C&D and MSW. So when we look at it, we look at it primary from an MSW point of view, and from an MSW point of view and we certainly think that land field pricing should meet our long-term pricing goal which is 50 to 100 basis point above CPI if not better.", "Chris Hussey - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks guys. Appreciate it.", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Robert G. Simpson - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks Chris.", "Operator", "Your next question come from the line of Leone Young with Citigroup.", "Leone Young - Citigroup", "Yes good morning.", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning Leone.", "Robert G. Simpson - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning.", "Leone Young - Citigroup", "First of all just as you mentioned the obviously the rest two businesses out roll-off is pretty defensive. In fact are you seeing any impact from the economy, in your sort of bread and butter of commercial line of business changes in service intervals that 10%?", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Yes we are seeing as slight changes in the service intervals probably that was about Greg remind me if I am wrong, about $500,000 less of an increase. In other words, we are still getting net service increases, but it was about $500,000 less of an increase than it was last year. So we are still seeing net service increases, just at a little bit of slower rate. And again its hard to tell with that small of a number $500,000 its really hard to tell, if that's from the economy or that's just a natural order of thing. So we don't see anything in the commercial line of business that leads us to be overly worried that we are going to face a dramatic drop-off in the next three quarters.", "Leone Young - Citigroup", "And also on SG&A, Bob mentioned that it was largely in line of what you expected in the first quarter. But turning perhaps bit higher than previous goals you would had, would you take a shallow lead on longer term or '08 target for SG&A?", "Robert G. Simpson - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Or if we, I think we set the---real, hit the beginning of the year the forecast was about a little over 10.5% and I would not change in that all. Over the longer terms, our goal was to get it down in to nine or below and lot of the investments we are making right now, we think will help us get there.", "Leone Young - Citigroup", "That's great. And then just lastly still looking for about $1.5 billion in CapEx?", "Robert G. Simpson - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes that's right at this point, we are very focused on it and well the fleet purchases that we intend to make this year, we intend to make, because of the 2010 engines in effect that we under bought in 2007. So we are very focused on land field construction if the volumes slow down at the point where we don't need to expand or salvage here, we will put that off if the, volume are such to container purchases are not necessary we will deal with that do, we got our eye on it and we will continue to reflect down as we need to and the meantime we will, we are not going to change our estimates right now.", "Leone Young - Citigroup", "Terrific. Thanks a lot.", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Alright.", "Robert G. Simpson - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you Leon.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line Brian Butler with FBR.", "Brian Butler - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey", "Yes, Good morning.", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning Brian.", "Robert G. Simpson - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning.", "Brian Butler - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey", "One quick question on the depreciation and amortization little bit low on the lower side as the volumes slow up is that kind of the amount of percent of revenue basis kind of the right number to looking at kind of that 9%, 9.1%?", "Robert G. Simpson - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You know I think it some where between 9.1% and 9.5%. Its probably where you are to be thinking is volumes come back or is volume pick up during the year, that could very well build up some more. So it's just a matter of where the volumes actually come out. Truly 75% of the difference is related to the lower volumes into the land field.", "Brian Butler - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey", "Okay. And then a one quick question on your marketing campaign, you guys have been out there, pushing marketing side, from a strategic point of view are you, how is that paying off are you seeing any intangible benefits, either in the bidding process or any where else and what you think of that program on a go forward basis?", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Yes Brian I think from our point of view we see both tangible and intangible benefits, we have talked about it quite a bit in the past few years that from a tangible point of view, you know its always hard to measure the bank for the bulks from an advertising point of view and so we have to, we measure it by looking at actually how consumer attitude change as a result of the advertising campaign, in other words what are the attitudes before ads and what are the attitudes after the ads and we started the campaign we were getting changes in consumer attitude in the range of 40% to 50%. We are still getting changes in consumer attitude in the range of 20 to 30% and so certainly from a measurement point of view, we are still seeing the benefits now from a anecdote point of view I think the point you make is exactly right, we hear from a lot of customers and in fact I can tell you, every time I have met with the customer, one of the things they say, is we have seen your ad campaign and we love your ad campaign and that goes all the way from the small commercial customer to the large industrial customer to the municipality.", "Also Anecdote when we talked about Land field expansion and we talk about permits that we have made it, we have had both safe at us, it helps us to review your process, that you have got this ad campaign that makes the public field little bit better about you and any time you go in front of the public for a public hearing and the public feels a little bit better about your company you are going to have an advantage, so I think we have seen full tangible and intangible benefits and then finally from our current employees and from prospective employees we get the same thing, from prospective employee we hear vow, we didn't realize you all did, all of these amazing things this sound like a great place to work and from our current employees obviously you get that feeling of proud that they get every time that they see commercial on TV, so we have certainly got a number of measurable benefit and we continue to receive intangible benefits.", "Brian Butler - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey", "Great thanks a lot guys.", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. David Stenier for any closing remarks.", "David P. Steiner - Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Nicole. Well clearly we are very happy with our first quarter and we are very optimistic for 2008. We look forward to sharing our results with you during the course of the year. And we look forward to see in all of you all on the road as we get out their during the course in year.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions).", "I would now like to introduce Mr. Jim Alderson, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin your conference.", "Jim Alderson", "Thank you, Nicole. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter 2008 earnings conference call. With me this morning are David Steiner, Chief Executive Officer; Larry O'Donnell, President and Chief Operating Officer and Bob Simpson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "David will start things off with a summary of the financial results for the quarter and a review of the details of our revenue growth, including price and volume trends. Larry will discuss operating costs and Bob will cover the financial statements. We will conclude with questions-and-answers.", "Before we started let me remind you that in addition to our press release that was issued this morning, we have filed a Form 8-K that includes the press release as an attachment and is available on our website at www.wm.com the press release and schedule to the release include important information that you should refer to. That is because during these discussions of our 2008 results of operations, we will be providing estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.", "These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that are described in detail in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, and in our press release this morning. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.", "During the course of the presentation, we also will discuss certain financial measures on an as-adjusted basis, just as we have presented them in our press release this morning. These measures include net income, earnings per share, income from operations, operating expenses and certain operating margins, all adjusted for items we deem unusual or non-operational in nature. We will also discuss free cash flow, all of these are non-GAAP financial measures.", "When David, Larry and Bob discuss the results we've presented in our press release, their comments will also be on an as-adjusted basis. Specifically, these adjustments include, a $13 million reduction in net income due to charges related to our withdrawal from union-sponsored, multi-employer pension plan in Milwaukee, New Jersey and Detroit. The $16 million reduction in net income caused primarily by the accounting effect of a decline in long-term interest rates, which are used to calculate the present value of our remediation liabilities and our landfills. And a $6 million benefit resulting primarily from favorable tax audit settlement.", "We have given detailed information on all of the non-GAAP measures that will be discussed on this morning's call, and have reconciled them to the most comparable GAAP measures. And you can find that information in the schedule to our earnings press release or on the Form 8-K filed today, which as I mentioned can be found on the Company's website, at www.wm.com.", "This call will be recorded and will be available 24 hours a day beginning approximately 1 PM Eastern Time today until 5 PM Eastern Time on February 26. To hear a replay of the call over the Internet, access the Waste Management website, at www.wm.com. To hear a telephonic replay of the call, dial 800-642-1687 and enter reservation code 80418207.", "Time sensitive information given during the course of today's call, which is occurring on February 12, 2009, may no longer be accurate at the time of the replay. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of Waste Management is prohibited.", "Now I will turn the call over to Waste Management's CEO, David Steiner.", "David P. Steiner", "Thank you, Jim. And good morning from Houston. I'm pleased with the high level of performance throughout our organization. We faced significant challenges in the fourth quarter, as commodity prices dropped shortly and volume declines accelerated, but we still posted strong financial results. Our cash generating abilities were proven once again in 2008, and we expect that to continue in 2009.", "We earned $0.49 per share in 2008's fourth quarter. In November we announced that we're expecting a negative year-over-year impact of $0.04 to $0.08 per diluted share on our fourth quarter 2008 earnings from our recycling operations and the result was an $0.08 hit.", "So, if we further adjust the fourth quarter of 2008 for the negative impact of commodity price declines, we earned $0.57 in the fourth quarter of 2008. This is an increase of $0.03 per diluted share, however 5.5% when compared with our fourth quarter 2007 results.", "For the full year 2008, after adjusting for items other than recycling, we earned $2.22 per diluted share an increase of greater than 7% when compared with 2007 adjusted results.", "We ended 2008 at the high-end of the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year, which was $2.19 to $2.23 per diluted share. Again we would have significantly exceeded that guidance if not for the negative impact from recycling operations in the fourth quarter. These are significant accomplishments for our full year and our tribute to the hard work and dedication of our employees.", "Going back to the fourth quarter, internal revenue growth from volumes declined 5.9% in the quarter. Most of the volume losses were in the collection side of the business which fell by 6.2% during the fourth quarter of 2008. The recession resistant lines of our business, namely commercial and residential collections saw volumes similar to what we've seen all year, at about negative 4%. The most economically sensitive line of our business, the roll-off line, saw volume losses of 11.7%. This loss of volumes was offset by a continued focus on roll-off pricing, which was up 3% for the quarter. We've continued to see good pricing in our roll-off line and certainly we will continue with our pricing strategy in 2009.", "So, overall, income continued to increase in the collection line of business. Income from operations increased almost 6% in the fourth quarter this year compared with the same period of 2007. And our income from operations margins in our collection business expanded by 230 basis points.", "Our fourth quarter 2008 internal revenue growth from yield was 2.1%, and was strongest in our three collection lines of business. Combined, the revenue growth from yield in the industrial, commercial and residential lines of our collection business was 3.3% in the fourth quarter which excludes the impact of our fuel surcharge.", "We produced our strongest results in our commercial collection line of business, where internal revenue growth from yield was 3.8% in the quarter. The yield components of internal revenue growth in our industrial and residential lines of business were 3%, and 2.8% respectively. These levels of revenue growth from yield was significant because they show that we've maintained our pricing discipline despite the difficult economic environment. We will continue to pursue pricing opportunities and believe we can continue achieve yield of at least 50 to 100 basis points above core CPI.", "Turning to yield and volume on the disposal side of business, the positive volume trends we saw in Q2 and Q3 reversed, as volumes dropped 1.4% in the fourth quarter. The declines occurred in MSW which was down 3.6% and special waste which was down 2.4%. However, despite the lower MSW volumes, we continued our focus on MSW yield, which increased 2.4% in the quarter. We intend to increase this focus in 2009. As we anticipated in November, our recycling operations were particularly weak in the fourth quarter due to the significant decline in recycling commodity prices and volumes, causing a $38 million in net income or $0.08 per diluted share compared to the fourth quarter 2007.", "For the full year 2008, the commodity price and volume impact to earnings was a negative $16 million or $0.02 per deluded share compared to 2007. We're working on reducing our cost structure and reviving our pricing and rebate model in our recycling operations. We still expect that 2009 will be a difficult year.", "Energy markets also experienced declines in the fourth quarter of 2008, which adversely impact the revenues of our Wheelabrator and landfill gas to energy operations. Combined, we believe the recycling and energy effects will result in an EPS headwind of between $0.17 and $0.23 for the full year 2009. Most of that would occur in the first half for the year, as we assumed the commodity and energy prices will move towards historic averages later in the year.", "Given the weak economy and the effect on our volumes, it's more important than ever for us to maintain our disciplined approach to pricing and cost controls. On the pricing front, we're setting minimum yield targets at each of our market areas and groups at and our corporate headquarters. These targets will apply to both our collection and landfill lines of business. If we do not meet the targets, bonus eligible employees will not receive any portion of the annual bonus connected to financial results, for our senior leadership team that is 100% of the annual bonus and for others it's 70%. Certainly this will maximize the focus on our pricing initiatives at all levels of the company.", "On the cost side, as announced in our press release, we created a new operations and support structure and in the process reduced the number of market areas from 45 to 25 which will reduce our SG&A cost to reflect our lower volumes. This is the next step in our evolution to adjust our organization and operating model so that we can be more efficient and allow us to emerge from an economic downturn as an even stronger company, poised for growth. Larry O'Donnell will give you more information about these changes.", "As the economy began to weaken in 2008, we began to pluck various scenarios around how we would react to a downturn. When commodity markets collapsed and the economy further weakened in late 2008, we were revised our business plans to take the changes in the economy into account.", "The reorganization of our business reflects our revised view of the economy and our business. We've also looked at out capital spend, to make sure that we're managing our spend to match our business. As 2009 unfolds, we will continue to ensure that we can respond as conditions warrant.", "2009 will certainly be a challenging year. We saw a significant drop-off in demand from October to November. From November to January, we've seen continued declines but at a slower rate. It's hard to determine when these declines will stabilize, so trying to predict volumes in 2009 is challenging. But regardless of how our volumes trend in 2009, we can assure you of three things. First, we've taken the actions necessary to reduce our cost structure by over $100 million and our field operations team has the tools to continue to flex cost if volumes continue to decline. They also have the equipment to handle volumes when they begin to grow again.", "Second, we will maintain our focus on pricing in our collection and disposal lines. We've demonstrated our resolve by tying annual bonuses for the achievement of specific pricing targets. And third, we're very mindful of our invertors focus on cash generation and we will ensure that we manage our capital in a manner that produces strong free cash flow. For the year, we expect to generate between 1.3 and $1.4 billion of free cash.", "In 2009, we also expect to acquire more revenue than we divest as valuations and prices for assets reach lower levels. However, we will not make any acquisitions that would jeopardize our strong balance sheet and our credit rating.", "Finally, I'd also like to highlight the selection of Wheelabrator Technologies as the preferred vendor to construct and operate a new regional waste to energy facility for Frederick and Carroll counties in Maryland. This will be the first new Greenfield waste-to-energy plant constructed in the United States in over a decade. This facility will be paid for and owned by the Northeast Maryland Waste Disposal Authority and is slated to be operational in 2014. It is one of a number waste-to-energy projects that Wheelabrator is pursuing in North America and in Europe.", "We expect that we will continue to win bids for new waste-to-energy plants both domestically and internationally. Most of the projects that we're bidding on do not require us to have spend significant amounts of capital. Because destruction cost of financed by the public authorities building the plant. For any that we may win that require us to pay some or all of the construction costs, those costs will be incurred until at least two to four years after the award.", "So, we're excited about the Wheelabrator business and that have provide meaningful future growth but it is not dependent on current capital outlays. We're pleased to have been selected by the authority and we're excited about the opportunity to help them and other communities to generate clean renewable energy from the disposable of their waste.", "With that I'll turn it over to Larry, who will review our operating cost results for you.", "Lawrence O'Donnell, III", "Thank you David and good morning. I'll begin by reviewing our operating cost results for the quarter and for the full year of 2008 after which I'll discuss details regarding our restructuring.", "Adjusting for the items noted in our press release, operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2008 were 1,918 billion or 61.7% of revenue, a decrease of $207 million from the fourth quarter of 2007, and an improvement of 150 basis points as a percentage of revenue. The cost reduction is due primarily to flexing down cost in response to decreased volumes, lower recycling commodity prices which results in lower rebase we pay to our customers, lower fuel cost from the decline in the diesel fuel prices and the decline in the exchange rate of the Canadian Dollar.", "We lowered fourth quarter 2008 operating cost in 8 of 10 cost category that we break out in our financial statements. For the full year 2008, we lowered operating expenses as a percent of revenue by over 30 basis point to 62.6%. Excluding the impact of higher recycling commodity and higher diesel fuel prices. Operating cost for the full year 2008, were $262 million lower than in 2007 and improved by 110 basis points to 61.8%.", "I am pleased with the disciplined approach exhibited by our team in managing our controllable operating costs during tough economic conditions. We demonstrated the value of our operational excellence initiatives, by flexing our cost in reaction to the current economic downturn.", "I will now review our performance for the fourth quarter 2008, compared to the prior year period in a number of the cost categories. Labor and employee benefit cost improved by $28 million in the quarter. This improvement is the result primarily of flexing down our cost in reaction to the volume decline. We reduced our driver hours by about 851,000 hours, approximately 88% of this reduction was due to the same flexing down of our labor cost with the remainder due to divestitures. Our total recordable injury rate was reduced to 2.9 in the fourth quarter a 25.8% improvement, compared to the prior year period. We're very pleased with this achievement, which places us even closer to world class performance in safety.", "Cost of goods sold decreased by $67 million, which is an improvement of over 160 basis points as a percent of revenue, principally due to recycling decline. Transfer and disposal expenses, which include those costs that our collection companies paid to third-party landfills and transfer stations, improved by $42 million or over 65 basis points as a percent of revenue. We lowered our maintenance and repair cost by $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with the fourth quarter of 2007. The efforts we've made to standardize our fleet and institute a cost effective, preventative maintenance program have helped us to react quickly to volume declines and to offset the higher cost we've seen in labor rates, parts and supplies.", "For the full year 2008, we improved our collection fleet maintenance cost by $35 million, compared to 2007. Falling diesel fuel prices, lowered our direct fuel cost by approximately $13 million and lowered indirect fuel cost charged to us by our subcontract transportation haulers by approximately $2 million, compared to fourth quarter of 2007. Fuel surcharge revenues decline in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to the fourth quarter of 2007, but at a slower rate than fuel cost decline, giving us approximately $25 million of benefit in the quarter.", "You will recall that in the first two quarters of 2008, our fuel surcharge fell short of our increase in fuel cost by about the same amount. For the full year, our fuel surcharge program worked as designed and essentially covered our increased fuel cost.", "As mentioned by David and in our press release, we've restructured our operations and reduced the number of market areas from 45 to 25. The actions we've taken are expected to provide us over a $100 million of cost savings in 2009. We expect to incur a one time charge of approximately $50 million for this restructuring.", "As we reviewed our strategy, we saw trends that suggested to us that now was the time to take the next step in our evolution. We want to continue to deliver the financial results our shareholders have come to expect from us. The trends we saw include customer desires for even higher quality service levels which in turn allows us to maintain our pricing leadership. We also see customers increasingly turning to us to assist them with their sustainability practices to help them reduce their cost. In addition while we've made progress in improving our operating margin and our returns on invested capital, we know we must continue to improve if we are to become a truly great company.", "We've also seen the benefits from economies of scale and standardization of practices that our larger market areas have been able achieve. As we've developed our strategy to address these trends, we concluded that we were now ready to roll out this model company wide. When we first went to the market area organizational structure about eight years ago, we had 85 market areas, as our culture has changed and our operating excellence initiatives have become engrained in our daily operating practices, we've been able to further reduce our operational structure that was needed to support our improvement initiatives.", "This reorganization was just another step in our progression. We believe these changes will help us weather the current economic environment and enable us to emerge from an economic downturn as an even stronger company and poised for growth. Unfortunately, this reorganization has resulted in a lot of really great people having to leave our company. These folks worked hard to put us in the position we're in today, to be able to take the next steps in our progression.", "I want to thank each of them for all of their efforts and dedications, while they were on our team. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.", "Robert G. Simpson", "Thank you Larry.", "I'd like to start out by discussing SG&A costs. These costs increased $11 million to $382 million during the fourth quarter of 2008 versus the same quarter of 2007. This increase is due primarily to expenditures on our business initiatives as well as a $3 million increase in bad debt expense. David and Larry both spoke about the restructuring plan and I would like to point out that our current estimate is at approximately 70% of the anticipated cost savings will be realized in the SG&A categories, leading to a sharp decline in SG&A costs. We believe this new level of SG&A will be able to support our business going forward even when the economy turns around and revenues grow.", "Depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter was essentially flat when compared with the fourth quarter of 2007. As a percentage of revenue, depreciation and amortization expense was 9.6%, compared with 8.8% in the prior year quarter primarily due to the decline in revenue. Interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2008, was $114 million, a $12 million decrease from the prior year period. This decrease is due primarily to the decline in interest rates, which impacts the interest expanse associated with our interest rate swaps and our variable rate debt. The floating portion for our debt portfolio was 33% at the end of the quarter, and our debt to total capital ratio was 58.5%.", "Moving to income taxes, in our press release, we noted a $6 million benefit to net income in the fourth quarter of 2008. This benefit results primarily from favorable tax audit settlements. In the fourth quarter of 2008, our effective tax rate adjusted for this benefit was approximately 38.4%. This rate reflects the utilization of state net operating loss and credit carry forwards. We highlighted in our press release, a $16 million non-cash charge to net income that arises solely due to interest rate used in our accounting calculation of the present value of our environmental remediation obligations. The discount rate used is the tenure treasury rate, which dropped during the quarter from 4% to 2.25%.", "Turning to cash flow fourth quarter 2008 net cash provided by operating activities, increased to $673 million, a 13.5% improvement over the prior year period. We've benefited from favorable working capital results in the fourth quarter, some of which will reverse in the first quarter of 2009. Our capital expenditures for the quarter were about $430 million and our free cash flow for the quarter was $259 million. We paid $132 million in dividends in the quarter; we have not purchased any shares since early July, but for the year we have returned over $940 million in cash to our shareholders through our share repurchases and cash dividend payments.", "Since the beginning of 2004, we have returned to our shareholders almost $6.5 billion, reflecting their confidence in our company's strength, and consistent cash generating ability, our Board of Directors has approved a capital allocation program for 2009, authorizing the expenditure of up to $1.3 billion in combined cash dividends, common stock purchases, debt reduction and acquisitions.", "We currently expect approximately $575 million will be dedicated to dividend payments in 2009, reflecting the Board's stated intention to raise our quarterly dividend pay up by 7.4% to $1.16 per share per year resulting in a current yield of over 4%.", "To give you some additional guidance on our plans for 2009 we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $1.2 billion and we intend to spend most of the capital in the second of the half the year. Our capital spending is flexible and can be adjusted if circumstances warrant. After capital expenditures we have targeted our full year free cash flow to be in the range of $1.3 to $1.4 billion. We currently forecast total interest expense for 2009 of about $450 million. This estimate include in a number of assumptions. We assumed an overall average borrowing rate of 5.9%. We also assumed that 90 day LIBOR rises during the course of the year ultimately to 2.5% by year-end. We plan to issue a new senior debt to replace maturities in 2009. And we also note that 2008 full year interest expense benefited approximately $24 million from the favorable impact of terminated interest rate swaps that will not reoccur.", "We expect an effective tax rate in 2009 of 40%, excluding the effective any tax audit settlements. We wanted to give you as much detail as we could around our expectations for 2009. However, we're not giving specific guidance around revenue and earnings per share. Given the dramatic changes in the economy, we think it is prudent hold off until we see how the year is going. Certainly, we expect to first quarter to be week and we expect to see improvement in the economy by the end of year, but the recent volatility makes it difficult to estimate the timing of the improvement.", "Again regardless of the economy, we will manage the business to continue our strong cash generation and when the economy gets better, we will poised to leverage our reduced cost structure to grow earnings and expand margins.", "Finally, as a company we are focused on improving return on invested capital for our shareholders. And our strategy is design to accomplish this. For the full year 2008, using the formula outlined in our long-term stock incentive plan, our return on invested capital stood at 16.3%, which is a 460 basis point improvement from the year-end 2004 level. This was accomplished despite a challenging economic environment through the fine efforts of our employees and we thank them for their dedication. And with that Nicole, let's open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Scott Levine with J. P. Morgan.", "Scott Levine - J. P. Morgan", "Good morning guys.", "David Steiner", "Good morning Scott", "Scott Levine - J. P. Morgan", "It sounded in the introductory commentary that the weakness that you're seeing in the business that picked up in the fourth quarter is kind of relegated to the industrial segment but you weren't seeing much slippage on the commercial side as yet. What are your expectations there, as it's generally kind of lagged the economy, and/or what are your expectations anecdotally with regards to the volume and/or price trends in the commercial business specifically as we move in and through 2009?", "David Steiner", "Yeah, I think Scott, what you see here, really is a tale of two companies. And we're very encouraged by what we see in the commercial line both from a volume and a price point of view. I mean it shows the recession resistant nature of our commercial business. Now, we certainly don't expect to see improvement in commercial volumes, but we don't expect to see significant deterioration either, that gives you an opportunity to make sure that you're getting good price. And as you all know, the success that we've had over the last few years has been driven primarily by our pricing program and we continue to... we intend to continue that focus in 2009.", "Scott Levine - J. P. Morgan", "I'm thinking about maybe what were the incremental, if there is incremental volume weakness, is it really a broadening out in the industrial segment beyond call it the housing driven lines of business, where you expect to see that incremental weakness, not on the commercial side, is that an accurate?", "David Steiner", "I think that's safe to say, I think all across the temporarily roll-off lines of business, we're seeing weakness.", "Scott Levine - J. P. Morgan", "And the permanent roll-offs, that's still holding up relatively well?", "David Steiner", "Permanent roll-off should hold up, should act a little bit more like the commercial line of business, it should be fairly recession resistance. It will have a little bit more because of the lowered manufacturing statistics you see, but it did should hold up, it's not going to act like temporary roll-off, it's not going to act like commercial, it's going to be somewhere in between.", "Scott Levine - J. P. Morgan", "Somewhere in the middle, got it. And then turning to pricing, so core pricing decelerate 60 basis points quarter-on-quarter, but I guess the interpretation as well as the cost inflation is easing. So, if we think about... if we think about pricing and the expectations there, you said you expect 50 to 100 basis points above the rate of cost inflation. So, would an accurate conclusion be that you're not expecting any deceleration if you'll in that spread 50 to 100 basis points versus what we're seeing caught in 2008 and maybe in 2007?", "Lawrence O\u2019Donnell, III", "I think we're talking about... we're talking about core CPI, fuel was not in that component.", "Scott Levine - J. P. Morgan", "Right. So you're still thinking, core... core pricing can remain 50 to 100 bits above cost inflation, is that roughly equivalent to what you saw in 2008 ex-fuel?", "David Steiner", "Well, actually we saw a little bit better performance than that in 2008, and frankly we're going to, when we looked at it, you hit the nail right on the head, you see a 50 basis point decrease, now a lot of that is driven by things like lower rates and some things like that to drive our yield calculations. But we said we need to make sure that we keep these 50 to 100 basis points above core CPI number and that's why we put a stake in the ground by saying if we don't do it, no one's going to make their... get their annual bonus.", "Scott Levine - J. P. Morgan", "Got you. So, really looking at from spread perspective, you guys aren't expecting any real slippage on price?", "David Steiner", "Absolutely not.", "Scott Levine - J. P. Morgan", "Okay. One last one, if I could, and you are not giving EPS guidance but you did give some operating cash flow guidance in the press release. Are there any unusual developments '09 versus '08 on some of the non-cash items like kind of operating cash flow that we should be thinking about or is everything kind of consistent, roughly speaking with 2008?", "Lawrence O\u2019Donnell, III", "I would expect to continue to see some improvement in our management of working capital even in a tough environment, but I don't expect that to be a significant driver, so I would say it would be pretty consistent. Although the timing of the working capital, we had such a working capital benefit at the end of the fourth quarter.", "Scott Levine - J. P. Morgan", "Yes.", "Lawrence O\u2019Donnell, III", "That you could see that reverse a little bit in the first quarter. But overall I think you'll see consistent performance.", "Scott Levine - J. P. Morgan", "That's right. Great. Thanks. Nice quarter.", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "Lawrence O\u2019Donnell, III", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Wonderlich Securities.", "Michael Hoffman - Wonderlich Securities", "Hi guys.", "David Steiner", "Hello Michael.", "Lawrence O\u2019Donnell, III", "Hi Michael.", "Robert Simpson", "Hi Michael.", "Michael Hoffman - Wonderlich Securities", "Hi. So, I apologies, if you have said some of this in your prep, I was scribbling away, I may have missed some of this. Timing of the 50 million and cost for the reorg, are we going to see that all in the first quarter, is it spread, can you give us a sense of sort of how we should model that? Second, are you going to show that as an extraordinary, even if it's a non-GAAP extraordinary adjustment, so we can pull it out?", "Robert Simpson", "I would expect that the vast majority of it will be in the first quarter, there maybe some that will go beyond as we just we make some other adjustments in facilities and leased obligations and the like but the vast majority will be in the first quarter, the vast majority has already incurred. We'll give some more and clear numbers on that when we get to the first quarter earnings call in April and I would expect we'll treat the restructuring charge as we call it, I expect we'll treat it as something we would exclude from ongoing earnings or as-adjusted earnings. Now there is a line in our income statement referred to as restructuring expenses and that's where you'll find it.", "Michael Hoffman - Wonderlich Securities", "Okay. And that, your 1.3 to 1.4 assumes data has a cash impact as well.", "Lawrence O\u2019Donnell, III", "The 1.3 to 1.4...", "Robert Simpson", "Yeah, I would expect that would include the 50 million in it.", "Michael Hoffman - Wonderlich Securities", "Okay. And then the 100 million in savings, conversely, how quickly do we get to model in the adjustment on a year-over-year basis?", "Robert Simpson", "Well, the $100 million savings is the savings we expected to see in current year and 70% of that would go to SG&A.", "Michael Hoffman - Wonderlich Securities", "And I mean if you've taken the impact on the cost side in the first quarter, does that mean by the second quarter, I am seeing a 100% impact of that 70% in SG&A?", "Lawrence O\u2019Donnell, III", "Very nearly.", "Robert Simpson", "Very nearly, yes.", "Michael Hoffman - Wonderlich Securities", "Okay, all right. So, that's the speed is what I'm trying to get at.", "Robert Simpson", "Yeah.", "Michael Hoffman - Wonderlich Securities", "Do you have an exposure to the Smurfit bankruptcy in your receivables?", "Robert Simpson", "Very, very little exposure, it's less than a million dollars.", "Michael Hoffman - Wonderlich Securities", "Okay. And then when it's regards to receivables, I heard you say something about bad debt allowances being up 3 million. So I'm assuming your DSOs start to lengthen a little bit, that's a challenge to working capital improvements, is this sort of. I'd like to hear what you're doing and in those regards, and how you contain that?", "David Steiner", "Our DSO is even through the fourth quarter continued to improve. And I would expect to see pressure on that. We just haven't seen that yet and when we're through our revenue management center which is located in Phoenix working with... our centralized center working with the market areas, we've been pretty good at identifying problem customers and getting with them quickly to get paid. So, and we've got like a special watch on our... some of our customers who have troubled financials and work with them very closely to make sure we continue to paid. So, like... will that have an impact, I would expect so, but I am thinking we'll be able to manage that fairly well.", "Michael Hoffman - Wonderlich Securities", "Okay. And than I don't want to get carried away with this, but the yellow sheet is showing a little bit of recovery in OCC, nothing in OMP. Are you getting any of the benefit of that into the extraordinary drop in November, starting to recover seeing in the first quarter on those recycling sign?", "Lawrence O\u2019Donnell, III", "Yes, it's definitely better now than it was when the bottom fell out. Certainly the export rates on the coast are higher than what we're seeing in the Midwest and in the Southeast, but we have seen some improvements.", "David Steiner", "But remember, Michael you have three month of the down cycle for the first quarter when we only had two months in the fourth quarter. So we would expect sort of a similar effect that we saw on the fourth quarter, in the first quarter even though pricing is coming is back, we got lower pricing for the full quarter. So we'd expect about the same impact that we saw on the fourth quarter.", "Michael Hoffman - Wonderlich Securities", "Okay. And then I'm assuming some of the rebate you've had to do all that what was rolling itself backwards as well. So, I mean are you able to put search charge in for commodities where you had contractual relationships about sharing the load here?", "Lawrence O\u2019Donnell, III", "Yeah, we're actually now going back and looking at our whole pricing model. What we want to make sure we're doing is getting paid for our processing cost and put ourselves in a position to get an adequate return on our capital investment. So, we're taking a whole new look at the rebate structure in total.", "Michael Hoffman - Wonderlich Securities", "Okay. You may have said this and I missed. Is there intent for share repurchase in the count of your free cash flow and your dividend guidance?", "David Steiner", "Yes Michel, when we put the press release out in December on this point, we wanted to emphasize the point we've been making a long time which is the portion of the free cash flow that we put into our capital allocation program that is not going to dividends can be used in a number of different ways, now in the past we've focused on share repurchases but in this environment we're also going to focus on liquidity levels and liquidity issues as well as focus on the acquisition opportunity. So as we get through end of the year, we see how the liquidity is holding up and whether we can...our debt refinancing, we've got coming up happen in accordance with we'd like see then we'll make a decision about share repurchases. In the meantime, we're interested in some acquisitions, we're not going to risk our balance sheet for acquisitions but certainly like to be in a position to make acquisitions as well.", "Michael Hoffman - Wonderlich Securities", "And I am assuming that some of the fear of a rising capital gains tax, you're seeing a lot of companies might not have been sellers, thinking about selling now?", "David Steiner", "I think Michael, that you'll see that happen throughout the year. Not only the capital gains stack, but I think people has starting to realize that they're not going to get the multiples that they were expecting a couple of years ago. So when we look at 2009 from an acquisition point of view, we're going to be opportunistic, we're going to take advantage of opportunities where we see them. But we're also going to be disciplined, I mean, we're not going to change just like we did in 2008. We're going to make sure that whatever we do we don't risk our balance sheet. And so, and clearly they will gravitate more towards tuck-in acquisitions than any large acquisitions.", "Michael Hoffman - Wonderlich Securities", "Okay. And then two more, just quickly. We elaborate, how do we book, and one, when is the time some of the benefit of Frederick County, and how do we book that in impact to the income statement or is there no income statement impact until it goes live in 2014?", "David Steiner", "Yes, there is virtually no income statement or balance sheet that impact until close to when it goes live in 2014. That's the point... that's the great thing about these Wheelabrator projects is that, if we had to put up a lot of capital here this would not be a good time to be going into waste energy projects. Most of those projects, we don't put up any of the capital because they're financed by the public authority. But if in the event that we do have to put up capital, you're looking at, at least two, three, four years out before you have to worry about that. Certainly, we all expect that within three or four years the capital market will be in a little bit different position than they are today.", "Michael Hoffman - Wonderlich Securities", "Okay. And then the last one deflation, in a deflationary environment where year are coupled with slow growth, how do you handle pricing as a best practice and a behavior in 2010?", "David Steiner", "We only talk about 50 to 100 basis point above core CPI. If in fact we get into a deflationary environment, there is only one thing I am certain of. We will do better than 50 to 100 basis point above core CPI because we don't have any intention seeing our pricing program go back to where it's running in the 1 to 2% range. And so what we've seen in our business is that we can get those price increases at 50 to 100 basis points above core CPI but we're never going to let them drop sort of below that 1% to 2% range like they did in the early 2000.", "Michael Hoffman - Wonderlich Securities", "Alright, thank you so much.", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Steinberg with Goldman Sachs.", "David Steinberg - Goldman Sachs", "Good morning.", "David Steiner", "Good morning.", "Lawrence O\u2019Donnell, III", "Hello David.", "David Steinberg - Goldman Sachs", "Hi. A few follow ups to first round of questions. In terms of the M&A opportunities you addressed individual were smaller carters or mom and pops that might be coming, or sorry, private companies that might be coming for sale. Any comments on pending sales from Republic Services and what you may or may not be bidding on? We heard about one block of businesses they went out of the door earlier this week?", "David Steiner", "Yes. Certainly we will take look at all the assets that have become available and will respond accordingly.", "David Steinberg - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Even talked to... well out of what's left I am assuming then is, have you looked and is there anything you are interested in?", "David Steiner", "You know we really haven't taken a good hard look at it, obviously we're interested in any asset that we can get at a fair price but for whatever reason they've chosen, Republic has decided to exclude us from a portion of that process.", "David Steinberg - Goldman Sachs", "Understood. David you talked about a November trends being worst in October and December being worst than November, albeit at an improving rate. Any early indication on how January shaped up?", "David Steiner", "January shaped up pretty similar to December. We saw, and again you really have to look at this, as I think this quarter in particular showed us the dramatic difference between our recession resistant lines and our economically sensitive lines. In the recession resistant lines we have seen a fairly stable situation with volumes, in a couple of those months we actually saw volumes going up, and so you don't see the volumes reacting dramatically in those lines of business. But in the economically sensitive lines like our C&D, special waste and the landfill primarily roll off in collection line of business, we saw that dramatic drop-off in October to November and then fairly similar drop offs in December and January. And that's frankly why we've chosen not to try to peg a revenue number for 2009.", "I think the question on everybody's mind, no matter what company you are in, is when are these volumes going to trough, and in past years we've always had a pretty good idea on that, I'm not sure but that with state of the economy right now that anyone has that kind of idea. So, rather than put a number out there that reflects the current trends, we certainly expect those trends to get better during the course of the year, as Bob said, it's just difficult to determine when they are going to get better.", "David Steinberg - Goldman Sachs", "As a follow up of there, I think Scott, had touched on this in his questions. It's a little counter intuitive to me, how your commercial business is recession resistant. We hear about small businesses suffering and from a real estate (ph) team, how real estate vacancy ratio increasing, so I would think they commercial volumes would start to fall off albeit maybe on a lagging basis, but it seems from your comments that has not happened. Is that your expectation that as this slow economic period plays out that the commercial is the next leg to fall off, is that how we should think about it or in fact you expect it to hold up throughout?", "David Steiner", "Yeah. Well remember, when we say they haven't fallen off, they are running at negative 4%, so it's not like they're positive, right. But certainly you would expect to see a little bit of weakening there as businesses close down, but in both the residential and the commercial side, you also have the benefit of less waste if you have a fixed price for the customer and they but less waste in their bin you actually are benefited by that, right. And so, what we've seen in the commercial line is certainly a drop-off but not a dramatic drop-off like we've seen in the economic sensitive lines. Could that get incrementally worse, I'm sure it could. But what I'm saying is that what we saw in November, December, January which was fairly dramatic in the economic sensitive line was not dramatic at all in the commercial line. Now could I get it incrementally worse during the course of the year, I think you're absolutely right, it could. But we don't see it getting worse in the same manner that we see the economically sensitive portion to get worse.", "David Steinberg - Goldman Sachs", "Great and one follow up question for Bob in terms of the cash flow outlook. Again, a follow-up to Scott's question, I think you had said that the working capital would provide a little bit of a benefit here in '09, I guess my question is on D&A and that other line that you lumped together, other historically it's jumped around, any expectations in terms of what the cash flow from operations would be from those other items? And D&A has been trending down overtime, but here in the fourth quarter was flat on a dollar basis year-over-year, your thoughts on those two items in '09?", "Robert Simpson", "I would expect the D&A to continue to at about the comparables to the levels you've seen over the last year with the exception that if landfill volumes continue to stay low, we might see a little bit decline in the D&A, because there is a significant portion of it relates to the amortization expense per ton that we take in as with landfills. And with the other... I don't think that was a big item in 2008 and I don't expect it to be any different in 2009.", "David Steinberg - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Maybe I was confused, I know we'll get more details on this in your 10-K filing, but I think it was over $390 million of cash flow from that those other lines?", "Robert Simpson", "That's probably just the change, that was I think the working capital adjustment, so it would fall through there.", "David Steinberg - Goldman Sachs", "I'm sorry. I'm flipping through the press release. I' had seen changes in operating assets and liabilities net of effects negative 89 million. The other 339 is going to include working capital then?", "Robert Simpson", "Yes, that's right.", "David Steinberg - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. So, then I misread it. Thanks for the clarity.", "Robert Simpson", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ellis with Merrill Lynch.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks and good morning guys.", "Robert Simpson", "Good morning", "David Steiner", "Good morning Jonathan.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Why don't you, you touched on potential acquisitions and use of cash flow. Can you talk a little bit about, are those acquisitions primarily in your solid waste business or the ancillary businesses, talk a little bit about your acquisition pipeline this year?", "David Steiner", "Yes, in fact we're getting our business developers together in the next week to talk just about that. Because obviously there going to be opportunities in solid waste and we want to make sure we take advantage of those. But we do think there will be a lot of opportunities in ancillary businesses. For example, I noticed that you wrote a report about medical waste yesterday, certainly that would be an area where we'd be looking to make opportunistic acquisitions. And so we're not going to limit ourselves to solid waste. We're going to be looking at ancillary businesses. We're going to be looking at waste-to-energy opportunities. We're going to make sure that if the right opportunity presents itself, that we're in a position financially to take advantage of it.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. And Bob, just on the debt maturity that's come in May, based on what you know, and seeing the credit markets right now, is your expectation that you will be able to refinance that and as of right now you're not planning to pay that bond down?", "Robert Simpson", "That's our expectation, yes.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Just turning your attention to the quarter very briefly, I think if I caught this correctly, you talked about MSW pricing at the landfill but I didn't hear you provide an overall pricing figure for disposal this quarter?", "Robert Simpson", "Yeah, the overall price for disposal was positive 0.2%.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay.", "David Steiner", "When we look at disposal pricing frankly where we focus on is MSW, special waste is job specific, it can...there is a huge mix element in there and then C&D there is obviously a geographical element in there. And so it's sort of hard to make a determination on overall pricing strategy based on with those two lines. MSW is a line that, that is fairly homogenous throughout the country, so you don't have those types of mix issue. So, when we focus on pricing at the landfill, we focus on MSW, the target that I talked about will focus on MSW. But don't you have a (ph) target for annual bonus, we'll focus on MSW.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And just since you brought that up, will you be willing to disclose what those minimum thresholds are for those in terms of yield?", "David Steiner", "Yeah, we were in the process of putting those together as we speak, we're going to put those together, market area by market area. As you can imagine there are differences in market areas where some should do better than others. But we're in the process of putting those together, market area by market area. So, I can promise you they will be aggressive, aggressive but achievable targets, but we haven't set those target for the market area yet. Once we set those then we'll know how they roll up for the groups and for the cooperation.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. Just on... from a pricing standpoint, can you just walk through very briefly both on the collection of landfill side, what portion of your contract grade base at this point has not been reprised over the last few years?", "Robert Simpson", "I think we've been through most... very little of it hasn't been reprised at this point.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. So even amongst should I know in particularly on the landfill contracts, I mean that was the area that...", "Robert Simpson", "I'm sorry, I thought you were taking about... collections, yeah. Landfill we still save up some long term contracts that will be coming due sometime during year that we haven't touched yet, but on the collection side, I think that that's been, we've certainly been through the business improvement process and there are still some national accounts we're working with, but I think that's not very much anymore. I think we've been through that and we're continuing on with them, it's not like that was a one time project.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Sure. Would you be able to give us just based on kind of what you've been accomplish thus far, what type of price increase you may expect at those, of those landfill contracts as they come up, again just based on what you've been able to accomplish historically?", "Unidentified Analyst", "Well, what we've seen in the last few years is that pricing has run somewhere between 5 and 10%, the repricing of the landfill business probably in excess of that, when we repriced residential bids and we don't expect to back down from that.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. Thanks a lot guys.", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "Robert Simpson", "Thank you.", "David Steiner", "David, let me just quickly mention, David Steinberg asked about the other item in the cash flow statement and I was, I was not following, did not get a chance to look. And David the biggest single item in that is deferred taxes and we don't expect that to change drastically in the coming year. Thanks. So, on the call we can move on.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Fisher with Raymond James.", "William Fisher - Raymond James", "Good morning.", "David Steiner", "Good morning.", "Robert Simpson", "Good morning.", "William Fisher - Raymond James", "Just a David a follow up on just minimum yield targets, it sounds like its major focused, can you just give some color on how you factor in if you see some more volume offset as a result of those or how you balance those to in that instead of comp?", "David Steiner", "Yeah, we have very consistently said that you could loose 3 to 5% of your volume if you get 1% price and that is the mantra that we're going to follow at Waste Management. When you look at again, I think its interesting to look at the volumes in the fourth quarter and to see that even in a quarter where I certainly haven't seen in my lifetime a quarter that was, that was worst than the fourth quarter, although we might be living in one right now. Hopefully, that will end soon. But even at that point in time, in a bad economy you saw the volumes on the commercial side hold up very well. So, I don't know why we would be less aggressive in pricing there and so when we look at those targets again, what we're going to do, we don't want to put out targets and this is going to be 100% of the annual bonus for the senior leadership team and 70% of the annual bonus for all of our folks out in the field and so you want to make that target achievable but aggressive.", "William Fisher - Raymond James", "Okay, great, thanks. And actually this is for Bob. Just want to clarify the 100 million in savings that is going to be roughly 100% realized in the year.", "Robert Simpson", "Yes.", "William Fisher - Raymond James", "Okay. And kind of (inaudible) but then you mentioned you have the obviously, the interest rates going up a fair bit in your forecast. And you mentioned three month LIBOR, can you use one month LIBOR? It's obviously a lot lower than three months right now.", "Robert Simpson", "I guess we would look into that. I think right now our swaps are in place already and they are based off at 90 day LIBOR.", "Unidentified Analyst", "The swaps are based on 90, we can borrow under our revolver using 30 and we did do that at the end of 2008. But right now we are in a 90 day LIBOR traunch (ph) even under our revolver.", "William Fisher - Raymond James", "Okay, great. Thanks very much.", "Robert Simpson", "Thanks Bill.", "Operator", "And we have one final question. Your final question comes from Nicole Deblase from Deutsche Bank.", "Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning.", "David Steiner", "Good morning.", "Robert Simpson", "Good morning Nicole.", "Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank", "First of all on pricing, you guys sounded pretty confident that you won't see pricing dip around 1% pricing that you saw during the last downturn. So if we're in a deflationary to flat CPI environment this year, what gives you confidence that you can see more than the 50 to 100 bits spread?", "David Steiner", "Yeah, I mean it basically comes down to again, it's the beauty of this business. The recession resistant nature of this business. There is not, Sherry Rice likes to say that if you put shoes on sale people are going to buy more shoes. But if you put waste services on sale, people aren't necessarily going to buy more waste services. There is a finite level of demand and there is a, the amount demand is not going to reduce dramatically if you raise prices. And so it's a simple matter of looking at the elasticity of demand and you... in this... when you have a necessary product like our product is in a commercial line of businesses and in our recession resistant businesses, when you have a necessary product, you're always going to better raising price and taking the volume loss because the elasticity of demand is always going to work in your favor. And so, that's basically what our pricing programs are built around, they're built around a fundamental premise, that the elasticity of demand is always going to pay you better if you raise prices and take the volume loss. And so, we are going to continue that in 2009. The good news is, is that, from a return on capital point of view. I think this entire industry has understood that when you look at return on capital you have to look at it from a pricing point of view and that's, so I think we've also seen the pricing hold up very well throughout the country. So, we're going to continue with the program of, letting less the elasticity of demand work in our favor and that's not going to change whether it's a deflationary environment or an inflationary environment.", "Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And I understand that but I mean you are saying that is, if it's deflationary that you can get more than a 100 bit spread, correct?", "David Steiner", "Correct. In another words, if we have deflation, so core CPI is negative we will not go to negative pricing.", "Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, okay, got it. And then what are you guys seeing in the competitive pricing environment?", "David Steiner", "Yes, I mean, it's what I've said before, we have seen it holding up fairly well across the country, I think there is a lot of factors that come into play there, obviously with fuel coming down, I think that that's been a benefit. And so, we've seen pricing, it's basically the same that we've seen over the last few years. You see a fairly solid pricing environment with pockets of unusual behavior.", "Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Sir, there no further questions at this time.", "David Steiner", "Well thank you all for joining us. We certainly know that 2009 is going to be a challenging year. We certainly expect to meet those challenges and we look forward to a great year, filled with opportunities and another great strong year of generating free cash that we can return to our shareholders. Thank you all for joining us.", "Operator", "Thank you for participating in today's Waste Management conference call.

My name is Nicole and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Waste Management First Quarter 2009 Earnings Release. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Thank you.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Alderson, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin your conference.", "Jim Alderson", "Thank you, Nicole. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. With me this morning are David Steiner, Chief Executive Officer; Larry O'Donnell, President and Chief Operating Officer and Bob Simpson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "David will start things off with a summary of the financial results for the quarter and a review of the details of our revenue growth, including price and volume trends. Larry will discuss operating costs and Bob will cover the financial statements. We will conclude with questions-and-answers.", "Before we started let me remind you that in addition to our press release that was issued this morning, we have filed a Form 8-K that includes the press release as an attachment and is available on our website at www.wm.com the press release and schedule to the release include important information that you should refer to. That is because during these discussions of our first quarter 2009 results of operations, we will be providing estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.", "These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that are described in detail in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, and in our press release this morning. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.", "During the course of the presentation, we also will discuss certain financial measures on an as-adjusted basis, just as we have presented them in our press release this morning. These measures include net income, earnings per share, income from operations, operating expenses and certain operating margins, all adjusted for items we deem unusual or non-operational in nature. We will also discuss free cash flow, all of these are non-GAAP financial measures.", "When David, Larry and Bob discuss the results we've presented in our press release on an as-adjusted basis, their comments will also be on an as-adjusted basis. Specifically, these adjustments include, a $23 million reduction in net income due to charges related to the restructuring announced in February 2009, and a $30 million reduction in net income related to the abandonment of the SAP software.", "When David discusses internal revenue growth volumes, these volumes will be adjusted to reflect one less workday during the first quarter of 2009 compared to the prior year period. We have given detailed information on all of the non-GAAP measures that will be discussed on this morning's call and have reconciled them to the most comparable GAAP measures, and you can find that information in the schedules to the earnings press release or on the Form 8-K filed today which, as I mentioned, can be found on the Company's website at www.wm.com.", "This call will be recorded and will be available 24 hours a day beginning approximately 1 PM Eastern Time today until 5 PM Eastern Time on May 13. To hear a replay of the call over the Internet, access the Waste Management website, at www.wm.com. To hear a telephonic replay of the call, dial 800-642-1687 and enter reservation code 90934084.", "Time sensitive information given during the course of today's call, which is occurring on April 29, 2009, may no longer be accurate at the time of the replay. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of Waste Management is prohibited.", "Now I turn the call over to Waste Management's CEO, David Steiner.", "David Steiner", "Thank you, Jim. Good morning from Houston. I'm pleased with the high level of performance throughout our organization in the first quarter. We faced significant challenges as the volume declines and the drop in commodity prices that occurred in Q4 2008 continued into the first quarter. In the face of these challenges we still posted solid financial results and our strong cash generating abilities were proven once again.", "We earned $0.42 per share in 2009's first quarter. As we expected, for the first quarter of 2009, there was a negative impact of $0.09 per diluted share from our recycling operation. So, if we further adjust Q1 2009 for the impact of our recycling operations to make the quarter more comparable to 2008, we would have earned $0.51 in the first quarter 2009. This would be an increase of $0.04 per diluted share, or over 8.5% when compared with our adjusted first quarter 2008 results.", "In a slow economy, this is a significant achievement, and it's evidence that our pricing and operational excellence program continue to function well.", "Looking at revenue, revenue declined by $456 million in the first quarter, but most of the decline was a result of items that do not relate to the core collection and disposal operations. $202 million of the decline was due to recycling commodity revenues and energy prices. $35 million related to foreign currency exchange. $64 million related to the decline in fuel surcharge revenues as oil prices declined. And $23 million related to having one fewer workday in the quarter. This leaves a first quarter 2009 revenue decline related to our core solid waste collection and disposal business of only $132 million, or 4.7% of revenue.", "Looking at internal revenue growth, we're modifying the method we use to calculate internal revenue growth in order to get a truer picture of our pricing program. The old calculation didn't clearly reflect pricing in our core business because it included revenue from other parts of our business. So, for example, in calculating yield under the prior method for our solid waste business, which includes collection and disposal lines, the numerator would include only price changes for the collection and disposal line, but denominator would include revenue from recycling, electricity, fuel surcharges and other non related businesses.", "The new method only includes pricing and revenue that is related to that particular line of business. We've included exhibit 1 in our press release to show the calculation under both methods, but we will refer to the new method going forward. We believe our new method will give a better picture of how our pricing programs are working in each of our lines of business. So, internal revenue growth from collection and disposal yield in the first quarter was 3.1%.", "Internal revenue growth from yield was strongest in the three collection lines of business. Combined, the revenue growth from yield of the industrial, commercial, and residential lines of our collection business was 3.9% in the first quarter. We produced our strongest results in our commercial collection line of business, where internal revenue growth from yield was 4.2% in the quarter. The yield components of internal revenue growth in our industrial and residential lines of business were both 3.6%.", "In February, we announced we were setting minimum pricing targets for each of our areas, groups, and the company. We still have our normal bonus program based on margins and EBITDA, but the pricing target acts as a gate that has to be met to get into the bonus pool. If we don't meet the pricing targets, senior management will not receive an annual bonus, even if we meet our margin and EBITDA target. These price targets are based upon increases to revenue per unit, which reflect core pricing changes. The targets were set insure that we maintain our focus on pricing and continue to achieve yield at a level 50 to 100 basis points above core CPI.", "For the first quarter of 2009, the company met its pricing target, which is reflected in our strong yield results. We will continue to pursue pricing opportunities and believe we can continue to meet our 2009 pricing goals. Internal revenue growth from volumes declined 7.4% in the quarter. The recession resistant lines of our business, namely commercial and residential collection, saw volume declines similar to what we had seen throughout 2008, at about negative 4% each. But in our more economically sensitive lines of business we did see a decline as roll-off volumes fell 14.5%. However, we maintained our focus on roll-off pricing, which resulted in revenue growth from yield of 3.6% for the quarter. We continued to work to obtain price increases in our roll-off line despite lower volumes, and certainly we will continue that strategy in 2009.", "So overall, income from operations continued to increase in the collection line of business. Income from operations increased 2% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period of 2008, and our income from operations margin in our collection business expanded by 260 basis points.", "Turning to yield and volume on the disposal side of the business, third party volumes at our landfills dropped 11.5% compared to the prior year period. The largest declines occurred in a more economically sensitive special waste in C and D line. The landfill volumes were somewhat lower than we expected, but they appear to have stabilized during the quarter. Given the lower volumes, we will continue our focus on pricing and flexing our costs to obtain an appropriate return on capital in this capital intensive business.", "On the pricing front, for the quarter our internal revenue growth from landfill yield was 1.7% and was 2.3% on MSW. Again, we will maintain our focus on disposal pricing despite the lower volumes. The recycling markets have shown extreme volatility over the last six months, and our earnings have suffered because some of our contracts are not designed to cover our processing costs when commodity prices reach low levels. We do not intend to seek financial hedges for commodities, but we can create a natural hedge by changing the way that we contract for volumes.", "Let me explain how. Currently, most of our contracts do not have a minimum charge for processing recyclables. Rather they call for the sharing of revenues from the sale of the recyclables. If our share of the revenue is below our processing cost we lose money. In some of our contracts we've offered a guaranteed floor for commodity prices to our customers. If commodity prices are below the floor, again, we lose money. Consequently, we're work on revising our pricing and rebate model in our recycling operations. We will not offer floor pricing to our customers.", "New contract pricing will also include a fee to cover our processing costs plus a fair return on our capital. When commodity prices exceed our processing costs, we would be willing to share a portion of the upside with our customers. It will take time to affect these changes with existing contracted customers but these pricing structure changes will help to ensure the long-term viability of our recycling operation by making them less exposed to cyclical markets.", "On the cost side, the companywide reorganization we announced in February was implemented without skipping a beat, and will produce annualized savings in excess of $120 million. Larry will give you further details in his remarks. So, we're poised to have a strong year despite the poor economy. Volumes in our residential and commercial line continue to run at a stable rate, showing their recession resistant qualities. In our more economically sensitive roll-off and landfill lines we've seen volumes flatten sequentially over the last few months and we expect to see volumes up tick over the next few months as a result of seasonality.", "However, until we see the size of the seasonal up tick it's still too early to predict what volumes will do for the remainder of the year. But regardless of how our volumes trend for the remainder of 2009 I want to reassure you three things that I said in February. First, we've taken the actions necessary to reduce our cost structure by over $120 million. And our field operations teams have the tools to continue to flex costs. They also have the equipment to handle volumes when they begin to grow again without adding significant new costs. So when volumes return, the leverage will be significant.", "Second, we will maintain our focus on growing revenue from yield in our collection and disposal lines. We've demonstrated our resolve by tying annual bonuses to the achievement of specific pricing targets, and so far this year we've exceeded our target.", "And third, we're very mindful of our investors' focus on cash generation, and we will ensure that we manage our capital in a manner that produces strong free cash flow. We had some carryover capital from 2008 that affected cash flow in Q1 2009, but overall, our capital expenditures for the year should still be in the $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion range. Leading to free cash flow of between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion for the year.", "Finally, we do see a stronger acquisition pipeline in 2009 as valuation and prices for assets reach lower levels. There are opportunities in the core solid waste business and in other strategic businesses such as waste to energy and medical waste. These strategic business opportunities allow to us grow revenues in our more recession resistant lines of business. So, in the next 12 to 18 months we would expect to spend up to $250 million of solid waste acquisitions, up to $200 million in waste and energy investment, up to $200 million in medical waste acquisitions.", "Generally, we would fund any acquisitions out of free cash flow, so we will maintain our solid balance sheet. Where he think these types of opportunities will position us solidly to weather this economic downturn and to emerge stronger and poised for growth. We will also look for longer-term opportunities that would start construction in the three to five year time horizon in the waste to energy business as we bid on projects both domestically and internationally. So, we're excited by the opportunities we see and believe they will set the stage for a bright future.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Larry who will review our operating cost results.", "Larry O'Donnell", "Thank you, David. Good morning. I will begin by reviewing our operating cost results for the first quarter 2009 after which I will discuss our restructuring.", "Operating expenses in the first quarter of 2009 were $1.725 billion, or 61.4% of revenue an improvement of $367 million from the first quarter 2008, or 270 basis points as a percent of revenue. This is a strong performance given the decline in revenue.", "The cost reduction is due primarily to four factors. First, flexing down costs and executing our restructuring plan. Second, lower recycling commodity prices, which result in lower rebates we pay to our customers. Third, lower fuel costs from the decline in diesel fuel prices. And fourth, the decline in the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar.", "Adjusting for the impacts of commodities and fuel on both our revenues and expenses, operating costs improved 140 basis points as a percent of revenue. We lowered first quarter 2009 operating costs in nine of the 10 cost categories that we break out in our financial statement.", "I'm pleased with the disciplined approach exhibited by our team in managing our controllable operating costs during tough economic conditions. We demonstrated the value of our operational excellence initiative by flexing down our costs in reaction to the current economic downturn.", "I will now review our performance for the first quarter of 2009 compared to the prior year period in a number of the cost categories. Labor and employee benefit costs improve by $37 million in the quarter. This improvement is the result primarily of reducing routes and improving asset efficiency in reaction to the volume decline, productivity improvements achieved in all three of our collection lines of business, as well as labor cost savings that resulted from our restructuring announced in February of this year.", "We reduced our driver hours by about 859,000 hours. Over 70% of this reduction was due to reducing our capacity by taking trucks off the road as volumes declined. In the remainder was primarily due to productivity improvement. Our total reportable injury rate was reduced to 3.1% in the first quarter, a 24.4% improvement compared to the prior year period. We're very pleased with this achievement, which demonstrates our leadership in protecting the health and safety of our employees and our community.", "Cost of goods sold decreased by $120 million, or 320 basis points as a percent of revenue. Principally due to the reduction of recycling commodity rebates. In January, we saw recycling commodity prices stabilize and begin to improve in February and March. We would expect recycling commodity prices to continue to improve moderately, and so the year-over-year loss would moderate in the second and third quarters and actually turn positive for the fourth quarter because of the easier fourth quarter year-over-year comps.", "Even if recycling commodity prices don't get any better than the March levels, we would expect to see a full year negative impact on earnings of about $0.20 per diluted share. Transfer and disposal expenses, which include those costs that our collection companies paid to third-party landfills and transfer stations, improved by $41 million, or almost 20 basis points as a percent of revenue, primarily due to volume declines.", "In addition, our internalization rate hit 70% in the quarter. We lowered our maintenance and repair costs in total by $10 million in the first quarter of 2009 compared with the prior year period. Collection and heavy equipment fleet maintenance improved by $16 million while the timing of our scheduled maintenance at some of our facilities partially offset some of this improvement. The efforts we've made to standardize our fleet and institute a cost effective preventive maintenance program continue to contribute to our improved operating costs.", "Compared to Q1 2008, falling diesel fuel prices lowered our direct fuel costs by approximately $55 million, and lowered indirect fuel costs charged to us by our subcontract transportation haulers by approximately $8 million. The change in fuel surcharge revenue closely matched the change in fuel cost during the first quarter 2009.", "Subcontractor costs improved by $47 million, or almost 60 basis points due to achieving fewer third-party contractors as a result of lower volumes and the decrease in indirect fuel costs passed on to us by our subcontract haulers.", "Landfill operating costs improved by $21 million in the first quarter 2009 compared with the prior year period. Primarily as a result of the accounting impact from the effect of higher interest rates on our remediation liability and as a result of operational improvements at our landfill.", "As mentioned by David, I want to give you an update on the restructuring of our operation that we announced in February. We incurred charges during the first quarter of approximately $38 million for this restructuring. The majority of this cost relates to employee severance. We expect to incur up to $15 million of additional restructuring costs in Q2 and Q3. We realize total cost savings of approximately $21 million for February and March, or about $10 million per month.", "Consequently, we expect the annualized savings from the restructuring to exceed $120 million. I would like to congratulate our entire team on the outstanding work they did implementing the reorganization plan. They achieved our objectives on time while maintaining our high standards of service to our customers. We spent several months putting together our restructuring plan, and it's gratifying to see how quickly and efficiently our organization executed the plan. It demonstrates to me how flexible our team has become and how well they all work together to continue to improve our company and our service to our customers in spite of the challenges from the current economic environment.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Bob.", "Bob Simpson", "Thank you, Larry. I like to start out by discussing SG&A costs. These costs decreased by $31 million to $337 million during first quarter of 2009 versus the same quarter 2008. This decrease is due primarily to labor cost savings that resulted from our restructuring announced in February of this year, lower long-term incentive plan expenses, and reductions in travel and entertainment partially offset by higher bad debt expense.", "David and Larry both spoke about the restructuring, and I would like to point out that approximately 70% of the restructuring cost savings in the first quarter were realized in SG&A categories. We believe this new level of SG&A will be able to support our business going forward, even when the economy turns around and volumes grow.", "Bad debt expense increased by $6 million for the quarter, approximately 40% of this increase comes from our recycling operations, largely as a result of bankruptcies by certain domestic paper companies. As we saw the economy weaken, we managed our receivables with these paper companies very closely and reduced our exposure by over 85% compared with the prior year period.", "We continued managing all of our receivables very closely and actually improved our day sales outstanding by almost one full day compared to the prior year period.", "Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter of 2009 declined $8 million when compared with the first quarter of 2008 principally as a result of lower landfill volumes. As a percent of revenue, depreciation and amortization expense was 10.3% compared with 9.1% in the prior year quarter, primarily due to the decline revenue.", "Interest expense for the first quarter was $105 million, a $17 million decrease from the prior year period. This decrease is due primarily to lower interest rates, which impact the interest expense associated with our interest rate swaps and our variable rate debt. Our debt to total capital ratio was 58.7%, and the floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 32% at the end of the quarter.", "We expect our floating rate percentage to drop under 30% in the second quarter when we pay our $500 million of notes due in May, which is fully swapped to floating.", "Moving to income taxes, for the first quarter of 2009, our effective tax rate was approximately 37.2%. We expect our effective rate for the full year to be 38.1%.", "During the first quarter we wrote off our investment in SAP software. We are aggressively pursuing damages for fraud against SAP not only for the cash we spent on the software and SAP's failed implementation but also for the loss benefits promised by SAP. The case is set for a jury trial of State Court in Houston in March 2010.", "Turning to cash flow, first quarter 2009 net cash provided by operating activities was $519 million. Our capital expenditures for the quarter were about $325 million, an increase of $112 million compared with, to the prior year period. Included in this capital is approximately $30 million relating to the purchase of a permanent landfill in our southern group.", "The remaining increase in capital expenditures when comparing with the prior year period can generally be attributed to paying in 2009 capital expenditures incurred in the fourth quarter 2008. So this is a timing difference. Our free cash flow for the quarter was approximately $200 million.", "We are targeting our full year free cash flow to be in the range of $1.3 to $1.4 billion, and we still expect capital expenditures to be $1.1 to $1.2 billion. Our capital spending has some flexibility and can be adjusted if circumstances warrant. We paid $143 million in dividends in the quarter. Our dividend yield is currently 4%. And in the recent fortune 500 rankings, Waste Management was ranked 18 in total shareholder return in 2008.", "In February, we issued $800 million of senior notes, $350 million at at 6 3/8, due March 2015 and $450 million at 7 3/8 due March 2019. The proceeds were used to repay $300 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and we plan to use the balance to repay $500 million of 6 7/8 senior notes that mature in May 2009. We're very pleased to have refinanced this debt under favorable terms in this environment. And we believe this emphasizes the financial strength of our company. And with that Nicole, let's open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line Hamzah Mazari with Credit Suisse.", "Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse", "", "Thank you. Just a couple questions. Could you comment on how scalable is your business and how much room do you have to go before you cannot flex down on the cost side any more, if, for example, volumes take another leg down, and how much of the work that you've already done on the cost side so far is permanent versus temporary? How should we be thinking about that?", "David Steiner", "", "Yeah in terms of flex down, you kind of look at two ways. One, on the collection side, it's really just a matter of rerouting trucks and pulling trucks off the road, and our team has the tools out there. We've developed some routing tools as well as some efficiency tools that all our field operations now have. They're utilizing those tools, and you've seen it in action in the last quarter. You can see the impact of that. On the landfill side, there's not as many people out there that work at our landfills, so it is a little more difficult to actually flex down those costs in accordance with the actual volume decline.", "You can do things like not open the landfill as early in the morning, and perhaps there's some places even that we've looked at not being as open as long or even all day on Saturday. So there are some things that we can do that we have done, and that we can continue to do. So if we do see volumes decline further, there are actions that we can take to further flex down. The second part of your question I've forgotten already.", "Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse", "Yeah the second part is just,", "Bob Simpson", "The statements that we got should all be permanent. That $120 million that we talk about, obviously there's two pieces. There's the flex, and then there's the 120 million. The 120 million we believe should be permanent. We think it makes us a more efficient organization and we think that it right sizes the company, both for today's business level and if we decide to add business in the future as the economy comes back.", "Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse", "How much of your volume declines, you guys saw volume declines a little sooner than some of your competitors did. How much of that was just getting rid of low margin business versus, go ahead.", "David Steiner", "I think it was predominantly that, us getting rid of low-margin business. I think that as you've seen us work through that process, I think you've seen that we've had more normalized volumes when you look at the industry. Now, look long term, our goal is to both increase yield and increase volumes. So that's what we're all about.", "Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse", "Got you. And just last question. On, you provided some detail on your acquisition spend with valuations coming off. We all know why the valuations have come off on the solid waste side, but we still see quite a few bidders on the waste to energy side. Medical waste is still holding up. How much have valuations really come off in those two sub sectors?", "David Steiner", "Yeah that's a great point. The reason why we are adding business in those sectors is because of their recession resistant qualities, and so you are absolutely right, it's a great point that, that valuations have not come down as much in those sectors because they are recession resistant. That's exactly why we're going to add that business.", "Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse", "Okay perfect, thanks a lot, guys.", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Levine with JP Morgan.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan", "Good morning, guys.", "", "David Steiner", "Good morning.", "Bob Simpson", "Good morning.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan", "On the pricing side, looks like you saw acceleration quarter-on-quarter, pricing has been strong for some time now, but I think that's noteworthy given the current economic circumstance. Did that surprise you, and or could you talk about using your new yield methodology sequential trends in your key business lines, any that struck you as surprising to the up side?", "David Steiner", "Yeah, when we saw the economic downturn coming, in the fourth quarter of '08, we recognized that one of the first things that was going to come under pressure was pricing, and that we had to get our costs under control. And so what you saw in the first quarter were two actions that we took that set us up well for the year. We set the pricing gate. We said, look, we're going keep our normal bonus program based on EBITDA and margins, but we're going to put a gate. We're going to put a pricing gate there that says if you can't get through the pricing gate you don't get a bonus at all.", "And so we wanted to maintain the focus on pricing, and I think which you have seen this quarter is the reflection of that. The second thing we did is we said we've got to flex down our costs to right-size the business, because we think this is going to be a year-long economic downturn, and we did just that through the restructuring. So we got proactive towards the end of 2008, and I think that's what you are seeing this quarter. You are seeing the results of that proactive action.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan", "And you raised the savings target by what looks to me about 20 million on the restructuring program. The timing on that is that effective the incremental 20 million called by the middle of the year or is that later in the year?", "David Steiner", "What we saw as you saw in the press release, we saw about $10 million a month of savings in February and March, and so we annualized that as we certainly don't expect to get any of those savings back. When we announced in February we knew it would be in excess of 100 million, so I'm not sure that we particularly changed the target. We always said it would be in excess of 100 million. We just tried to get a little bit more precise as we saw how it played out in February and March.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan", "Understood turning to the acquisition side, in a little bit more detail. Could you differentiate maybe with regard to your profile and waste energy overseas versus what you are pursuing in the US sort of differences with regard to capital deployment and there are any other differences with regard to strategies you'd deploy overseas versus in the US.", "David Steiner", "Yeah when we talk overseas there's two pieces, there's Europe and then there is potentially China. In Europe we would, we're bidding on projects just like we're bidding in the United States. Now some of those projects will require, will be what we call design, build, and operate where, we design it, we build it, we operate it, but we don't actually to have pay the cost to build it. That's paid by the municipality. And there are those that will be DBOO which design, build own and operate where we will put up the cost of capital to build the plant. And so in Europe they probably tend more toward DBOO than in the United States. China is a different situation. In China we would not look to get in to China without a Chinese partner.", "We will not go in de novo waste to energy plants. If we can find the right partner that has great market presence and have the same goals that we have. We would look at making an investment in China, but again that investment would be what we've said is up to $200 million of investments in waste energy, so it would be an investment in a joint venture which would then self fund the building of the projects.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan", "", "Okay. And then turning to medical waste, you made some comments on your last earnings call regarding what your profile is. Any additional narrowing down of the focus and or there are any additional comments with regard to what your interests are there?", "David Steiner", "What we're looking to do in 2009 is to take the first steps toward creating a national footprint in medical waste. We didn't have a large presence in medical waste. We're going to increase that presence this year. We've fully expect by the end of the year we'll be the second largest medical waste player in the industry, and that we'll have taken some nice steps towards creating the national footprint. Look, our solid waste business has a national footprint. The idea of getting into medical waste is not only is it a great business for medical waste but its a great way for us to offer our other services, like solid waste, recycling, LampTracker, all the different things that we do, we can offer sort of a one-stop shop to the hospitals and to the medical communities. So it's a matter of not only getting in for the medical waste but getting in for the other waste streams that come out, medical service providers. And so we need to make sure that our medical waste footprint mirrors our solid waste footprint. And that\u2019s what we are going to be working on in 2009. We think we'll make some great progress towards that end.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan", "All right, thank you.", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with WSI.", "Michael Hoffman - WSI", "Good morning. Couple things on the nonrecurring cash outflows in the first quarter, can you quantify those for us in the first quarter can quantify those for us so we can get a better feel of what that operating rate of free cash flow would have looked like?", "David Steiner", "The nonrecurring cash flow meaning that the two items we mentioned, well, the SAP charge was already incurred, so that's just an accounting adjustment and the $23 million restructuring charge is really related, has really relates to severances that have been paid in the quarter. ", "Michael Hoffman - WSI", "Okay so SAP is not cash but the restructuring is cash.", "David Steiner", "Correct.", "Michael Hoffman - WSI", "So you would, so it's basically take $200 million and add 23 to the it.", "David Steiner", "Correct.", "Michael Hoffman - WSI", "Okay. Then when you when you, somebody asked with regards to valuations of acquisitions, a correct statement is that all valuations across all of these various businesses are down on a relative basis. So its where they have been historically solid waste ones may be down proportionally greater, but when waste energy was trading and the ten times range and greater around the world now, in this sort of seven and eight times. So everything's down. That's a correct statement, I think, right?", "David Steiner", "No doubt about it.", "Michael Hoffman - WSI", "Okay. Which is breeding part of the opportunity to take advantage of that.", "David Steiner", "Absolutely.", "Michael Hoffman - WSI", "Okay. On the medical waste side, there is one very dominant player in the marketplace, had a strategy going for all of the sort of small market players and collect all those all together, and you all as a business model are more in it then towards the bigger volume players, towards the hospitals. That's just sort of a just a legacy issue. One could argue that the other player has shown a lot more interest in going other places in the world because the opportunity to do a lot more, again, growth in the US is, organic or consolidation growth is not as robust as it will be in other places of the world. So help us understand how you grow your business without having to use price to do it.", "David Steiner", "", "Yeah, and that's the beauty of it, Michael it is that we're the only integrated player in the, that covers various waste streams. That player that you are talking about offers medical waste disposal. They don't offer fluorescent bulb disposal. They don't offer recycling services they don't offer solid waste services. And so when we look at the market, and the potential growth in the market we look at all the other waste streams and all the other services that we provide, and we see tremendous growth, because we're not just growing in one segment in that hospital, we're growing across various segments. We think that's an offering that hospitals will look at very favorably, because rather than having to go to a variety of different providers, they can go to the one stop shop, the only company that's going to be able to offer integrated  services throughout the country.", "Michael Hoffman - WSI", "Okay. So again, you're bundling services, and that allows to you bundle twice, so that\u2019s more attractive than adding them up separately is what your saying. ", "David Steiner", "And it gives us more growth. Our market share on the solid waste side in the hospitals is much lower than our overall solid waste market share. So there's a huge opportunity for us to pick that business too ", "Michael Hoffman - WSI", "Ok I\u2019ll repeat it just so to make sure I understand. Your 80% share in garbage, your less share in medical, and you want to match up the medical share against the garbage in those markets.", "David Steiner", "I'm not sure that 80% is a correct number, Michael.", "Michael Hoffman - WSI", "I made a number up. Can you tell me what the average value of the commodities were in 1Q '08? ", "David Steiner", "Average value toward the end of March, it was $77 for the average of all commodities, but what was it during the quarter?", "Larry O'Donnell", "Let's say for the news in cardboard, what we ended up receiving was about high 40s to 50 bucks for news and cardboard was our average.", "Michael Hoffman - WSI", "Okay, that's 1Q '09. What was it in 1Q '08?", "David Steiner", "About 60 to\u2026  I'm sorry, 135 to 140.", "Michael Hoffman - WSI", "It is the average 135 to 140.", "David Steiner", "News and cardboards.", "Michael Hoffman - WSI", "Okay and if you look back over a four or five-year period, I mean, I get that we ended up having this extraordinary growth in the economy and it drives and the Asian marketplace drives the price but if you thought about it as an average over a sustainable basis what you think that average returns to, that you would build a business model around.", "David Steiner", "We've looked at anywhere, $55 to 65 on cardboard.", "Michael Hoffman - WSI", "That low, really. Okay. And then the last question, I just want to make sure there's no confusion, you are absolutely reaffirming your guidance on a free cash flow of 1.3 billion or better, there's no deviation from that?", "David Steiner", "That's correct.", "Michael Hoffman - WSI", "Okay.", "Bob Simpson", "And Michael, the $23 million restructuring charge, 14 million was actually spent in the first quarter and the rest will be spent in the second and third quarter, but there it will be more incurred as we finish up the charge.", "Michael Hoffman - WSI", "Okay. So if I'm looking at it from a free cash flow spend, you're telling me free cash flow would have been sort of 215 to instead of 200.", "", "David Steiner", "Correct.", "Michael Hoffman - WSI", "Okay. Great. Well, nice job folks maintaining price. Keep it up.", "Bob Simpson", "Thank you, Michael.", "Michael Hoffman - WSI", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Feinberg with Goldman Sachs.", "David Feinberg - Goldman Sachs", "Good morning.", "Bob Simpson", "Hello, David.", "David Steiner", "Good morning David.", "David Feinberg - Goldman Sachs", "Few questions can you talk first about volume trends by month and maybe how April started off here, both in across all lines of business, give us a sense of how the quarter shaped up?", "David Steiner", "I think like a lot of American businesses we sort of saw a January starting out weak, volumes sort of bottomed and the February timeframe and then we started to see the up tick from there. It's hard to tell. You all know that for us, because of the seasonality, and because of weather in the first quarter, it's always a little to tell what's going on between the seasonality and actual volumes. Throw into that the uncertainty around the economy, and that's why we say we think it\u2019s just a little bit too early to call the year on volumes. But what we saw was that the volumes sort of bottomed in February, they stabilized after that. And we started to see some seasonal up tick. We just don\u2019t now quite yet we had some weather events in April, particularly through the Midwest. So we're not ready to say that what the magnitude of the seasonal uptick is going to be this year.", "David Feinberg - Goldman Sachs", "Although, weather events, though, wouldn't they hurt you in the near term but might help you in the long term in terms of cleanup effects, or were they not big enough to move the needle?", "David Steiner", "Well, generally, the yes, some of the floods maybe in the Midwest, that long term might help, but I was talking more about the snowstorms that we had that moved through the Midwest in April. So some unusual timing for snow storms, and that type of volume generally doesn't come back.", "David Feinberg - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, all right, and then a few follow-up questions on restructuring. You talked about the cash component here in the first quarter, and I just want to make sure I understood. The $15 million of additional restructuring charges, is that $15 million in 2Q and $15 million in 3Q, or it's $15 million spread over the two?", "Larry O'Donnell", "No, that's total in those two quarters.", "David Feinberg - Goldman Sachs", "And the total it will be $15 million cash, it might be spread over a longer period of time is that safe to say?", "David Steiner", "Yes probably right because the severances are generally paid is, over the term of their severance plan. So severance payment will be longer than just one quarter.", "Bob Simpson", "Yeah some of that is lease termination, so there might be a little bit less net cash if we could sub lease the property. But otherwise there would be cash outlet here in lease.", "David Feinberg - Goldman Sachs", "Got you. You had mentioned nine out of ten cost items were down year-over-year, which the one that was up probably if you mentioned it, I missed it.", "Bob Simpson", "It was other. And it's really relates to some gains on sale last year. So it's, I didn't talk about it because it's so small.", "David Feinberg - Goldman Sachs", "Fair enough. And then following up on first question from today's call, maybe just to get to the point, can you tell us what your fixed versus variable cost structure is on either on the collection or landfill side? I've looked at it on a blended basis and said its more probably like a 50/50 mix. First of all is that a good starting point, and then how would you differentiate between the two sides?", "Bob Simpson", "50/50 is a good place to start. On the collection side it's somewhat more variable than that on the landfill said it's probably a lot less fixed, its all a matter of, a lot more fixed, excuse me, much higher rate, and it\u2019s more a matter of, I mean, everything is variable at some level, but I would say it's closer to 65/35 on the landfill side fixed variable that will be a good starting point to do the work.", "David Feinberg - Goldman Sachs", "Great, and then one last question. You talked about CapEx being flexible. We have new deal regulations coming effect here in 2010. I was trying to get a sense, I think you had talked in the past about not doing pre buy. But what is the absolute minimum amount you have to spend each year to adhere to the new maintenance plans and some of the other operational savings that you put in place? I'm trying to get a sense of what is maintenance versus, I don't know if growth is the right word, but what's optional?", "Larry O'Donnell", "Well, certainly, we'd like to keep decent average fleet age, but if we absolutely had to, we could go a year and not buy trucks. I wouldn't want to do that. But if we had to, in fact, we faced that a little bit with the 2007 engine. We had a lot of problems with that engine when they first came out, and we curtailed our buy significantly as a result of that. So that's we do have the flexibility to do that now, we are working with the manufacturers right now on 2010 technology. It appears to me that the manufacturers are in a little better position at this point in time compared to where we were in 2007. So hopefully, knock on wood, we won't experience the kind of problems we had in 2007 when we start bringing on the 2010 technology.", "David Steiner", "Generally, what we've said, David is that of our CapEx is about 40% is dedicated to our landfill. We are going to spend that now obviously if volumes come down you don't have to spend as much but there's not a lot of variation there. About 40% of our capital is allocated to trucks and containers. Obviously we can flex that we've already flexed on the container side, we can certainly flex in other areas and about 20% of our CapEx relates to other types of projects, things like landfill gas to energy, and other things like that but its totally discretionary, great investments but as totally discretionary. So when you look at the CapEx budget, there's one component that there is not much movement in. There's another one that's more and a third that's almost purely discretionary.", "David Feinberg - Goldman Sachs", "Great, that's very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill fisher with Raymond James.", "Jim Alderson", "", "Good morning Bill.", "Bill fisher - Raymond James", "Add just on the pricing incentives, you obviously stressed that that\u2019s big much great weight on the bonuses this year. Are there any specific things, like pushing the environmental surcharge more some other things that you could touch that may have an incremental impact, as well?", "David Steiner", "Yeah, it\u2019s a great point, Bill, when we put the pricing gate out there, we didn't want to just put the pricing gate out and say here's a pricing gate good luck meeting it. We put the pricing gate out and then we also put out a lot of different tools on how folks can meet the pricing gate, the environmental fee being a great example, where we raise the environment fee to 6%. But, there is a lot of other things that drive the overall pricing, too, things like our retention, things like new business pricing. So we sent out the toolbox out to the field to say, here's the tools that you can use to meet those pricing target. It's a great point. We don't want to set a pricing target without showing folks ways they can get there, the environmental fee obviously being a great example that.", "Bill fisher - Raymond James", "Okay. Did that go up from 4%? Or", "David Steiner", "It went up from 4.2 to 6.", "Bill fisher - Raymond James", "Okay. I guess, on recycling, I think, Larry, you mentioned the March pricing, I think was 77. Is that kind of an all-in thing including plastic and aluminum and everything?", "Larry O'Donnell", "Yeah, that would be fully blended with everything, aluminum, plastic everything.", "Bill fisher - Raymond James", "Was that up a decent amount from January, February?", "Larry O'Donnell", "Yes, what we saw is sequentially, January, February went up a little bit, then March went up a little bit. So it has been an upward trend.", "David Steiner", "Bill, when we gave guidance at the beginning of the year, obviously there was some expectation on what pricing was going to do, if we were going to hit that $0.15 to $0.20 negative impact from recycling. It's encouraging to note that if prices just stay where they are today, now that we've had three months to look at it, pricing has come up, and if pricing stays as bad as it is today, which we don't expect, we expect it to get better during the year, but if it stays where it is today we've got about $0.20 effect on earnings. So we think that we've seen the worst and that our $0.20 is a worst-case scenario.", "Bill fisher - Raymond James", "Okay, great. And then just on that, you mentioned you're also looking at changing the contract terms as they roll over, and getting more upfront fees or processing fees. Is there any estimate you have of what percentage of contracts you can cycle through over the next year or two years, or get that in place?", "Larry O'Donnell, III,", "Yeah. Some of those contracts, particularly the ones with municipalities, sometimes they're tied to a little longer term contract. So the ones that we have that are not municipalities, those we can get through in the next two to three years. Some of the municipal contracts they might be a little longer term. It could take us a little longer. But for the most part, other than a small group of contracts that were still sort of tied into floor or fixed prices, I think in the first quarter those ended up costing us about $5 million in EBIT, so we've already started work our way through those, and we'll continue to do so.", "David Steiner", "You know, Bill the concept here is, as commodity prices go down obviously you lose money in recycling. We can weather that storm. We a big enought company that we can weather that storm. But the fear is that you are going to start to lose recycling infrastructure throughout the country when folks that can't weather that storm start going out of business.", "And our communities, we think our dedicated to recycling they don't want to see that happen. And so this is not just for us to maintain our viability frankly this is something that I think the industry have to look at to maintain the viability of the infrastructure. Because you are seeing a lot of communities that are stopping recycling, you are seeing a lot of businesses that are in distress, and certainly some businesses that are going out of business because of the low commodity prices. I think that the community that are dedicated to recycling need that take a relook at it so that long-term they can make sure they have the infrastructure to continue to recycle materials.", "Bill fisher - Raymond James", "Okay. And just to follow up on that, on some of the contracts you're able to go into existing contracts and maybe change the terms, in others you have to kind of wait until the contract itself expires?", "David Steiner", "That's correct.", "Bill fisher - Raymond James", "Okay, perfect. All right, thank you very much.", "David Steiner", "Thank you, Bill.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Corey Greendale with First Analysis.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "Thanks.", "David Steiner", "Good morning, Cor.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "Good morning. Just continuing the recycling contract conversation Larry, I think you said that those discussions have already started, how are the discussions going and how willing are customers to give back more given that I imagine they are herding right now.", "Larry O'Donnell", "Well, its like David said, some of them certainly understand that companies can't just continue to lose money, and if they want to have recycling program, we\u2019ve got to work to try to come up with the way that works everyone. So some have been receptive, I am not going to tell you all of them. Some of them know that we've got a contract and we\u2019ve got to honor that contract. So the key is the approach that we're going forward with new contracts, and we're not going to offer floor pricing. We're going to make sure that the way we set up our contracts we get paid for our processing, plus something to cover our cost of capital, decent return on that, and then we'll share the up side, part of the up side with our customers as commodity prices allow to us do that. And people with the new approach, people seem fine with that approach. That makes sense to them.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "Okay. And David, on the solid waste pricing, you reiterated that go goal is 50, 100 basis points above core CPI. If we're in a negative CPI environment, do you think that pricing could be zero or negative and that would be okay in negative CPI or is there some floor you would set on that regardless?", "David Steiner", "Yeah, what we've said in the past, if it goes negative, we have no doubt that we will not go negative with it. That we sort of view 2% as a floor that we wouldn't want to see us go below.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "Okay. I think, you commented earlier that you last year identified pricing as potentially at risk given the economic environment, what and looking at public companies, we're not seeing a lot of diminution and price growth, what do you think from smaller competitors? And are you seeing any changes in behavior now versus six months ago?", "David Steiner", "Yeah, I really don\u2019t think, we are seeing much difference than we did six months ago, whether you talk about the locals or the nationals or the regionals, you usually have different pockets of pricing activity, and I don't think that's changed.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "And on the landfill side, are you seeing any regional difference? We just heard like in the northeast, for example that pricing was weaker than in some other areas in the country.", "David Steiner", "Yes, I think that's probably consistent with what we're seeing, that the Northeast, because of the amount of capacity they have up there is probably under the most pressure.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "Okay. And then just one clarification on the guidance. The 1.1 million to 1.2 million CapEx does that include the amounts that were incurred in Q1 relative to '08 expenditures?", "Bob Simpson", "You have to expect it, that's a normal. We generally have an accrual at the end of the year that carries over to the first quarter and we'll expect to have an accrual at the end of the, this year that will carry over to first quarter next year. So it should anticipate that.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "And the fact that you are not giving EPS guidance, does that suggest that you still feel like you don't have the kind of visibility into the year that would you ordinarily have, or is visibility improving and you just feel philosophically that there's not a lot of motivation to give EPS guidance?", "David Steiner", "As we've said in the past, until we sort of see the magnitude of the seasonal uptick it's sort of hard to predict the entire year. And in April, particularly when we've had the weather events we've had, it's always difficult after just the first few weeks of April to call the seasonal uptick, the magnitude of the seasonal uptick. And so, then when you layer onto that the uncertainty around the economy, you are absolutely right, we thought it was prudent to wait and see how the volumes shape up in the second quarter.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ellis with Merrill Lynch.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, and good morning, guys.", "David Steiner", "Good morning.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Apologize for the noise in the background here. Just first off, you talked a little bit about pricing, and I appreciate the detail you gave on your calculation of pricing in the press release. But just to be clear, the volume figures that you quote, is that just off of the revenue base in collection disposal, or is that off the total revenue base for the Company?", "David Steiner", "The volume is off the total revenue base of the company.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. So obviously the volume declines would have looked a little bit more severe if just using the revenue base and collection disposal as you talked about for the pricing side.", "David Steiner", "Well, we looked at it a little bit differently. When we talked about that $456 million decrease in revenue, over 70% of that came from things outside of solid waste, and so when you looked at the overall revenue decline, only about 4.7% of the revenue decline actually related to solid waste.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. And just on the, you gave some detail on commercial and residential volumes not showing much of a deterioration from last quarter, so down around 4% I think you said, but noted that landfill volumes are down low double digits. I guess just in thinking about it, because I know that volumes in residential and commercial markets are measured not based off of weight but are based off container size and frequency of pickup. But what gives you confidence that over time you may not see the volume declines, particularly in the commercial market, perhaps start to trend more towards the kind of volume declines you are seeing on the landfill side of the business right now?", "David Steiner", "Yeah, it was, the commercial line of business is going to be driven mostly by companies, if they go out of business. Right, on the landfill side, it can be driven by general economic activity. So if there's less commercial construction, if there's less residential construction, you are going to see lower volumes into the landfill. But generally, if there's a lower amount of commercial activity, they still to have to have a container. And so that's why we call that recession resistant, because unless and until that business actually goes out of business, you are not going to see the volume decline. Certainly we've seen an uptick in companies that are going out of business, but it still maintained that volume at around negative 4%. I don't think you are going to see a huge shutdown of businesses if the economy continues to weaken.", "So you just have a different dynamic working in the commercial market where with the landfill side, it is binary. They're either doing the project or they're not, and sometimes they can opt to not do the project. It's not binary at the commercial level. If your doors are open, you need a bin. That's why we think it's more recession resistant.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. That's helpful, appreciate that. On the bonus targets you've talked about earlier and the price gates in place, and I realize it's a market by market dynamic. But anything you can quantity in terms of in aggregate, what kind of price targets you've put in place?", "David Steiner", "Yes, as I mentioned, we did it based on revenue per unit, which is not the way we measure yield, but we thought that revenue per unit is an easier method for folks, how they can actually control it at their market areas. But it was designed in order to ensure that we maintain that pricing at 50 to 100 basis points above core CPI. So it should work out that way. Certainly we saw it work out better than that in the first quarter.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then just you spoke a little bit earlier about this bundling strategy potentially with medical waste and solid waste and recycling services. And just thinking back, if we look at history, one of the challenges that the company faced in the past is offering bundled services, but actually still achieving appropriate pricing on each of those services, an adequate return on capital. And so, I guess, what I would ask is how do you think about pursuing a bundling strategy but not getting lulled into a scenario where you make compromise on price in order to make inroads with customers from a bundled basis?", "David Steiner", "Yeah, that is a great point. There is two pieces that go into the price, and that obviously is the price that you charge and your cost of service, right. I think we've demonstrated over the last five years that we are not going to take on business that is dilutive to our margin. And so there is really two sides to it. There is what price do you charge for the bundled service, then how can you drive efficiencies into the system so that you can drive your cost of service down and make a higher margin on that business. And so there's only one thing I can promise you, and that is that we will not lead with price. We're going to make sure that we get the returns on this business that are accretive to our overall margin.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. Appreciate that. And then just my final question, given holding the line on the free cash flow guidance for the year, and the debt refinancing has been completed and you have already laid out what you plan to spend on acquisitions over the next few years, the residual free cash thats available, any thoughts there on reinitiating a share buyback program?", "David Steiner", "Yeah, I think, Jonathan, as we said at the beginning of the year, we got ourselves into a very good position at the end of 2008 from a cash point of view. Issuing the notes got us into an even stronger cash position. But until we are willing to say that the economy has turned around, we want to maintain that cash position. And so I don't think that we'll be in the market short term, long term we have told our shareholders that we're going allocate the capital either to dividends or to paying down debt or doing acquisitions or doing share repurchases. We obviously see a little bit more opportunity on the acquisition side. And so after acquisitions and after we get the balance sheet in shape, I think the next area that we would look would be looking at share repurchase. But in the meantime, I think maintaining a solid balance sheet, maintaining that cash so that we can do acquisitions out of free cash rather than borrowing, I think is the prudent approach.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Great, thanks, guys.", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Your final question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.", "Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank", "Hi.", "David Steiner", "Good morning.", "Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. So just a couple. Most of mine have been answered. But first of all, on the restructuring, can you give some color into how that would phase between the two quarters? Would it be an equal split or more heavily weighted towards the second quarter?", "Bob Simpson", "The benefits, Nicole?", "Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank", "No, the costs.", "Bob Simpson", "The costs are more heavily into the first quarter from an earnings side. From a cash side, it will be spread out over the rest of the year.", "Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Great, and then obviously you guys had some really great pricing performance this quarter. Given that your customers are clearly looking for ways to cut their costs, too, have you seen an uptick in customer attrition quarter-over-quarter?", "David Steiner", "Not really. The attrition rate, the defection rate this quarter was 10.6%, which is basically flat with last year.", "Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, that's all I had. Thanks, guys.", "David Steiner", "As we looked at the beginning of the year, we asked our folks in the company to focus on two things, because we knew the economy was going to be soft. We asked them to focus on pricing, and we asked them to focus on cost controls. I think this quarter demonstrates that they're firing on all cylinders in those regards, and frankly, it shows why we believe we have the best people in this industry. And with that thank you all for having us, and we'll see you next quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you for participating in today's Waste Management first quarter 2009 earnings release.

With me this morning are David Steiner, Chief Executive Officer, Larry O\u2019Donnell, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Bob Simpson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "David will start things off with a summary of the financial results for the quarter and a review of the details of our revenue growth including price and volume trends. Larry will discuss operating costs and Bob will cover the financial statement. We will conclude with questions and answers.", "Before we get started, let me remind you that in addition to our press release that was issued this morning, we have filed a Form 8-K that includes the press release as an attachment and is available at our website at www.wm.com.

Certain factors related to future expectations are detailed in our press release this morning and in our filings with the Securities & Exchange Commission including the Form 10-K filed for 2008. ", "This call is being recorded and will be available 24 hours a day beginning approximately 1 pm Eastern time today until 5 pm Eastern time on August 13.

", "Now, I will turn the call over to Waste Management CEO David Steiner.", "David E. Steiner", "Thanks, Jim and good morning from Houston.", "When we look at the quarter, we see that our core solid waste operations continue to benefit from our pricing and cost program. Our overall results were affected by a number of things that have little to do with our core solid waste business. We had a reduction of $0.07 from our recycling operations. Lower energy prices for the energy sold by certain of our Wheelabrator plants had a negative $0.03 effect in the quarter and foreign currency translations and waste energy development costs had $0.01 of negative earnings impact. Without these items, we would have matched prior year earnings despite the volume losses. This shows the strength of our core operating model which focuses on pricing and operational excellence. We would expect the second half of the year to follow a similar pattern. Our pricing and cost programs will largely make up for volume losses but we will still face headwinds from lower commodity prices in our recycling operations in the third quarter and lower energy prices in our Wheelabrator operations will likely continue for the remainder of the year.", "We also to expect to incur about $10 million of costs associated with the growth of our waste energy business in the second half of the year but we certainly believe our investment will pay off. I\u2019ll discuss our international waste energy development later in my remarks.", "I\u2019m please that we\u2019ve achieved solid second quarter results given this challenging economic environment. We maintained our focus on pricing and achieved internal revenue growth from yields on our collection and disposal business of 3%. We realized the full benefit of our reorganization announced in February and saved over $30 million of costs during the quarter. We increased productivity in each of our collection lines of business. We\u2019ve even seen some positive signs from the macroeconomic front with recycling commodity prices which have increased each month since the lows reached in January and solid waste volumes appear to be stabilizing which should lead to year-over-year better comparisons beginning in the fourth quarter of this year.", "Looking at revenue in the second quarter, revenue declined by $537 million compared to the prior year period but most of the decline was a result of items that did not relate to our solid waste collection and disposal operations, $207 million of the decline was due to recycling revenues and energy prices, $116 million was related to the decline in fuel surcharge revenue as oil prices declined, and $28 million was related to foreign currency translation. This leads to the second quarter 2009 revenue decline related to our solid waste collection and disposal business of $186 million or about 5.3% of revenue.", "Pricing continued to be strong and consistent. Internal revenue growth from collection and disposal yield in the second quarter was 3%. Internal revenue growth from yield was strongest in the three collection lines of business. Combined, the revenue growth from yield in the industrial, commercial and residential lines of our collection business was 4.1% in the second quarter. We again produced our strongest results in our commercial collection line of business where internal revenue growth from yield was 4.6% in the quarter. The yield components of internal revenue growth in our industrial and residential lines of business were 4% and 3.7%, respectively. ", "Internal revenue growth from volumes declined 8.6% in the quarter compared to the prior year quarter. The recession-resistant lines of our business, mainly commercial and residential collection, saw volume declines of 5.1% and 3.6%, respectively, similar to what we\u2019ve seen in recent quarters but in our more economically sensitive roll-off line of business, we did see further declines as roll-off volumes were off 19%. Despite lower volumes, we maintained our focus on roll-off pricing which resulted in revenue growth from yield of 4% for the quarter. We continue to work to obtain price increases in our roll-off line despite lower volumes and certainly we will continue that strategy. Overall, we expanded our income from operations margin in the collection line of business by 140 basis points. ", "Turning to yield and volume on the disposal side of business, second quarter 2009 internal growth from volume decreased by 16.9% compared to the same period in 2008. The second quarter of the time of year, we usually see a seasonal increase in volume and we did see a seasonal increase with tonnage of 10.3% compared to the first quarter of 2009 but this increase was only about half the rate that we\u2019ve seen in prior years. The softness occurred primarily in our more economically sensitive special waste and C&D line. Compared to the second quarter of 2008, internal revenue growth from volume of special waste was -23.6% and for C&D, it was -15.9%. Internal revenue growth from volume for MSW was -5.8% compared to the second quarter of 2008. So sequentially, MSW showed some improvement from the first quarter of 2009 when internal revenue growth from volume was -8.1%.", "On the pricing front for the quarter, our internal revenue growth from yield was strongest in our MSW line with per unit pricing up by 4.3%. Again, we\u2019ll maintain our focus on MSW pricing despite the lower volume.", "The recycling markets have shown significant improvement since January of this year with commodity prices rising on average over 41% between January and June. Commodity prices have continued to improve into July. Even with this improvement however, average commodity prices were down approximately 50% in the second quarter of 2009 compared to the prior year period. This decline in commodity prices caused a negative year-over-year impact on earnings of $0.07 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2009 consistent with our expectations. ", "We continue to work on revising our pricing and rebate model in our recycling operations to moderate the future effect of commodity pricing on our operations. Our new approach is designed to ensure we cover our processing costs plus earn a fair return on our capital. We\u2019ve already changed a number of our contracts and our efforts have been well received but it will take some time to work our way through the customer base. Changing the price structure will help to ensure the long-term viability of our recycling operations by making them less exposed to cyclical commodity prices.", "On the cost side, the company-wide reorganization we announced in February continues to produce the savings we anticipated and we continue to forecast annualized savings in excess of $120 million. ", "As we look at the balance of the year, we anticipate that year-over-year volumes in our residential and commercial lines will continue to show their recession-resistant qualities and decline at a level of about 3.5%-5.5%. In our more economically sensitive roll-off and landfill lines, while the rate of decline appears to be slowing, we\u2019re building our plans assuming that year-over-year declines in volume for the second half of the year will be similar to our second quarter 2009 volume results. In other words, we expect that volumes will show only about half of the seasonal uptick that we normally see in the third quarter. This would mean that third quarter year-over-year volume comparisons could be slightly more negative than what we saw for the second quarter but fourth quarter volume comparisons should start to improve.", "Given our assumptions, we expect that our full year earnings per diluted share will fall within the range of $1.95-$1.99 a share on an added diluted basis. ", "Looking to the future, we\u2019re excited by the expansion of our waste-to-energy business. We recently were selected as the winning bidder to purchase a 40% interest in Shanghai Environment Group, the leading waste energy company in China. We\u2019re now negotiating the terms of our joint venture and expect to conclude our agreements in the near future and we continue to pursue opportunities in waste-to-energy in Europe and the United States.", "In our first quarter conference call, we mentioned that we were likely to spend up to $200 million in med waste acquisitions. At that time, we had a confidential letter of intent to acquire a med waste company for nearly $175 million and we expected to enter into a definitive agreement within a week after our conference call. As many of you know, a competitor offered more for the business and we maintained our acquisition discipline by not further increasing our offer. Consequently, our med waste business will continue to grow but at a slower pace than we anticipated.", "We\u2019ve also decided to re-enter the market to purchase our shares. Our capital allocation over the past five years has been very clear, return cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while opportunistically acquiring assets. In the past year, we haven\u2019t repurchased any shares but with our strong balance sheet and cash generating abilities and our confidence in our cashflow performance for the remainder of the year, we\u2019ve decided to resume repurchasing shares with authority to spend up to $400 million during the remainder of 2009.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Larry.", "Lawrence O\u2019Donnell III", "Thank you David and good morning. I will begin by reviewing our operating cost results for the second quarter of 2009. ", "Operating expenses in the second quarter of 2009 were $1.77 billion or 60.2% of revenue, an improvement of $404 million from the second quarter of 2008 or 230 basis points as a percent of revenue. This is a strong performance given the decline in revenue. ", "The cost reduction is due primarily to four factors. First, flexing down costs and executing our restructuring plan, second, lower recycling commodity prices which results in lower rebates we pay to our customers, third, lower fuel costs from the decline in diesel fuel prices and fourth, the decline in the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar.", "I\u2019m pleased with the disciplined approach exhibited by our team in managing our controllable operating costs during tough economic conditions. I\u2019m also pleased with the way our team is performing in the new organization we announced at the beginning of the year. The new structure has enabled us to quickly react to the lower volumes by flexing down our costs while at the same time continuing our operational improvements in the areas of safety, productivity, fleet maintenance, and service to our customers. The new structure also puts us in a great position to leverage our cost structure when the economy begins to recover.", "I will now review our performance from the second quarter of 2009 compared to the prior year period in a number of the cost categories. Labor and employee benefits costs improved by $45 million in the quarter. This improvement is the result primarily of reducing routes and improving asset efficiency in reaction to the volume declines, achieving productivity improvements in all three of our collection lines of business as well as labor costs savings that resulted from our restructuring announced in February of this year.", "We reduced our driver hours by about 991,000 hours. Over 70% of this reduction was due to reducing our capacity by taking trucks off the road as volumes declined and the remainder was primarily due to continued productivity improvement. ", "Our total recordable injury rate improved to 2.8 in the second quarter, a 15.9% improvement compared to the prior year approaching world-class performance. We\u2019re very pleased with this achievement which demonstrates our continued leadership and safety as well as our commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees and our communities.", "Transfer and disposal expenses which include those costs that our collection companies pay to third-party landfills and transfer stations improved by $36 million primarily due to volume declines and our continued focus on reducing our third-party disposal costs by improving internalization. ", "We lowered our maintenance and repair costs in total by $18 million in the second quarter of 2009 compared with the prior year period. Collection and heavy equipment fleet maintenance accounted for the bulk of this savings improving by $15 million. Since the beginning of the year, we have taken over 300 pieces of heavy equipment out of service and adjusted our operating hours given the lower volumes coming into our landfills. Standardizing our fleet and implementing our cost-effective preventative maintenance program has enabled us to continue to reduce our fleet maintenance costs.", "Subcontractor costs improved by $59 million or almost 80 basis points due to using fewer third-party contractors as a result of lower volumes and a decrease in indirect fuel costs passed on to us by our subcontract haulers. Cost of goods sold decreased by $110 million or over 260 basis points as a percent of revenue, principally due to the reduction of recycling commodity rebates.  We\u2019ve seen recycling commodity prices improve steadily since January of this year. We expect recycling commodity prices to continue to improve moderately for the remainder of the year and we expect to see more modest negative year-over-year impact from our recycling operations in the second half of 2009.", "For the second half of 2009, the projected impact to earnings per diluted share from our recycling operations compared to the prior year should be in the range of -$0.03-$0.05 impact in the third quarter and could be slightly positive in the fourth quarter. ", "We lowered our direct fuel costs by approximately $114 million compared to the second quarter of 2008, as a result of lower diesel fuel prices and using less fuel as volumes decline. Indirect fuel costs charged to us by our subcontract transfer station haulers declined by approximately $23 million. As I mentioned in the past, our fuel surcharge program continues to keep pace with changes in our direct and indirect diesel fuel costs over time. ", "Landfill operating costs improved by $23 million in the second quarter of 2009 compared with the prior year period as a result of two factors. First, we benefitted from the accounting impact of higher interest rates which are used to estimate the present value of our environmental mediation obligations. Second, we have flexed down our landfill costs as a result of operational improvements and lower volumes.", "I also want to give you an update on the restructuring on our operations that we announced in February which has proceeded very smoothly. We incurred charges during the second quarter of approximately $5 million for this restructuring. We realized total cost savings of over $30 million for the second quarter related to the restructuring or about $10 million per month. Consequently, we continue to expect realized savings from our restructuring to exceed $120 million. ", "I\u2019d like to congratulate our entire team on the outstanding work they did during the quarter in flexing down our costs with the volume decline.  I\u2019m pleased to see how well our restructuring has been implemented enabling our team to work collaboratively to continue to improve our company and our service to our customers in spite of the challenge from the current economic environment.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bob.", "Robert G. Simpson", "Thank you, Larry.  ", "I\u2019d like to start out by discussing FG&A costs. These costs decreased by $35 million to $323 million during the second quarter of 2009 versus the same quarter of 2008. This decrease is due primarily to labor cost savings that resulted in our restructuring announced in February of this year, lower long-term incentive plan expenses and reductions in travel and entertainment partially offset by higher bad debt expense and higher professional fees related to our business development initiatives in China and Europe. David and Larry both spoke about the restructuring and I would like to point out that approximately 70% of the restructuring cost savings in the second quarter were realized in the SG&A category. We believe this new level of SG&A will be able to support our business going forward even when the economy turns around and volumes go up. ", "Bad debt expense increased by almost $3 million for the quarter due primarily to the effects of the weak economy. We continue managing all of our receivables very closely and even in this environment our days sales outstanding improved slightly compared to the prior year period. ", "Depreciation and amortization expense for the second quarter 2009 declined $16 million when compared with the second quarter 2008 principally as a result of lower landfill volumes. As a percentage of revenue, depreciation and amortization expense was 10.2% compared with 9.1% in the prior year quarter with the increase primarily due to the decline in revenue. Our debt to total capital ratio was 56.4% and the floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 28% at the end of the quarter.", "Moving to income taxes, in the second quarter 2009, our collective tax rate was approximately 37.9%. We expect our effective tax rate for the full year to be 37.6%.", "Turning to cash flow, second quarter 2009 net cash provided by operating activities was $584 million. Our capital expenditures for the quarter were about $258 million, a decrease of $15 million compared to the prior year period. ", "Our free cash flow for the quarter was approximately $297 million. We are targeting our full year free cash flow to be approximately $1.3 billion with capital expenditures now expected to be between $1 billion-$1.1 billion. We paid $142 million in dividends in the quarter and our dividend yield is currently 3.9%.", "We repaid the $500 million of 6 7/8 senior notes matured in May 2009 with proceeds of the $800 million of senior notes that we issued in February. The balance of the proceeds were used to repay $300 million of outstanding borrowing under the revolving credit facility. ", "We announced today that we will be resuming our share buyback program and are authorized to purchase up to $400 million in shares through the end of 2009. We believe that this is the right time to resume our share repurchases for several reasons. First the financial markets have shown substantial improvement and we demonstrated our ability to access reasonably priced debt in our February note offering. Second, our balance sheet is strong with our debt to total capital ratio at 56.4%. Third, even in a weak economic environment, we\u2019ve maintained strong free cash flow and fourth, it appears volumes are stabilizing.", "Finally, the success we have had in managing in this difficult environment is due to our employees, the best in the business. We thank them for their dedication and with that, Nicole, let\u2019s open the line for questions.", "", "James G. Alderson", "Hey, Nicole. I\u2019m sorry, this is Jim Alderson. Let me interrupt just one second. I understand that the webcast was not working properly at the beginning of our call. I do want to apologize for that and I just want to let you know that we are up and running right now and we will get the replay up as soon as possible. So again I apologize and Nicole, let\u2019s turn it over to questions.", "", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from the line of Scott Levine with J.P. Morgan. ", "Scott Levine - J.P. Morgan", "With regard to the volume outlook which sounds like in general, it\u2019s stabilizing and the back half expected to be roughly consistent with what you\u2019ve just seen, are there any observations you can offer up on a geographic basis? Were there material differences in certain parts of the country, either better or worse?", "", "David E. Steiner", "Yes, you hit the nail on the head, Scott. We\u2019ve seen basically through June and continuing into July, it\u2019s flat volumes which as I said was about half of what we normally see in the seasonal uptick. You know, it\u2019s pretty widespread throughout the country. There\u2019s not dramatic differences. Obviously, year-over-year comps in some places like the Midwest are better because they weren\u2019t as robust last year as this year but generally I would say that the volume weakness is fairly evenly spread throughout the country.", "", "Scott Levine - J.P. Morgan", "Turning to the trending on the waste-to-energy business, can you remind us of the percentage of your contracts where pricing is locked in and maybe steps that you can take to mitigate the impact of price volatility on the business there?", "", "David E. Steiner", "Sure. In the past year, we\u2019ve gone from having 2% of our contracts float to having 28% of our contracts float. Obviously, we want to have a portfolio that\u2019s balanced with some float and some fixed. That\u2019s going to hurt you in days like today when you see energy prices going down. It\u2019s going to help you when you see energy prices going up. So as we look forward, Scott, we will always look for opportunities to lock in energy prices at good rates. Certainly now is not the time to lock in those rates.", "", "Scott Levine - J.P. Morgan", "And customer recidivity levels you expect will be accommodating, what\u2019s your expectation there? ", "", "David E. Steiner", "You mean as far as waste-to-energy and selling the energy?", "", "Scott Levine - J.P. Morgan", "Yes.", "", "David E. Steiner", "No, we haven\u2019t had any issues at all as far as selling the energy. Obviously, we\u2019re selling it at spot price but we haven\u2019t had any issues at all as far as the actual sales of the energy goes.", "", "Scott Levine - J.P. Morgan", "One last one on the CapEx budgets, it looks like that\u2019s coming down by $100 million or so, is that right?", "", "Robert G. Simpson", "A little bit more than that, about $120 million.", "", "Scott Levine - J.P. Morgan", "And what areas are you likely to trim there?", "", "David E. Steiner", "It\u2019s pretty much spread amongst machinery and equipment and real estate, not too much coming out of landfill or fleet.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Credit Suisse.", "Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse", "", "Could you comment a little more on restarting your buybacks? Is that driven by volume stabilization you\u2019re seeing or is that just a lack of large deals you want to pursue in waste-to-energy and medical? In any case there\u2019s nothing big out there. I\u2019m trying to get a sense of, you could have restarted this buyback last quarter so just trying to get a sense of what\u2019s driving that. Is it volumes? Is it acquisitions not being there?", "David E. Steiner", "Yeah, again, I think you\u2019ve analyzed it very well. As we mentioned, at the end of last quarter, we had a letter of intent to send $175 million of med waste business. That no longer exists and I think you hit the nail on the head. It\u2019s a number of factors, frankly. It\u2019s the stabilization in the volumes in the beginning of the year. You had the credit markets that were still not really stabilized. We accessed those in February so we took care of our current maturities. We don\u2019t have another maturity due until August of 2010 and that\u2019s only $600 million. So clearly we can fund that out of free cash flow. Looking forward, we have a lot more confidence in the stability of our free cash flow and our ability to manage that free cash flow and our ability to understand what\u2019s going on in the economy. We thought now was the time to start back. I think you\u2019re right, it is, it\u2019s not one factor. It\u2019s a number of factors and certainly the fact that we don\u2019t have that med waste acquisition of $200 million weighs into the timing of when we do it.", "", "Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse", "Just two quick questions. How much of your portfolio, how much of your contracts overall are linked to inflation? Is it 40%? Is it less? And then, can you give us a little more color on the seasonal uptick? You\u2019re talking about, you\u2019re saying you\u2019re still seeing some but it\u2019s half the historical levels. Why are you so sure of that and what\u2019s driving that?", "", "David E. Steiner", "I\u2019ll let Jim Alderson make a comment on the, we\u2019re talking about residential contracts and Jim\u2019s probably got the best insight into that.", "James G. Alderson", "I mean on an overall basis, you got about plus or minus about 25% of our total revenue is tied in with public sector, what we would call the public sector and basically the majority of those would have some type of CPI adjustments.", "", "David E. Steiner", "On the volume question, what we\u2019ve seen basically since we saw the first signs of the seasonal uptick early in the second quarter, what we\u2019ve basically seen are volumes that have been remarkably stable throughout the quarter. There really hasn\u2019t been wide variation. So we\u2019ve got, gosh, we\u2019ve probably got 10-12 weeks of data that shows us that volumes have been very stable within a very narrow band and that\u2019s what gives us the confidence, that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to proceed going forward. Obviously none of us can predict the economy but that\u2019s certainly looking at the path or the predictor of the future, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Wunderlich Securities.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "To follow up on the medical waste comment, am I correct in interpreting, it\u2019s not a lack of desire to be in it, it\u2019s just that you\u2019re going to do it more organically so that\u2019s the slower pace?", "", "David E. Steiner", "That\u2019s exactly right.", "", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "Okay. To also follow up on the buyback, I would presume that a buyback is driven more by the strength of the underlying free cash flow and okay yes, you didn\u2019t deploy some cash in one direction but you were really looking at the integrity and the overall robustness of the free cash flow that supports the buyback.", "", "David E. Steiner", "No doubt about it. If you had to have, if you had to rank the factors, I would say the first factor is our strong, consistent cash flow. The second factor would be the stability of the credit markets so that, we certainly know that we can take care of our debt maturities and then the third factor would be we haven\u2019t spent as much money on things like acquisition and capital as we thought we were going to spend at the beginning of the year.", "", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "Can we get some trends with regards to what the pricing pattern and volume patterns were at the landfill side of the business?", "", "David E. Steiner", "Yeah, they were fairly consistent with where they were in the second quarter. When we look at the landfill, Michael, I like to look at MSW because special waste C & D, because special waste has so much mix involved in it and we really can\u2019t learn a lot by looking at the pricing trends. So when you look at MSW, what you see is that the pricing\u2019s been very consistent and the volume actually was a little better this quarter than it was in the first quarter, -8.1% in the first quarter, -5.8% in this quarter. So we actually saw a slight improvement. Now I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a big enough improvement for us to expect that to occur through the rest of the year. When you look at this business, Michael, you know as well as I do that the real factor that plays into the landfill lines is special waste. You\u2019re generally going to see more stability in MSW than you are in special waste. That\u2019s where we need to see, once we start seeing that start to uptick, that\u2019s when we can start to say landfill volumes are improving. We just haven\u2019t seen signs of that throughout the year.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "So is pricing positive in the landfill business?", "", "David E. Steiner", "Price is positive in the landfill business. ", "", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "I realize this is a real Ouija board aspect to this but there\u2019s cash for clunkers, $1 billion, $4,000 a car, that\u2019s 250,000 cars. Where\u2019s that flush in special waste and if all these cars really do get pulled in the next five months, four months based on the deadline, where does that flush show up if it\u2019s really going to happen?", "", "David E. Steiner", "Yeah, I know, it\u2019s interesting, Michael, as you follow the cash for clunkers, the so called cash for clunkers bill, because you have so many restrictions on it as far as the mileage per gallon, the age of the vehicle and a lot of different things like that, the numbers I\u2019ve seen actually aren\u2019t expecting it to have a dramatic effect on units sales for the car manufacturers. So I wouldn\u2019t expect to see a heck of a lot of incremental volume because of the cash for clunkers bill.", "", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "Okay, fair enough on that perspective but let\u2019s say it works and they really got the 250,000 cars in. How quickly does that convert into flush, how fast does the scrap steel market shred these things and the flush shows up?", "", "David E. Steiner", "That happens pretty fast. There\u2019s not a significant delay at all.", "", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "Next steps in China now that you had this great success with Shanghai Environmental?", "", "David E. Steiner", "We\u2019re negotiating the joint venture agreement. We expect to announce the conclusion of that hopefully in the near future. Then we proceed to put together the business plan. We expect at this point in time to be building somewhere between 2-4 plants, when we bid to build 2-4 plants per year. They\u2019ve already got some plants over there so we\u2019re jumping into it head first and we look forward to the opportunity. They are certainly the leading player in waste energy in China.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "Did you end up paying for the $140 million which was sort of estimated?", "", "David E. Steiner", "Yeah, that\u2019s exactly right. As I recall, the final number was about $143 million.", "", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "Then waste energy, can you share with us the total megawatts that are exposed to floating rates and how much are coming off contracted would it increase that rate of floating rates?", "", "David E. Steiner", "So when you look at, and its interesting Michael, when we talk about the China opportunity, we\u2019ve talked a lot about our European and China opportunities and those will have, we\u2019re bidding those with fixed energy price contracts. So you won\u2019t have that kind of fluctuation in China and in Europe. I don\u2019t know off the top of my head the megawatts but from a contractual point of view, as I said it went from 2% to 28%. In 2010, it will ramp up to about 45%  so I\u2019m not sure if our Wheelabrator folks measure that by megawatts or if they\u2019re measuring that by dollars but that\u2019s the percentage that we got from them.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ellis with Merrill Lynch.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "", "Just on landfills and I hear what you\u2019re saying about MSW versus special waste and the mix issue there, can you just quantify though first what was the whole landfill pricing year-over-year this quarter?", "", "David E. Steiner", "Overall landfill pricing from an IRG point of view, as I recall was 0.7%. That\u2019s obviously with the positive in MSW, basically flat at special waste and what we call revenue generating governed C&D.", "", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "If I\u2019m not mistaken, special waste can account for, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but as much as a third to 40% of your volume in the landfill at any given quarter?", "David E. Steiner", "Yeah, when you look at the landfill, we got special waste and then we got what we call revenue-generating cover, basically dirt job that we pick up and use as cover. When you look at that and you look at the shortfall that we had at our landfills in the second quarter which totaled about $60 million, $74 million if you look at the overall, that accounted for about 60% of the shortfall. That\u2019s why I say when you look at our landfills and you look at when this business will start to turn, you can\u2019t look at MSW. When you look at pricing, you got to look at MSW. When you look at when will the landfill start to turn, you\u2019ve got to look at those more economically sensitive lines like revenue-generating governed special waste. That\u2019s when, once you see that turn is when you\u2019ll see that huge leverage pop back down to our bottom line. ", "", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "If we can just turn our attention to fees. There has been a lot of discussion in the past about environmental fees and administrative fees. Do you have, if you could quantify maybe directionally, what portion of your IRG from yield this quarter came from the environmental fee and if you implemented the administrative fee at this point?", "", "David E. Steiner", "Yeah, when you look at the fees from a dollar point of view, between our environmental fee and our late fee it was about $57.5 million. The bulk of that, about $54.5 million comes from the environmental fee.", "", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Should we assume that the, I know you recently at the beginning of the year you landed an increase of about 6%. Should we assume that that has been fully rolled out, the environmental fee at 6% has been fully rolled out to the customer base at this point?", "", "David E. Steiner", "Yeah, you can pretty much assume that.", "", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Then just quickly on the free cash flow guidance, based on my calculations it seems that you\u2019re assuming about 40%-60% split in free cash flow this year between the first and second half. Based on my analysis, that is usually evenly split. Any particular reason why you\u2019re expecting free cash flow to ramp in the second half of this year?", "", "Robert G. Simpson", "Our CapEx spending was more weighted toward the first half of the year this year particularly with the fleet purchases, trying to get those in before the 2010 issues kick in.", "", "David E. Steiner", "We also at the beginning of the year had a carryover of roughly $200 million of capital that we had spent but hadn\u2019t paid so we had that carryover in the first quarter.", "", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Just finally, and I\u2019m not sure if you can or want to answer the question, but given that you\u2019ve given some sense in terms of how volumes should trend for the remainder of the year, vis-\u00e0-vis the second quarter, can you given us some sense and expectations for your IRG from yield, the reported core pricing for the remainder of the year for 3Q and 4Q at least directionally?", "", "David E. Steiner", "Yes, I can and want to answer that question so I\u2019ll affirmatively answer on both. Yeah, we expect our, and remember we\u2019ve also got our incentive plans set up to ensure that this happens. We\u2019ve got a gate deal with our yield that if we don\u2019t hit our yield gate, no one gets their annual bonus. So not only our expectations but our compensation is tied to the fact that we have to hit our IRG targets. I\u2019d certainly expect that IRG would remain consistent through the year if anything\u2019s going to improve. When I look at the three month trends, through the second quarter we actually hit our highest yield number in the third month of the quarter. So I certainly expect that we\u2019ll be right around that 3% range the entire year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley.", "Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley", "", "As you work through the contract changes for recycling, how cognizant would you say your customers are of the 40% increase in recycled commodity prices year-to-date? Does that throw a monkey wrench at all in what you hope to accomplish in the renegotiations?", "", "David E. Steiner", "Actually as we started talking to our customers about our new approach, it\u2019s been very well received. We\u2019re working our way through the customer base now but I would say that our customers want to see recycling continue to be viable and many municipalities saw what happened when some of the recyclers, when things got really bad, they weren\u2019t able to, people that they had contracted with, they began to have some problems. We got calls from folks because they didn\u2019t know what to do with their recycling commodities. So I would say overall people want to see recycling be a viable business and they realize in order to do that, processors like us have to at least make sure that our cost of processing is covered plus a fair return on our capital. Then we\u2019ll share the upside from there with the customer so the concept has been very well received.", "", "Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, that sounds very fair. Just regarding the return of the share buyback, could you just remind us what the rules are on blackout periods, what you can buy, when you can\u2019t, and how you plan to be opportunistic about it?", "", "David E. Steiner", "Yeah, generally we\u2019ve got our general counsel here, as I recall it\u2019s three days after we release earnings when we can get back into the market. We then close the window basically on the fifth day of the third month of the quarter. So what we generally do is we put in 10b5-1 programs to cover the blackout period where we\u2019ll buy a consistent amount through that period and then we can adjust it at various prices during that period.", "", "Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley", "Just one final question, can you provide some color around the competitive landscape for collection? Do you feel that competitive pressures are escalating on all as other players look to expand? Is that a recent development or would you say that the environment is more or less stable there?", "", "David E. Steiner", "I would say the environment\u2019s stable. Obviously, you see pockets where you see some unusual behaviors but overall that doesn\u2019t affect us. So I call it very stable.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Corey Greendale of First Analysis.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "", "Dave, you sort of answered this question just now but can you comment on changes in customer churn rates or are they stable?", "", "David E. Steiner", "Yeah, sequentially they\u2019re stable. We\u2019re at about 10.6% in the first quarter, we\u2019re at 10.7% in the second quarter. That is about 100 basis points change year-over-year. We were at 9.7% second quarter of \u201908. But it is stable with Q1.", "", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "When it\u2019s a positive and it\u2019s up year-over-year, do you think that\u2019s because of the little competitors being a little bit more aggressive?", "", "David E. Steiner", "No, no, 100 basis points isn\u2019t a dramatic change across our customer base. I think it\u2019s probably more a result of, our churn rate is both controllable and uncontrollable and so I think it\u2019s more a function of the economy than it is of competition.", "", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "You alluded to the yield gate on the incentive compensation. Do you expect that basically all the folks who have that in place are going to make the target?", "", "David E. Steiner", "At this point in time, everybody is making the target.", "", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "Can you just talk a little bit broadly about the, there was a time years ago when people looked at the recycling business as well you got to be in and the goal is just to minimize your losses, then more recently, last year it was talked about as a real opportunity you want to be investing in, where in that spectrum are you thinking about that business now?", "", "David E. Steiner", "I think that you have to look at recycling a little bit differently than you did 18 months ago. Obviously our results this year reflect it. But look, it\u2019s going to be here long-term. The communities want it. We need to look at it and say, not so much should we be in it or not be in it because we will be in it. We will stay in recycling. We need to look at it and say how do we control the volatility and commodity prices? That\u2019s why we\u2019re going back to our customers. Look, the reality is our customers understand that if they allow this volatility to occur, they\u2019re going to have peaks and valleys where they lose recycling assets. I don\u2019t think anybody wants that to happen. So that\u2019s why I think we\u2019re getting such good cooperation change on our pricing structure because they realize if we don\u2019t change the pricing structure, look a company like Waste Management can absorb those kind of losses. There are plenty of companies that can\u2019t absorb those kinds of losses and they\u2019re going to go out of business and there\u2019s going to be less recycling. We\u2019ll be in it long-term, we just need to make sure we can manage the volatility. Not only manage the volatility but when I say manage the volatility I mean manage the fact that when prices go down, we don\u2019t get hurt, but then when prices go up, we are able to take advantage when prices go up.", "", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "Just one last one, can I so far as, you took the high end of the free cash flow guidance range off the table and at the same time lowering the CapEx budget, is that purely because the economy\u2019s weaker than you expected it or it\u2019s all volume or what else? Is there anything else at this point to be affected by?", "", "Robert G. Simpson", "That\u2019s probably right. We gave a range at the beginning of the year that showed cash from ops varying at about $200 million. We cut that back, the top end of that range back about $150 million, maybe a little bit more to get to the number we\u2019re getting to. Part of it though is we don\u2019t expect our working capital benefit to be as strong as we had hoped at the beginning of the year so with managing the DSOs and DPOs is just a little bit harder with the DSOs in this environment. So we\u2019re thinking that that\u2019s probably not going to be as positive as we thought the beginning of the year.", "", "David E. Steiner", "When you look at where we thought the world would be at the beginning of the year certainly the volumes are lower than we thought they\u2019d be at the beginning of the year. But our pricing and cost programs have kept up with that. We\u2019ve been able to basically keep relatively flat year-over-year. We also knew that there was going to be by the time we came out in February, we certainly knew there was going to be a reduction in the recycling business. The one that frankly we didn\u2019t see at the beginning of the year was the waste-to-energy piece and with $22 million just in this quarter, we\u2019re talking about $0.04 more in the back half of the year plus energy prices in the first quarter, that\u2019s probably $50 million right there that comes out. So you got $50 million there, you got the thing Bob talked about, I think that sort of accounts for the difference.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Fisher with Raymond James.", "Bill Fisher - Raymond James", "", "I just wanted to slice the pricing a little different on that, you had a lot of success on the commercial side of the business, raising price, I\u2019m actually just wondering on the small competitor side if you\u2019re seeing them maybe be more capital constrained in terms of buying trucks, maybe on the one hand and then on the flipside maybe on the administrative or environmental fees, if you\u2019re getting some pushback on that side?", "David E. Steiner", "Yeah, Bill, I think it\u2019s a great point. I think everybody thought that going into this downturn that you\u2019d see the industry change its pricing approach and you haven\u2019t seen it. From my perspective, I always said that we can\u2019t let the small local competitors drive our pricing program. We have to drive our pricing program so we\u2019ve been able to do that and we haven\u2019t gotten a lot of pushback from customers. I think that we need to realize that the reason why we\u2019re able to basically hold the line in this environment is our pricing and cost programs. So folks understand that. We\u2019ve been at it a long enough period of time that folks aren\u2019t going to change the policy during the course of this year. Now, again, we ensured that it wasn\u2019t going to happen by making it a part of our annual incentive plan.", "", "Bill Fisher - Raymond James", "Just a follow-up on the Wheelabrator, do you feel like you spent maybe more effort on RFPs or maybe looking at acquisitions, I think I saw you were maybe a finalist on a facility in Virginia. I just ask the question because the RFPs if you want them are probably not a capital event for them where obviously the acquisitions would be quicker.", "", "Robert G. Simpson", "Yeah, that would be right and of course, I think we have enough free cash flow plus accessing the capital markers if necessary to do whatever we need to do this here.", "", "David E. Steiner", "It\u2019s important to note that, Bill, that with our Chinese joint venture, it will self-fund. So $143 million of our acquisition price from that point forward, it self-funds without any debt guaranteed by Waste Management so there won\u2019t be any debt incurred by us. There won\u2019t be any additional capital put into the entity by us so you\u2019re absolutely right. It shouldn\u2019t have a dramatic effect.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.", "Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank", "", "My questions have been answered but I\u2019d like to go into restructuring a little bit. I believe initial guidance was for $53 million for the full year 2009. It looks like you guys have done about $43 million. How do we think about the second half from a restructuring expense standpoint?", "", "Robert G. Simpson", "Nicole, I think we\u2019re thinking at this point that the additional expense we\u2019ll incur will be somewhere between $5-$10 million. So that $53 million number is the high end of where we think we\u2019ll end up.", "", "Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank", "Is that going to be split fairly evenly between the two quarters or would it be more heavily weighted towards the third quarter?", "", "Robert G. Simpson", "I think it\u2019s going to be more heavily weighted towards the third quarter.", "", "Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank", "You guys said you\u2019re currently seeing $30 million benefit per quarter. Should we expect an incremental step-up in 2010 or do you expect to run at that $120 million run rate going forward?", "", "Robert G. Simpson", "I think the $120 million number is what we\u2019re focused on.", "", "Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank", "How does that break down between structural versus temporary, i.e. how much of that restructuring benefit comes back when volumes start to improve?", "", "Robert G. Simpson", "Actually none of that should come back. The goal was to do the restructuring that gave us a permanent benefit. Other cost savings may come, that you\u2019ll see our performance may be more value-related, these are not.", "", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Brad Meeks with Morningstar.", "Brad Meeks \u2013 Morningstar", "", "Quick question for you, kind of an overreaching question, what gives you confidence that, this is kind of an overreaching theme, but that pricing will remain strong and you\u2019re not going to lose share to your smaller competitors or larger competitors over time?", "David E. Steiner", "I think two things again, I go back to our compensation plan. I think anytime that you want to drive behavior, if you build into your compensation plan, you\u2019ll be assured on driving behavior. But the second is frankly, the history of this industry. This is an industry that has now been very solid and very stable on pricing for three to four years. Look, there is no doubt that this industry started to see the economic downturn earlier than other industries in that our rollout volumes started running almost at double digit declines beginning in the first quarter of 2007-fourth quarter 2006. Our economically-sensitive roll-off line of business that now has been under pressure for roughly two and a half years, we continue to get up above 4% of price increases. What gives me the confidence frankly is the history of this industry over the last three to four years.", "", "Brad Meeks \u2013 Morningstar", "One last question. On the med waste contract, is there any chance, I assume it is not as high a priority as it was the first quarter to break into the med waste base, is this more organic than acquisition related?", "", "David E. Steiner", "I think that\u2019s a fair comment.", "", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. Are there any closing remarks?", "", "David E. Steiner", "No, thank you all for joining us and we look forward to seeing you on the road and having you join us on our third quarter conference call.

Mr. Alderson, you may begin your conference.", "James Alderson", "Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2009 earnings conference call. With me this morning are David Steiner, Chief Executive Officer; Larry O\u2019Donnell, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Simpson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "David will start things off with a summary of the financial results for the quarter and a review of the details of our revenue growth, including price and volume trends. Larry will discuss operating costs, and Bob will cover the financial statement. We will conclude with questions and answers.", "During their statements any comparisons made by David, Bob, or Larry unless otherwise stated will be with the third quarter of 2008.", "Before we get started, let me remind you that in addition to our press release that was issued this morning, we have filed a Form 8-K that includes the press release as an attachment and is available on our website at wm.com. The Form 8-K, the press release and the schedule to the release include important information that you should refer to.", "We have given detailed information on all of the non-GAAP measures that will be discussed on this morning\u2019s call, and have reconciled them to the most comparable GAAP measures, and you can find that information in the schedules for the earnings press release and the Form 8-K filed today, which can be found on the company\u2019s website at wm.com.", "Additionally, during the call you will hear certain forward-looking statements concerning our plans and expectations for the fourth quarter and full-year 2009. Actual results could differ materially from our plans and expectations. Certain factors related to future expectations are detailed in our press release this morning and in our filings with the Securities & Exchange Commission, including the Form 10-K filed for 2008.", "This call is being recorded and will be available 24 hours a day beginning approximately 1 pm Eastern time today until 5 pm Eastern time on November 12.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of Waste Management is prohibited.", "Now, I will turn the call over to Waste Management CEO David Steiner.", "David Steiner", "Thanks, Jim and good morning from Houston.", "When we look at the quarter, we see that our core solid waste operations continue to benefit from our pricing and cost programs. Our success is proven by the fact that despite an 8.9% decline in volume, our operational earnings were flat year-over-year. In other words, if we start with $0.54 as adjusted and add back $0.09 of non-operational impacts from our recycling and waste-to-energy operations mentioned in our press release, we would have matched as adjusted prior year earnings, again despite volume losses of 8.9%.", "This shows the strength of our core operating model, which focuses on pricing and operational excellence. We would expect the fourth quarter of this year to follow a similar pattern. Our pricing and cost programs will make up for volume losses, but we shouldn't see a significant drag from those non-operational items. With year-over-year declines in our waste-to-energy business likely being offset by year-over-year benefits in our recycling operations.", "Consequently, we are confident that we can meet the Wall Street consensus of $0.48 per diluted share in the fourth quarter. I'm pleased that we achieved solid third quarter results given this challenging economic environment. We maintained our focus on pricing and achieved internal revenue growth from yield, on our collection and disposal business of 2.9%. We realized the full benefit of our reorganization announced in February, and are on pace to exceed our original target of $120 million in annualized savings.", "We increased productivity in our (inaudible) and residential collections lines of business. We have seen some positive signs on the macroeconomic front with recycling commodity prices increasing each month since the lows reached in January. Natural gas prices, which affect the electricity sales in some of our waste-to-energy plants, have rebounded well in the last two months. Collection and disposal volumes have stabilized, which should lead to slightly better year-over-year volumes comparisons beginning in the fourth quarter of this year and continuing into 2010.", "Looking at revenue, in the third quarter revenue declined by $502 million, but most of the decline was a result of items that do not relate to our solid waste collection and disposal operations, $189 million of the decline was due to recycling revenues and electricity sale prices, $108 million was related to the decline in fuel surcharge revenues as oil prices declined, and $10 million was related to foreign currency translation. This leads our third quarter 2009 revenue decline related to our solid waste collection and disposal business of about $195 million or approximately 5.5% of revenue.", "Pricing continued to be strong and consistent. Internal revenue growth from collection and disposal yield in the third quarter was 2.9%. Internal revenue growth from yield was strongest in the three collection lines of business. Combined, the revenue growth from yield in the industrial, commercial and residential lines of our collection business was 3.9% in the third quarter. We again produced our strongest results in our commercial collection line of business, where internal revenue growth from yield was 4.4% in the quarter. The yield components of internal revenue growth in our industrial and residential lines of business were 3.8% and 3.5%, respectively.", "Internal revenue growth from volumes declined 8.9% in the quarter. The recession-resistant lines of our business, mainly commercial and residential collection, saw volume declines of 5.3% and 3.7%, similar to what we\u2019ve seen in recent quarters. In our more economically sensitive roll-off line of business, volumes were off 18.2%. Despite lower volumes, we maintained our focus on roll-off pricing, which resulted in revenue growth from yield of 3.8% for the quarter. We\u2019ve continued to work to obtain price increases in our roll-off line despite lower volumes and certainly we will continue that strategy. Overall, we expanded our income from operations margin in the collection line of business by 200 basis points.", "Turning to yield and volume on the disposal side of the business, third quarter 2009 internal revenue growth from volume decreased by 19.7%. The softness occurred primarily in our more economically sensitive special waste and C&D line. Internal revenue growth from volume for special waste was negative 20.5% and for C&D, it was negative 25.8%. For MSW internal revenue growth from volume was negative 6.3%.", "On the pricing front, pricing was strongest in our MSW line with per unit pricing up by 2.9%. Again, we\u2019ll maintain our focus on MSW pricing despite the lower volumes.", "The recycling markets have shown significant improvement since January of this year with commodity prices rising on average over 80% between January and September. Even with this improvement, however, average commodity prices were down approximately 40% in the third quarter of 2009. This decline in commodity prices caused a negative year-over-year impact to earnings of $0.05 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2009, consistent with our expectations. For the fourth quarter of 2009, we are anticipating a positive impact to earnings per diluted share of $0.02 to $0.04 in our recycling line of business as we anniversary the steep decline in commodity prices that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2008.", "In our waste-to-energy operations, we anticipate a negative impact from electricity sale prices of between $0.02 and $0.04 during the fourth quarter of 2009. While natural gas prices have increased over 150% from the lows reached in September, we expect Q4 2009 prices to be lower on average than Q4 2008 prices by approximately 30%. In addition, the percentage of power sold on a merchant basis increased to 43% during the third quarter.", "On a combined basis, we anticipate that our recycling commodity and electricity sales will offset each other for a net breakeven impact in the fourth quarter of 2009. As we look to the fourth quarter, we anticipate that year-over-year volume comparisons should start to improve. However, we will face some headwinds due to the volumes we received during the fourth quarter of 2008 in the aftermath of hurricane Ike, which increased internal volume growth from volumes for disposal by 250 basis points and for collection and disposal by 40 basis points.", "So looking at overall volumes for the fourth quarter, we expect the rate of decline to be slightly better than the third quarter of 2009. Given our assumptions, we remain confident that our full-year as adjusted earnings will fall within our previously announced range of $1.95 to $1.99 per diluted share. This is consistent with the current Wall Street consensus of $0.48 per share for the fourth quarter of 2009.", "As you all know, our capital allocation program over the past few years has been very clear, return cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, while opportunistically acquiring assets. We resumed our share repurchase program during the third quarter, and as of today we have repurchased over $100 million of our common stock for the year. In the quarter, we paid $143 million in dividends, and we closed on $82 million of acquisitions, primarily in our collection line of business that will add about $53 million of annualized revenue, and we continue to see good acquisition opportunities.", "It is truly an exciting time to be at waste management, and we look forward to entering 2010 with the momentum that we expect to build throughout the year. And with that I will turn the call over to Larry.", "Lawrence O\u2019Donnell", "Thank you, David, and good morning. I will begin by reviewing our operating cost results for the third quarter of 2009.", "Operating expenses in the third quarter of 2009 were $1.856 billion or 61.4% of revenues, an improvement of $365 million from the third quarter of 2008 or 160 basis points as a percent of revenue. This is another strong performance given the year-over-year decline in revenue.", "The cost reduction is due primarily to three factors. First, flexing down costs and executing our restructuring plan that we put in place at the beginning of the year. Second, lower recycling commodity prices, which resulted in lower rebates we pay to our customers; and third, lower fuel costs from the decline in diesel fuel prices.", "I continue to be pleased with the way our team has actively managed down our operating costs during these tough economic conditions. Our new organizational structure that we implemented at the beginning of the year has enabled us to quickly react to the lower volumes by flexing down our costs, while continuing our operational improvements in the areas of safety, fleet maintenance, productivity, and service to our customers. I believe we are in a great position to leverage our cost structure when the economy recovers.", "I will now review our performance from the third quarter of 2009 compared with the prior year period in a number of the cost categories. Labor and employee benefits\u2019 cost improved by $59 million in the quarter. $21 million of this improvement relates to costs incurred in the third quarter last year in labor actions in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with most of that cost related to the withdrawal from Teamsters\u2019 underfunded Central States Pension Fund.", "The remainder of this improvement results primarily from reducing routes in reaction to the volume declines, achieving productivity improvements and labor cost savings that resulted from our restructuring that we implemented at the beginning of the year.", "We reduced our driver hours by about 915,000 hours by taking trucks off the road as volumes declined, using our routing tool to rebuild more efficient routes and achieving continued productivity improvements.", "Transfer and disposal expenses, which include those costs that our collection companies pay to third-party landfills and transfer stations improved by $32 million primarily due to volume declines and our continued focus on managing down our third-party disposal costs.", "We lowered our maintenance and repair costs in total by $13 million in the third quarter of 2009 compared to the prior year period as a result of continued reduction in collection truck and heavy equipment fleet maintenance. With the lower volumes, we have parked trucks and we have taken heavy equipment out of service. We have also adjusted our operating hours at our landfills and transfer stations. Our standardized preventive maintenance program has also contributed to the reduction in our fleet maintenance cost.", "Subcontractor costs improved by $59 million in the third quarter of 2009 due to using fewer third-party contractors as a result of lower volumes, negotiating down our third-party transportation costs and decreases in the indirect fuel costs passed on to us by our subcontract haulers as a result of lower diesel fuel prices. Cost of goods sold decreased by $103 million, principally due to the reduction of recycling commodity rebates we paid to our recycling customers as a result of lower recycling commodity prices. We also benefited from the implementation of our new recycling pricing and rebate program that is designed to allow us to recover our processing costs and earn a return on our investments before we share the upside on commodity prices with customers.", "We lowered our direct fuel costs by approximately $95 million compared to the third quarter of 2008, as a result of lower diesel fuel prices and using less fuel as volumes declined. The average diesel fuel price was $1.72 lower per gallon in the third quarter of 2009 compared to the same period last year. Indirect fuel costs charged to us by our subcontract transfer station haulers declined by approximately $12 million. As I mentioned in the past, our fuel surcharge programs continue to keep pace with changes in our direct and indirect diesel fuel costs over time.", "Everything we have accomplished with our restructuring has enabled us to become even more pro-active in managing our costs and efficiently adjusting our operations to match our volumes. This will serve us well as we head into the winter months. I'd like to congratulate our team for the outstanding job they continue to do in a very tough economic environment. We expect the momentum we are created to continue into the fourth quarter and into 2010, and we are well positioned to leverage our cost structure as the economy recovers.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bob.", "Bob Simpson", "Thank you, Larry. I\u2019d like to start out by discussing SG&A costs. These costs decreased by $30 million to $339 million during the third quarter of 2009. This decrease is due primarily to labor cost savings that resulted from our restructuring announced in February of this year. Also contributing to the decrease are lower long-term incentive plan expenses, lower bad debt expenses and reductions in advertising and travel expenses resulting from our focus on cost control.", "Bad debt expense decreased by almost $4 million for the quarter and our days sales outstanding were essentially flat. We believe that this is a good result, particularly given the economy and we will continue managing all of our receivables very closely.", "Depreciation and amortization expense for the third quarter of 2009 declined to $25 million when compared with the third quarter of 2008, principally as a result of lower landfill volumes. As a percentage of revenue, depreciation and amortization expense was 10% compared with 9.2% in the prior year quarter with the increase primarily due to the decline in revenue. Our interest expense declined in the third quarter year-over-year by $10 million primarily due to lower interest rates as well as lower debt levels. Our debt to total capital ratio was 55.8%, well below our target ratio of 60%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 28% at the end of the quarter.", "Moving to income taxes, in the third quarter of 2009, our effective tax rate was approximately 31.2%. The decrease in our tax rate is primarily the result of the finalization of our 2008 tax return in favorable tax audit settlements. It was also impacted by the recognition of state net operating losses previously unrecognized, as well as updating our effective tax rate. We expect our fourth quarter 2009 effective tax rate to be 36.8%.", "Turning to cash flow, third quarter 2009 net cash provided by operating activities was $575 million. Our capital expenditures for the quarter were about $240 million, a decrease of $61 million compared with the prior year period.", "Our free cash flow for the quarter was approximately $343 million, and our free cash flow for the first three quarters is $839 million. In order to meet our full year free cash flow target of 1.3 billion, during the fourth quarter of 2009 we will need to produce strong income from operations and closely manage our working capital and capital expenditures. We paid $143 million in dividends in the quarter and purchased as of today over $100 million of our common stock this year. Our dividend yield is currently 3.8%. It takes each and every employee to be engaged in servicing our customers every day to be successful, and again this quarter our employees have met the task. We thank them for their dedication. And with that, Nicole, let\u2019s open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Richard Skidmore with Goldman Sachs.", "Richard Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Good morning. Thank you. Perhaps you could just elaborate a little bit more on your use of free cash flow between now and the end of the year, and also the free cash flow guidance. It seems like a pretty big step up in the fourth quarter versus what you have been doing over the last couple of quarters. Can you just elaborate on how you expect that you can get to that 460 that you need to get your target?", "David Steiner", "You know, Richard. (inaudible) on a good conversion ratio of our income from operations and turning it into cash. And we typically in the fourth quarter over the last few years have been between 120% and 130% of converting our income from operations into cash from ops.", "And then we just got to be really tight on working capital and on CapEx. We expect it to be a challenge, but we think it is something that is achievable.", "Richard Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And then just on the share repurchase, I thought I understood that the plan was 400 million of share repurchase by year-end \u201909, is that still the target, or was I just mistaken?", "David Steiner", "We are authorized to do 400 million, but you know managing our cash in this kind of an environment is important to us. So we haven't gone in as aggressively as we might. I think we're on pace right now to do 250 million, 300 million shares, probably closer to 250. But if circumstances present a real opportunity, we would certainly increase that. But we do want to continue to look for acquisitions and other opportunities as well.", "Richard Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thank you.", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley.", "Vance Edelson \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Hi, thanks a lot. Could you just provide some color around how easy it is to raise prices, how competitive is the environment, are customers very receptive to that and what gives the commercial business particular strength there?", "David Steiner", "Yes, you know, Vance I wouldn't say that there has been a dramatic change. I mean you would expect there to be a dramatic change, maybe with the -- what the economy has gone through in the last year, but frankly we haven't seen a dramatic change in our ability to continue to raise prices. You know on the commercial side, I think a good portion of it is that we provide certainly the best service in the industry, but also when you are getting a 4.4% price increase on a fairly low base with that average customer being somewhere in the $300 to $500, it doesn't appear as such a large price increase.", "So -- and you\u2019ll have heard me say it hundreds of times, it is not just as simple as putting out a 4.4% price increase across the board and hoping that it sticks. There is a science to pricing, and we\u2019ve got a group here that applies that science better than anyone. So we certainly expect to keep that price even if the economy continues to be weak, and we expect it to accelerate if the economy gets better.", "Vance Edelson \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay that is great, and then just on the cost side, since you are exceeding the target of $120 million in annual savings, should we expect more going forward, maybe just remind us where you are in the overall process of becoming more efficient in reducing those costs.", "Bob Simpson", "Yes, we have been running about $10 million a month. We saw a little bit more than that in this last quarter, but we still think we're going to continue on that same pace. We will slightly exceed our original target, but we continue to look for ways to drive out even additional cost as we go forward.", "Lawrence O\u2019Donnell", "You know, Vance it's important to think of it as two types of costs. There is both restructuring costs of 120, which we took out and that's out permanently. Then there is the other cost we got from flexing down and while most of the flexing down came through in operating expenses, there was some of that in SG&A as well. And I think it is just a matter of keeping those two buckets separate in your mind.", "David Steiner", "And I'd add lastly Vance that you know, it's interesting that as you go out and talk to the folks in the field, generally at this time of the year when they see the seasonal downturn coming they're a little bit slow to react because they want to make sure if they can cover volumes. After what we saw last year, where like everybody else our volumes fell off dramatically in October. What we are seeing this year is that our field is starting to flex down cost anticipating the seasonal downturn. So I think Bob and Larry are exactly right. We've hit that cost category in every direction, and we continue that -- we expect that to continue.", "Vance Edelson \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks guys.", "David Steiner", "Thanks Vance.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Wunderlich Securities.", "David Steiner", "Good morning Michael.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "How are you all?", "David Steiner", "Good.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Seasonality, you know, we didn't have as much in the third, but you always get some down in the fourth. So we should think about revenues are going to be down sequentially as part of this model, right?", "David Steiner", "Certainly we do expect that, yes.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Okay. On the recycling side it was just about this time a year ago that the Chinese just kind of pulled the plug. You know, any -- and it's all about consumer electronics. Any sort of visibility through your brokerage business or anything on the know, how the Chinese are behaving and you know, I realized you'd given us guidance that it's going to offset, but what gives you confidence the Chinese just don't pull the plug again?", "Lawrence O\u2019Donnell", "Well, what we've seen you know, ever since the lows in January, as we have seen continued you know, increases in the commodity prices. You know, we saw OCC pull back just a little bit in October, but it wasn't that much. You know, I guess anything can happen, but we certainly think that we\u2019ll continue to see improvement out of our recycling operations just like we said in our press release and in our remarks.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Okay, and then --", "David Steiner", "Michael, I think China is certainly driven by the macroeconomic factors in China, and I certainly haven't seen anything that would indicate that the pace of growth in China is going to slow.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Okay. That's good to know too. You know, plugging in on the volume issue, do have a dollar amount that I reflected in the fourth quarter because as you think about sort of doing your modeling. I mean if you employ hike out [ph] and then have a normalized, what would the change be?", "David Steiner", "Michael, as we said it was 250 basis points of volume at the land fills and 40 basis points of volume at the overall collection and disposal line. We didn't translate that into dollars, but you know, basically what we're seeing right now is that the volumes through October are fairly consistent with what they've been in the third quarter where we are going to get the volumes as we said slightly improve the rate of decline in the fourth quarter.", "It is because again last year just like commodity prices dropped off the face of the earth in October, volumes dropped off the face of the earth in October. So the comps get much easier going forward. So what we've seen so far frankly has been fairly consistent with what we've seen through the rest of the year, but November and December clearly volumes should you know, if they continue what we've seen through the quarter sort of flat throughout the last 18 to 20 weeks. If they continue with that and have sort a normal seasonal downturn, they should be much better than they were in November-December last year.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Okay, and then on the waste energy business, I mean the model so far on the merchandise has been to sell on a day rate basis. Is that changing with regards to trying to capture even if it is out six or nine months, a little bit of that forward curve because there is pretty good contango there going on.", "David Steiner", "Yes, and we have not looked at locking in those yet Michael. We wanted to see the natural gas prices, look they're up 150% of their lows, but they are still down about 40% year-over-year, and so we wanted to wait until -- we think at least short term with winter months coming up that you won't see natural gas prices drop dramatically. So before we lock-in, we want to make sure that we are locking in at the best rates we can.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Okay and then can we talk a little bit Larry about you know, low inflation, low growth environment. How would you think about capital spending as a percent of revenues in that kind of environment? You know maybe you have run 9%, 10% historically but you've had some inflation in that and more growth, organic growth in the economy. Those are all low or almost zero. What do you think about cap spending as a percent of revenues?", "Lawrence O\u2019Donnell", "Well, you know, a big part of our -- the two big components on our capital spending, first landfills and that's going to be really driven by what the volumes are. So you know, we've gotten really good at almost building out volumes or sales just-in-time. So that will be reflected with what we see in volumes, and on the trucking container side I mean you know, we parked up and talking about, we parked a lot of trucks this past year as well as containers, and while we filled some of those older assets, you know, we've also made sure we've parked and put off to the side.", "So those be ready to go if we see volumes pick up, some of that equipment both trucks and heavy equipment. So you know, I could see it is next year not spending as much on trucks as we did. You know, this current year, but we are going to monitor that. We are going to make sure we're managing you know, our capital in the right way given what the economic conditions are.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "So, 8.5%, 9% is not an unrealistic number given that way you've just described that?", "Lawrence O\u2019Donnell", "It could be in that range. I mean we're going to just kind of see how the year plays out and you know, just like what we've done this year, we are going to -- we've got our hand on the lever and we're going to adjust to whatever the economic conditions present to it.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Okay, back to again disposal, you know, realized front-end loader business you got servicing real changes. So in the mix through the first nine months, but everything goes across to scale. Are you seeing on your trucks any increased tonnage out of your front-end loader business that supports some of the commentary that the consumer has shown a little bit of life and it might not be revenues yet, but you're at least getting incremental tonnage.", "David Steiner", "Yes, Michael what we see is that actually the tons per haul are down slightly in the commercial business, basically flat in the roll-off business, but the amount that they are down has improved each quarter during the course of the year. So, certainly that's a positive trend.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Okay, and then Bob on the cost side what's your visibility or thoughts on the flexion part as the business starts to grow again. You know, how long do you think you can hold on to not, because your two biggest components are labor and your disposals. How long do you hold on not having to add labor as you get growth? How should we think about that, you know, 3% to 4% top line and you can hold the labor tight or is it, where is that number flexion?", "Bob Simpson", "Michael, I've continued to say that I think we are going to be able to leverage our cost structure. You know, one thing that we did when I got with the group SVPs and we came up with this model to use in the restructuring. One thing we wanted to make sure we did was restructure in a way that would position us well when the economy did come back. And so I think we've got a cost structure that's going to serve us well when the economy you know, starts to -- we start seeing real signs of growth and you know, it's certainly our intention to leverage that cost structure and continue to see benefits from that.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Okay. And David, I have to ask the medical waste question. So how are we doing progress wise, I saw you announced an acquisition (inaudible), it was little, but you know what sort of the visibility on the progress towards your $300 million in revenues.", "David Steiner", "Yes, you know, Michael as you point out we did do a small acquisition and it's certainly going to take time. We are not going to get the $300 million in revenue overnight, but what we're seeing as far as we start to build out the network and the customers receiving our offer has been very encouraging. So we look forward to building that business.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Okay. Well nice job on the numbers.", "David Steiner", "Thank you Michael.", "Bob Simpson", "Thank you Michael.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Credit Suisse.", "David Steiner", "Good morning Hamzah.", "Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Good morning. Thank you. Just -- on your waste-to-energy business, could you comment on your acquisition pipeline there? You know, it looks like there are a number of projects, both domestically and internationally, and you know, how much capital are you putting towards those efforts? How many bids are you looking at right now? And also just remind us what you're contracts are struck on the Wheelabrator business, and is 43% exposure the right number to market in 2010 or is that 50%?", "Bob Simpson", "Yes, the 43 moves to about 48 to 50 in 2010. So not a dramatic move in 2010, and we'll talk about the growth, sort of by country. You all saw our announcement on our acquisition of 40% interest in Shanghai Environment in China. That will be about $145 million. It's in the normal review process right now in China. It has to be approved by the government like any transaction with a partnership with a foreign partner, and so you know, we expect that to close sometime in the first quarter of 2010.", "Again that'll be about $145 million. It won't have exposure to merchant power because the waste contract and the electricity contract are locked in. And in Europe, we continue to bid for projects. We've been short listed on a number, but we haven't won any of those projects yet, and so once that happens we'll report that, and in the United States there are two or three projects that we believe that we are the primary party that's being looked at to build those plants.", "You know, obviously we will announce those as we can. We\u2019ve probably seen some press on some of the plants that we are looking on building in Baltimore, and then recently we bid to purchase a plant that we refer to as SIPSA [ph] in the southeast for about $150 million. So, when you look at you know, sort of the current outlay as we look to build plants, whether it is domestically or internationally in Europe or in the United States, obviously the cash outlays for those won't be for a number of years, because as we win the bids, it will be 3 to 4 years before we finalize construction. The two that we will put money out currently, you know, would be China at $145 million, SIPSA at about $150 million.", "Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, great. And then on the volume side are you guys seeing any additional signs of volume stabilization, which are different from last quarter or you're just seeing the same thing?", "David Steiner", "No, you know, from a volume perspective what we are saying is basically, it has really been interesting that what we've seen over the last, probably 20 weeks has basically been sort of a flat line of volumes now, given that that flat line dropped off dramatically in October of last year, we would be thrilled to death if that continues through the fourth quarter, but what we've seen is basically the volume stabilized and that gives us the confidence to believe that the volumes or the rate of decline is going to be better in the fourth quarter than it was in the third.", "But, you know, we also look at some other signs. You know, Michael asked about the tons per haul or other measures of tons per unit, and then we also look at our net service increases versus our net service decreases. And our net service increases -- our net service increases net of our service decreases were basically flat this quarter, down $100,000. That compares with being down anywhere from $1 million to $1.5 million in the prior three quarters. So the signs that we see show again stabilization in the volumes. We are not expecting the volumes to come roaring back like they were in 2007, but we certainly see stability, and given the year-over-year comps stability would be a very good thing.", "Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse", "I will let some other people ask questions. I'll get back in the queue. Thank you.", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Levine with JP Morgan.", "David Steiner", "Good morning Scott.", "Scott Levine \u2013 JP Morgan", "Good morning guys. How are you doing?", "David Steiner", "Good.", "Scott Levine \u2013 JP Morgan", "A couple quick ones for you. Geographically were there any unusual trends or notables more accurate trends either positive or negative in any of your regions that will be noteworthy either on the volume or the price side?", "Bob Simpson", "No, nothing of note at all. There is a slight difference right now, and, you know, as you'd imagine the economies were hurt more in the South and the West than they were in the Midwest and the East, because there were falling from a higher perch if you will, and so you see a slight difference in the South and the West but nothing that I would call dramatic or that I would say as a trend. So really no big regional differences.", "Scott Levine \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay, and then following up on the uses of cash question earlier, you guys last couple of years I think have made an announcement on your dividend in the month of December or late in the year, any thoughts on how that fits into your cash flow usage decision-making?", "David Steiner", "Yes, certainly Scott. You're exactly right. This is the time of year, we have a board meeting in November and another board meeting in December. The December meeting is generally when we present our capital plan for 2010 and so any announcement that we make with respect to the capital plan would occur after that meeting.", "Scott Levine \u2013 JP Morgan", "With regard to the guidance or the implied guidance in the fourth quarter as well, could you tell us, I don't know if you mentioned earlier Bob the tax rate you're assuming?", "Bob Simpson", "Yes, I did mention. It is 36.8.", "Scott Levine \u2013 JP Morgan", "And is that a good one to think about for 2010 preliminarily?", "Bob Simpson", "I think for 2010 you're probably going to see something more at 37ish, but we'll give some guidance on that Scott after we finish our budgets in due for the year, but it will be a little bit north of what we talked about today.", "Scott Levine \u2013 JP Morgan", "Very good, and then without asking for guidance on 2010 obviously, what preliminary thoughts could you offer in terms of the business outlook or is really the expectation, a reasonable expectation at this point to kind of think about stability on both, stability on the volume side. Were the volumes really more a function of math than anything else and then pricing just kind of remaining disciplined, but other folks have really talked to falling CPIs weighing on the reported growth rate. Any commentary you could give would be appreciated.", "David Steiner", "Just, you know, Scott it's like I said earlier, from a pricing perspective we don't see us going backward on price. The only way we see us going is forward. If the economy is more robust in 2010 than we expect, we'll do better on pricing. So we don't see us going backward on pricing. From a volume point of view, I think you've hit the nail right on the head. Stability is the word, and if we can see stable volumes you know, we would fully expect the year-over-year comps in the sort of the first half of the year to be less negative than they were this year, and then we think there could be some actual volume growth in the second half of the year. So we're just looking forward to starting 2010.", "Scott Levine \u2013 JP Morgan", "That is it. Thanks guys.", "David Steiner", "Thanks Scott.", "Bob Simpson", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ellis with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.", "David Steiner", "Good morning Jon.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Good morning guys. First of all, just you've given the pricing for MSW to landfills. Could you also, normally you provide overall landfill pricing and then pricing for C&D or special waste.", "David Steiner", "Yes, the overall pricing of the landfill on an IRG reported basis, not on per unit basis is about 1%, and on special waste it was basically flat. Both C&D and special waste were basically flat, slightly positive but you know, 0.2%, 0.3%, but basically flat.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. And then just on the environmental fee, can you provide us the -- if you have it handy, the dollar contribution this quarter. Also any thoughts on you know, whether you may look to raise the environment fee again next year?", "Bob Simpson", "Yes, the contribution -- the year-over-year increase is about $9.8 million. The total contribution is about $56 million. You know, we are now at 6% on the environmental fee. You know, I certainly don't see. We have not again looked at our 2010 plan. We'll do that in December. But I certainly don't think that that you'll see a dramatic increase in that.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. The -- just there was a reference to CPI from an earlier question, but I guess if you can help us kind of ring-fence what the potential risk is. Do you have a number in terms of percentage of revenues tied to municipal contracts, where there is some kind of inflation escalator, and you know, to what extent you think you can kind of negotiate if in fact, you know, CPI for the full year is negative?", "Bob Simpson", "Yes, I mean. I don't know about you all, but I haven't seen CPI for the full-year going negative on this yet. You know, we have about $3 billion of municipal business. You know, most of that $3 billion is going to be tied to CPI or PPI. You know, I'm not sure that we are going to see negative CPI, and mind you that not all of those contracts allow for the price to go backwards. A lot of those contracts only contemplate positive CPI. So again you know, if we see CPI going backwards to where it becomes negative, then that's something we are going to have to address with our municipalities but look these are long-term contracts that we signed up too and we're just going to have to make that up somewhere else.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just, quickly turning your attention to profitability and you know, normally looking at things on a sequential basis is dangerous in this industry given the lack of seasonality this year, I figure it would be somewhat appropriate to compare 2Q and 3Q, and I did notice that there was some up-tick in the selling expense between 2Q and 3Q this year. Any particular reason for that, where there changes in accruals or deferred compensation anything on those lines?", "Bob Simpson", "Actually, but [ph] for a reversal of our long-term incentive plan accrual in the second quarter, the amount of the reductions are just about the same. I think we didn't have that long-term incentive plan accrual benefit in the second quarter and plus a few smaller items, we would have been at the same rate than as we are in this quarter. So it's really been no change.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys.", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "Bob Simpson", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Bill Fisher with Raymond James.", "Bill Fisher \u2013 Raymond James", "Good morning.", "David Steiner", "Good morning Bill.", "Bob Simpson", "Good morning Bill.", "Bill Fisher \u2013 Raymond James", "Yes, I just -- first you guys have done a great job on the labor productivity, obviously through the downtown and obviously have some leverage when the economy improves. Do you see -- are there any other initiatives you are looking at or you can talk about on that front that might help you, you know, if volumes are more sluggish or stable or whatnot?", "Bob Simpson", "Well, couple of things. One, you know, we put in place a whole new labor management tool that I think has really helped our field adjust their labor cost and in the number of heads they need on a much more current basis than we had before. The other thing we have is a routing tool that we've updated that the field is using and, you know, they are constantly as you might imagine with that much volume change and are changing constantly, all of our operations are in a constant state of rerouting.", "You know, they just never, they never stop. I think with those two tools, it helps us not only as we see the downturn but I think it's going to help us when we start seeing increases in activity to better manage our costs than we were able to do before. On the maintenance side you know, there is still opportunity there. We continue to standardize our fleets, standardize our maintenance practices, and that's one of the reasons that we been able to continue to see those costs going down, even when we were in an inflationary environment.", "So I think there is still continued opportunity for us there as well. Productivity, you know, with the focus that we've had on improving our efficiency, and that doesn't mean driving faster. We've really analyzed our routes and found ways to drive out inefficiencies. We'll continue to do that. So, you know, we've got a lot of levers at our disposal on the operations side that you know, I think there is continued opportunity for us to improve our cost structure, even if activity stayed at the same level that we are seeing now.", "Bill Fisher \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay, great. And just totally different thing on that, you mentioned a lot of detail on the natural gas prices and impact on waste energy. Do you feel those have negatively impacted the landfill gas business or is that just too immaterial or kind of hard to isolate?", "David Steiner", "Clearly they would have affected it, but not anything again. You're right. It's not material for the results.", "Bill Fisher \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "David Steiner", "Thank you Bill.", "Bob Simpson", "Thank you Bill.", "David Steiner", "You know, when we look at the quarter, virtually all of the trends that we follow are positive, and the cost actions that we took this year are going to continue into the fourth quarter and into 2010. So we look forward to a strong fourth quarter and a return to growth and profitability in 2010. And with that Nicole, we\u2019ll say goodbye to all and see you on the road.", "Operator", "Thank you for participating in today's Waste Management third quarter 2009 conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the second quarter 2010 earnings release conference call. (Operator Instructions). I\u2019ll now turn the conference over to Mr. Jim Alderson, Director, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.", "Jim Alderson", "Thank you, Tia. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2010 earnings conference call. With me this morning are David Steiner, Chief Executive Officer and Bob Simpson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "David will start things off with the summary of the financial results for the quarter and a review of the details of our revenue growth including price and volume trends. Bob will cover the financial statement. We will conclude with questions and answers.", "During their statements any comparisons made by David and Bob, unless otherwise stated will be with the second quarter of 2009. Before we get started, let me remind you that in addition to our press release that was issued this morning, we have filed a Form 8-K that includes the press release as an attachment and is available on our website at wm.com. The Form 8-K, the press release and the schedules to the release include important information that you should refer to.", "In some cases, David and Bob will discuss our results on as adjusted basis including net income, earnings per diluted share, which they may refer to as EPS, operating expenses, effective tax rate and income from operations margin. These financial measures have been adjusted for items management believes do not reflect their fundamental business performance and are not indicative of our results of operation.", "All of these measures in addition to free cash flow are non-GAAP measures and you can find reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures in this schedule to the earning press release which can be found attached to the Form 8-K file today and on the company\u2019s website at wm.com.", "Additionally, during the call, you will hear certain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, opinion or belief of our future period.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the express written consent Waste Management is prohibited.", "Now I will turn the call over to Waste Management CEO David Steiner.", "David Steiner", "Thank you, Jim and good morning from Houston. We earned $0.54 per share in the second quarter consistent with our quarter and full-year expectations. We did this despite a $0.01 headwind from accounting adjustments related to remediation reserves at our (inaudible) and a $0.01 headwind from increased advertising relating to our new Bagster product. We also continue to see positive signs in volumes that point to further volume improvements throughout the remainder of the year which reinforces our belief that we see will volumes turn positive in the second half of the year.", "Revenue increased by $206 million or 7% from the prior-year period. This is the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. Major drivers of our revenue improvement were improved recycling commodity prices, acquisitions and year-over-year increases in revenue growth from yield.", "Internal revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal operation was 2.3% in the second quarter, a marked improvement compared with the first quarter of 2010. Through our discipline and focus on pricing, we overcame much of the first half affect of low and even negative consumer price indices.", "As you all know our municipal and franchise contracts are generally adjusted based upon a CPI index. Approximately 35% of our overall collection business is from municipal and franchise contracts. Due to the low to negative CPI in the second half of 2009, the contracts that adjusted at the end of 2009 contributed much less to our pricing results than in prior years.", "In Q1 we had a 70-basis point drag to our reported yield from these adjustments and in the second quarter, we had a headwind of about 90 basis point. My congratulations go to our pricing team and field management for overcoming these pricing headwinds. But we need to be just as diligent in the second half of the year. As I mentioned last quarter each field management team has a specific pricing plan tailored to their customer base and designed to meet their area\u2019s 2010 pricing goals.", "We remain committed to our pricing discipline and we\u2019ve designed our annual management incentive plan for the second year in a row with minimum pricing targets. Targets were set for the areas, groups and companywide. Overall those targets increased by 50 basis points in 2010. These targets must be met in order for eligible employees to receive a bonus under the 2010 annual incentive program.", "Despite the yield improvement we made in the second quarter, we still have not met our companywide pricing gate. And 2010 bonuses are still at risk. As you can imagine that has our mangers focused on utilizing all of their pricing levers to meet their pricing plans.", "So for the second half of the year we expect revenue growth from yield to continue to improve and to be in a range of 2.3% to 2.6%. The combined internal revenue growth from yield in the industrial, commercial and residential lines of our collection business was 2.7% in the second quarter. Commercial and industrial yields were 3.1% and 3.4% respectively.", "The yield component of internal revenue growth in our residential line of business was 1.8%, reflecting lower prices from CPI adjustments in the first half of the year. New business pricing for the second quarter was strongest in our commercial line of business and increased for the fourth straight quarter.", "Service increases, net of service decreases continue to improve during the second quarter of 2010, and are net positive for the second consecutive quarter. They\u2019ve been steadily improving since the second quarter of 2009. On the volume side of the business, internal revenue growth from volume declined 2.9% in the quarters, a significant improvement from the first quarter of 2010.", "This is the third quarter in a row that volume has improved compared with the prior year period. In our collection business, our commercial and residential collection line saw volume declines of 4.8% and 4% respectively. In our more economically-sensitive industrial line of business, volumes were down 5.9%, a significant improvement compared with the volume decline of 12.4% in the first quarter of this year.", "This is the first single digit volume decline in the industrial line of business since the third quarter of 2008.", "Despite the lower volumes, we continue to maintain our focus on pricing in the industrial line of business which resulted in revenue growth from yield of 3.4% for the quarter. Overall, we continue to expand our income from operation\u2019s margins in the collection line of business which increased by sixty basis points compared with the prior year period.", "In the landfill side of the business, second quarter 2010 internal revenue growth from volume moved from negative to flat, which is the best volume performance we\u2019ve seen, since the third quarter of 2008. Internal revenue growth from volume for special waste was positive 12.4% which is the second consecutive quarter of positive special waste volumes with yield for special waste being up slightly.", "For MSW, internal revenue growth from volume was negative 1.6%. Volumes continue to be the softest in our more economically sensitive C&D line which was negative by 13.7%. This is a significant improvement from the negative 25.6% volume decline in the first quarter of 2010.", "Clearly the negative volume trends in the C&D line of business are showing steady improvement since the lows reached in the fourth quarter of 2009. On the pricing front, MSW per unit landfill pricing was up by 3.1%, continuing the strong pricing we have seen in recent quarters Another sign of our pricing commitment is the second quarter per unit landfill pricing for our C&D business line which was up 4.3% despite the 13.7% decrease in volumes.", "Over the last three quarters, we have seen a steady improvement in volumes in our most economically-sensitive business lines namely landfill and industrial. We expect this trend to continue and we believe volume comparisons will continue to improve with volumes turning positive in the second half of the year.", "Increased commodity prices contributed about $0.05 of positive year-over-year earnings per diluted share in the second quarter of 2010. For the second half of 2010, we expect recycling commodity prices on average to be somewhat above second half of 2009 prices and to provide an earnings benefit of $0.01 to $0.03 per diluted share compared with the second half of 2009.", "As anticipated, second quarter electricity sales prices at our waste energy operations were slightly lower than the prior year period, causing a $3million negative impact to electricity sales revenue.", "During the second half of 2010, we anticipate electricity sales prices will be higher than the prior-year periods resulting in a benefit of $0.01 to $0.03 per diluted share which is consistent with previously issued guidance. We continue the expansion of our new Bagster business in the second quarter.", "For those of you not familiar with Bagster, it\u2019s a unique retail offering in our industry, \u201ca Dumpster in a Bag\u201d. Customers can go into a retail store and purchase a Bagster bag and then take it home and use it to dispose of remodeling and clean up debris.", "When the bag is full, our customers call us and we pick it up for disposal. We kicked up a national advertising campaign including television commercials on cable stations. We added 53 metropolitan markets for the service footprint which now includes markets in 40 states and most of Canada. ", "The number of retail locations selling the Bagster bag increased to 3200 by the end of the second quarter. Of course as in the launch of any new product, there are start up costs and we had about $0.01 of those costs in the quarter. During our Investor Day in March of this year, we said that we anticipated the economy would slowly, but steadily improve.", "The signs we saw during the second quarter are consistent with this view. And therefore we are on track to meet our full-year earnings forecast of $2.09 to $2.13 per diluted share. So in summary, we are quite pleased with our second quarter. We expect that we will continue to build upon the positive trends that we saw in the second quarter.", "Internal revenue growth from yield was up and should continue to improve in the second half of the year. Volumes should turn from a negative headwind to a positive tailwind. Electricity prices at our (inaudible) plants should show year-over-year improvement in the second half of the year and commodity prices should continue to provide benefit.", "These are all positive signs and our management team is prepared to execute to ensure that we maximize our operating leverage as the economy improves and with that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bob.", "Bob Simpson", "Thank you, David. I will begin by discussing operating costs. These costs increased by $178 million year-over-year. Cost of the goods sold increase $77 million in the quarter, mainly because of higher recycling commodity rebates related to the $129 million increase in recycling revenue. The net affect of this was $0.05 EPS benefit year-over-year in the quarter. Direct fuel costs increased approximately $29 million, primarily because of a 30% increase in fuel prices. ", "Fuel costs increased by more than fuel surcharge revenue in the quarter and caused a negative year-over-year impact to EPS of $0.01 and a negative impact of 30 basis points to our income from operations margin. Foreign currency translation for our Canadian-based operations accounted for an additional increase in operating costs of approximately $15 million, but also accounted for a revenue increase compared with the prior-year period of $22 million.", "In addition, the company had a non-cash charge of $10 million in the second quarter of 2010 and a non-cash benefit of $22 million in the second quarter of 2009 for or a year-over-year swing of $32 million associated with the accounting affect of a reduction in the 10-year Treasury rate used to discount remediation reserves.", "These accounting adjustments to our relief remediation reserves impacted our income from operations margin by 110 basis points. I would now like to just ask how we manage volatility and prices received for electricity production of our waste to energy plants. Today we sell approximately 46% of our waste to energy electricity on a merchant basis. We expect this to increase to approximately 53% by the end of 2010. The balance of our electricity is sold under long-term contracts. We currently have hedges in place in about 21% of our merchant energy stream which means our total energy portfolio is currently 64% contracted or hedged.", "The hedge is short term ranging from 60 days up to nine months. If we see an opportunity, we will lock in portions of our portfolio longer term. Overtime our goal is to move toward an energy portfolio that is 80% contracted or hedged and 20% floating. The impact of electricity sales prices at our waste to energy operations caused a year-over-year negative impact to EPS of less than $0.01 which is consistent with our previously announced guidance. As a percentage of revenue in the quarter of 2010, SG&A remained unchanged to 10.9% compared with the prior year period. SG&A costs increased by $22 million to $345 million.", "We discussed this increase in cost at our Investor Day in March and this increase results primarily from the national rollout of our advertising campaign for our new Bagster product, costs related to our growth initiatives and expenses to upgrade outdated information technology equipment and applications. For the remainder of 2010, we expect that some of the drivers of higher revenue and higher operating costs versus 2009 will remain a factor.", ".Certainly higher recycling commodity prices and higher fuel prices seem likely. We cannot predict changes to the 10-year Treasury rate, but as I discussed movements in the rate may result in adjustments to accruals for remediation. We continue to mange our reserves, our controllable expenses closely and we expect to maximize our operating leverage as volumes improve.", "As anticipated, our interest expense, net of interest income for the second quarter increased by $10 million compared with the prior-year period. This is primarily due to an increase in our average debt balance as a result of new debt issued in the fourth quarter of 2009.", "And the $600 million [4.75%] senior notes issued in June of this year. We plan to use the net proceeds from that offering to repay the $600 million (inaudible) senior notes that will mature in August of this year. On June 30, our weighted average cost of debt was 5.23%.", "Our debt-to-total capital ratio for the quarter was 59.9% in line with our target ratio of about 60%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 18% at the end of the quarter. In June, we replaced our $2.4 billion revolving credit facility for a new three year $2 billion revolver.", "Over the past few months, we also added $250 million of additional letter of credit capacity in a separate facility. Our $2.4 billion revolver would have gone current next month and given that a substantial portion of the facility for letters of credit we needed to replace it before that. ", "As we previously mentioned, the cost of the revolving credit has increased substantially in the past two years. As a result, our interest costs will increase by about $7.5 million per quarter beginning in the third quarter. And our weighted average cost of debt will be about 5.6%. We communicated this type of increase when we gave guidance at the beginning of the year and we want to remind you of that increased cost.", "Our income tax rate for the second quarter of 2010 was 44.2% reflecting big changes in our estimated differed state taxes. Excluding this impact, our tax rate for the second quarter was 36.2%. Turning to cash flow in the second quarter, net cash provided by operating activities was $418 million, a decrease of $68 million compared with the second quarter of 2009. This decrease is due mainly to the working capital of effect of an increase in accounts receivables as our revenue increased this year.", "Our day sales outstanding improved by 1.3 days and our bad debt expense decreased slightly. We continue to manage all of our receivables very closely. Our capital expenditure for the quarter were about $220 million, a decreased of $38 million compared with the prior-year period.", "Our free cash flow for the quarter was $275 million. We continue to be on track to meet our previously discussed full-year 2010 guidance of approximately $1.2 billion for capital expenditures, in a range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of free cash flow. In the second quarter of 2010, we paid $152 million in dividends and we repurchased $166 million of our common stock.", "Our dividend yield is currently 3.7%. We are pleased with the results of the second quarter and recognize that the results are due to the effort and dedication of each of our fellow employees. We are grateful for their fine work and with that Tia, let\u2019s open the lines for questions.", "Operator", "", "[Operator Instructions]", "", "The first question will come from Scott Levine with JPMorgan.", "Scott Levine - JPMorgan", "So the pricing accelerated nicely in the quarter and sequentially and you\u2019d indicated I think in the last call that you are anticipating a hike in the environmental fee of about 150 basis points. Can you talk maybe to some of the other drivers of acceleration in the face of what looks like increased headwinds from inflation and then also if you can provide a sense from a secular standpoint maybe of how you are tracking relative to your gates and whether your guidance for the second half implies that you\u2019ll meet those gates with some room for comfort there?", "David Steiner", "Yes, certainly Scott as we said we expect the program to pick up in the back half of the year. We are actually very close to the gate right now and so our plans absolutely have us exceeding the gate in the back half of the year. When we look at the drivers, you hit the nail right on the head that the environmental fee was certainly a big driver contributing about $14 million sequentially from the first quarter, but with our pricing programs always the primary driver is going to be price increases and we\u2019ve certainly accelerated those during the first quarter and the second quarter. Most of those hits even though we put them in the first quarter, they didn\u2019t hit until the second quarter and so we saw a very aggressive pricing action on our commercial and industrial lines of business.", "Scott Levine - JPMorgan", "", "And then on the margins, I think a prior guidance was that you would see EBIT margins expand this year. Is it still your expectation or does this change with the environmental viability accounting assumption affect that in anyway, what are your thoughts on margins?", "David Steiner", "Our margins will expand this year. One thing to focus on is that half of the financial component of our annual incentive performance plan requires margin expansion. And so we will we think continue to expand margins as the year goes on what we expect will be last year.", "Bob Simpson", "Scott, when we look at margins, certainly the 10-year Treasury going down is something that is out of our control. So when we look at margins, frankly we normalize for that whether it\u2019s positive or negative. We\u2019ve had times when it\u2019s gone the other way. And we normalize to take that out.", "Scott Levine - JPMorgan", "Okay, so in thinking about modeling even in margins, we should be excluding that headwind for Q2.", "Bob Simpson", "Yes.", "Scott Levine - JPMorgan", "Okay one last and really quickly, any change on the guidance for the tax rates for the full year.", "Bob Simpson", "In April we invested in a low-income housing tax credit partnership that has a return of about 30%. So, it\u2019s a very good investment for us and it\u2019s one of those investments where there is a little bit of money upfront, but then every further payment you make is actually less than the tax credit you will get.", "And going forward, this investment will result in a loss of $6 million to $8 million every quarter that will go through other income or loss. So you saw that in this quarter, you will see that going forward. Now the tax credits resulting from this investment will reduce our effective tax rate to 36.7%. So you need to show both sides. You need to pick the $6 million to $8 million loss in other income or loss and then you then you need to show the effective tax rate of at 36.7% and we expect this investment will give us an earnings per share benefit in the future of $0.01 to $0.02 every year.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Hamzah Mazari with Credit Suisse.", "Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse", "Could you may be just touch on the cost side of your business and how investors should think about, you spend on growth initiatives. You talked about that in your release, in your comments. Particularly, how we should think about that going forward and then as you look out towards your pipeline on waste to energy deals and the medical side, what can we expect, how does the acquisition landscape look like, if you can touch on some of those topics.", "David Steiner", "Sure, when you look at the cost side of growth, in the first and second quarter we saw about $0.01 to $0.02 of expenses from those initiative. We would expect that to continue in the short term, but then to turn neutral and obviously ultimately turn positive. So those are expenses that we are glad to put out because they going to lead to growth in the future.", "As far as medical waste and waste to energy, primarily we made an acquisition as you know for $150 million in the waste to energy space. We made some smaller acquisitions in the medical waste space. We don\u2019t see any large expenditures for acquisition in either of those areas going forward. Mostly we will be doing Greenfield size on the medical waste side and then we will be winning bids on the waste to energy side and with the waste to energy fees, after you win a bid, you still got three to five years before you are under construction because of permitting and things like that. ", "Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse", "You talked about incrementally positive volume trends and you\u2019ve also flagged out your incremental EBITDA margins maybe close to 50% on volume coming back. First question, are you beginning to see some of that incremental margin pullthrough in your numbers right now or is that just too early for you guys and number two, are you seeing acceleration in special waste and industrial early in Q3 that you have seen at Q2?", "David Steiner", "Yes, from the incremental margin point of view we haven\u2019t seen the full effect of it because we are still having negative volumes right. As we start to see volumes turn positive, that\u2019s when you\u2019ll see the full effect of the leverage that you discussed. On the special waste side, the pipeline still looks fairly robust.", "As you know, we\u2019ve got two consecutive quarters with positive special waste. We would expect that to be positive in the third quarter. It\u2019s going to be difficult to continue to get that 8% to 12% type of growth, but we certainly expect it to be positive in the third quarter.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Jonathan Ellis with Bank of America.", "Jonathan Ellis - Bank of America", "I want to make sure I am clear about the pricing guidance that you have given for the year. Based on the first half results and then I think David said 2.3% to 2.6% in the second half, I am just wondering, try to understand how that gets you to the low end of the 2.5% to 3% range that you\u2019ve previously provided, just help us understand sort of the map there or the bridge.", "David Steiner", "Yes, Jonathan basically what we are saying that it\u2019s going to be very difficult to get even to the low end of that 2.5% to 3.3% price range because, both the negative effect that we had in the first half of the year, but we are also seeing a little bit more of a headwind in the back of the year from CPI.", "As you saw CPI spiked in December and then it started to go down culminating in June in a 1.1% CPI. We had expected it to stay above 2% in the first half of year, so that we would get a little bit of tailwind going into the back half of year. So in the first half of the year, we had 70 basis points of headwinds in Q1. We had 90 basis points in Q2, we expect to have a similar sort of 70 to 90 basis point headwind in Q3. It starts to abate in Q4. So given that we aren\u2019t going to get as much from CPI in the back half of the year, we dropped that overall guidance to 2.3% to 2.6% for the back of the year.", "Obviously when you average those out, you can tell it is going to be difficult to get to that 2.5% target that we set.", "Jonathan Ellis - Bank of America", "Second question, just on your earnings guidance for the year, you told 209 to 213, consistent what you have said in the past, but obviously recycling and if I do the math on the benefit in the first and second quarters and then what you said about recycling for the second half of the year. My math suggests it is going to be 12% to 14%, $0.12 to $0.14 EPS benefit for the year.", "I think previously you guided $0.04 to $0.08 for the year. So can you just help us understand what, perhaps some of the offsets are, to the boost in recycling in terms of the EPS guidance for the year?", "Bob Simpson", "Sure, we just talked about one of them and this the effect on yield of the lower CPI and then secondly as we talked about before, the $0.01 to $0.02 that we are spending on growth initiatives certainly is a headwind. So that pretty much offsets the benefit from recycling. And then you saw in the last couple of the quarters we haven\u2019t been recovering all of our fuel costs with our fuel surcharge. That should continue for the back half of the year. So we\u2019ve got a couple of headwinds that basically offset that recycling gain.", "Jonathan Ellis - Bank of America", "One question about on the landfill side, I want to ask about, any material benefit this quarter from -- I know you have a contract in the Gulf Coast for disposal of oily sand. Were there any material contribution this quarter, anything you are anticipating in third quarter?", "David Steiner", "Yes, it\u2019s interesting that you mentioned that Jon, I think because as we\u2019ve looked at that from the event in the Gulf, what we found is that we are into a less than half of the revenue that we\u2019re getting is actually coming from collection of disposal. That\u2019s because we went in and said we were going to provide a comprehensive environmental solution, so when we went in, if we had gone in just on collection and disposal, we wouldn\u2019t be getting much revenue out of it because there\u2019s not a lot of waste being generated.", "But we went in with a lot of different solutions, both for solid waste and for liquid waste and so we saw about $20 million of revenue during the quarter at about sort of company average type margins and we\u2019d expect that to be higher in the third quarter, but as you know with the capping of the well, you know it\u2019s not clear how long that will continue. ", "Jonathan Ellis - Bank of America", "Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Just two more quick questions if I may, one on the medical waste side. Any updates on some of the pilot projects you doing with hospitals, to sort of universal waste management within the hospitals. How does that seem to be [resonating] and also any update in terms of the leadership within that division, any other changes that have taken place since the departure of the previous head of that group?", "David Steiner", "Yes, we have actually seen some very good traction on the medical waste side. We just had a very large hospital chain that we did a pilot for here in Houston and they\u2019ve just added six additional hospitals to add to the number and hopefully at some point in time we\u2019ll continue to add to that.", "From a leadership point of view, we wanted to make sure that our medical waste offering integrated with our solid waste offering and so we put one of our former market area general managers in charge of that business segment. Other than that, there haven\u2019t been any changes in leadership, but the good news about medical waste is that we talked about it from a growth initiative point of view, the $0.01 to $0.02 that we are spending on growth initiatives, certainly medical waste would be one of those and we\u2019re getting close to be and fully staffed from a sales point of view.", "Obviously, when you are stepping up that cost to your money. Once you got that full staff in place and they start making sales is when it turns from a negative headwind to a positive tailwind, we\u2019d expect to see that happen in the back half of the year.", "Jonathan Ellis - Bank of America", "My final question on the guidance for cash flow. If my math is correct, it looks like you slightly revised your cash flow from operations guidance down I think $25 million to $50 million in terms of the range. The first part of the question is does your guidance now include the legal settlement and the second part is what can be attributed to the downward revision?", "Bob Simpson", "It was just a review to the second question. The answer to your first question is yes it does include that and second, the downward revision is just updating from the standpoint of looking at where we are at this point in the year. It\u2019s not a significant change.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley.", "Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley", "First just one more question on the volumes, David in your prepared remarks you mentioned overall volume comparisons turning positive during the second half, I think is the way you phrased it which could be turn positive late in the quarter. So I just want to clarify, do you expect overall positive volume comparisons for the second half as a whole?", "David Steiner", "Absolutely.", "Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley", "With all the focus on pricing, can you describe how that\u2019s translating in the customer retention rates? Is it competitive enough out there that you are seeing some customers walk upon facing higher rates?", "David Steiner", "Yes and again we got very aggressive on price increases. We knew we had to get aggressive on price increases to overcome the effect of the CPI headwind. And that caused an increase in our churn rate, not a substantial increase, but our churn rate did hit 11% in the quarter. ", "And so that trade off has always been very positive for us. It continues to be very positive for us and so we did see a slight uptick in churn rate. We are seeing a little bit more of action by competitors around municipal contracts and school contracts and things like that. But overall we see the pricing environment very positively.", "Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley", "Okay so, municipal budget constraints you say are affecting the negotiations of bid, is that mainly price concessions or is it reduced services being agreed upon, any color you can provide there?", "David Steiner", "Yes, for us it is mostly a reduced service. Again the numbers aren\u2019t real, but I will use it as an example. And that is if we have a municipality that we\u2019d pick up twice $50 per pick up from a cost point of view, that cost us a $100. If can we go into them and say look, we can pick up once instead of twice and we can reduce it by $30 to $40. We make more money, they save some money it\u2019s a win, win situation, so that\u2019s been the approach that we\u2019re primarily taking with our municipal customers.", "Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley", "Any feel for whether we will see additional increases to environmental remediation reserves, should we consider that, essentially an ongoing charge or is it one-off, would you say?", "Bob Simpson", "It really depends on the issue and how far each specific issue is, we do I think a very good job of keeping track of that and adjusting as the defects develop, but I don\u2019t see any specific trend here just yet.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Corey Greendale with First Analysis.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "First of all also on the volumes, could you just speak to volume trends within the quarter and into July and David not to pin you down too much, but if you had to give an over under on what months by in which you positive. You think it sometime in Q3 or what would you say?", "David Steiner", "I think, gambling is illegal United States, Corey. So I am not sure if I can give an over under, but what we did see. As you can imagine, we saw the volumes track up fairly consistently through the quarter. In June, we actually had when you look at the combined price and volume, in June we actually had positive IRG in both the landfill and the collection line of business and so when I look at it Corey, I like to look at it from a total IRG point of view.", "That\u2019s the first time, we\u2019ve seen positive IRG in probably two years and so when the volumes turn positive, I think it\u2019s probably anyone\u2019s call, but the IRG did positive in June. We hope to see that continue.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "The comment you made about seeing maybe smaller competitors, I don\u2019t know if you meant to fairly smaller, but generally competitors are getting more aggressive in some municipal contracts. I had two questions about that. First of all, why do you think that is happening now because obviously the economy has been back for a while and it seems like (inaudible) is actually getting a little bit better and secondly could you just remind us of what your process is for bidding municipal contracts, how much that\u2019s done at the local level? And how much either regional or central oversight there is over that?", "David Steiner", "Yes, you know it\u2019s a great question it used to be done completely locally and when we moved to a segment in our customer base, we actually put a gentleman by the name of Paul Pistono in charge of municipal contracts, to look at them more from a regional and a national point of view and so again Corey, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a dramatic change. In other words as far it\u2019s both municipal contracts and school contracts. We\u2019ve seen some increased competition, not enough to identify a trend.", "So I don\u2019t think that what you are seeing is people reacting to the economy, I think it\u2019s more just a one off and we are seeing that from local competitors as well as regional and national competitors. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s creating a trend. I think those are just one-off examples and so when we look at the municipal business, we want to make sure that we do look at it now from a more centralized point of view and that we are making smart business decisions. There is always going to be a trade-off, when you are looking at new business versus routine business. Sometime with routine business you can keep current capital in place, so you have a much better return on capital and as you know we are focused on return on capital.", "But from a bidding point of view, we want to make sure that we are getting all of the services into the RFPs that we are able to offer, so that we can provide a city a comprehensive environmental solution. So we will certainly look at it from a more centralized basis, what you are seeing I think from a competitive point of view are sort of one-off localized decisions.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "And just one last quick housekeeping question of I could for Bob. On the tax investment that you mentioned, would you suggest modeling 36 by 7% of the tax rate for each quarter or is that an annual and is there a finite duration so this ends at some point.", "Bob Simpson", "This investment will run eight to 10 years, so it is going to go a long time 36/7 will be good for the rest of the year for each quarter for the rest of the year.", "Operator", "The question will come from Bill Fisher with Raymond James.", "Bill Fisher - Raymond James", "The other revenue was up like $20 million to $76 million in the quarter and you mentioned the Bagster I think $20 million of liquid waste and you get medical waste. Are they all in that line item or could help me just walk through some of that.", "Bob Simpson", "Some of it is, there in there a little bit, some of the special waste projects we\u2019ve got end up in that particular line. So, that\u2019s mostly what that is.", "Bill Fisher - Raymond James", "But to the extent all that stuff continues to improve and that should help and show up there essentially?", "Bob Simpson", "Yes.", "Bill Fisher - Raymond James", "Just another small and this is Bob, the Chinese to joint venture that kind of closed, is that correct or.", "Bob Simpson", "Yes, it is.", "Bill Fisher - Raymond James", "And that to the extent it shows up as equity income, it would be just be down in that other as well?", "Bob Simpson", "Correct.", "Bill Fisher - Raymond James", "Okay and then I think you said you had some lower expectations this year, but with that (inaudible), that\u2019s more of an 2011 kind of benefit from a operating perspective?", "Bob Simpson", "Yes, that\u2019s right. We expect there will be some small benefit from the Chinese venture this year, less than $5 million, but as they started up because some of the investments we are making and then putting in place the infrastructure.", "Going forward, we expect that they have a much more significant benefit. Since it\u2019s going to take a little longer than to turn significantly positive as we get in and do the startup things we have to do to get that plan up to specs.", "We hope to get a little bit of benefit from that this year, but it was very small. I think we will probably have just a little bit of a negative there, but again it won\u2019t enough to move the needle.", "Operator", "", "The next question will come from Richard Skidmore with Goldman Sachs.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs", "", "David could you just maybe talk about the strategy that you outlined at your investor day with regards to the more focused salesforce in the key verticals and how you see that accelerating in terms of revenue growth here in the second half of 2010 or 2011 and any success stories you can articulate.", "David Steiner", "", "Yes, it\u2019s a great question Rick and we took our sales force and put it into six separate segments and we\u2019re certainly seeing anecdotal successes there, we talked about the Gulf Coast incident. That\u2019s one where we had specialist that were dedicated just to that, you\u2019ve heard us talk about are stepping in the coal ash and we\u2019ve dedicated a team to that.", "Medical waste, you\u2019ve heard us talk about the value proposition that we can provide to the customers. And then on our manufacturing and industrial segment, we\u2019ve seen some great successes, we just won the second largest refinery in the United States because we went in and provided a comprehensive environmental solution to them.", "And so we\u2019re certainly seeing that gain some traction. We haven\u2019t even tried Rick quite frankly to put numbers to it because we are just finishing, we literally just finished moving our sales folks into the proper segments. We\u2019ve begun the training of those folks in those segments, and so we haven\u2019t tried to put a dollar amount to that, quite yet.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs", "", "Okay David did you see the more in 2011, that it really starts to accelerate in terms of having a meaningful impact on revenue or is it something that\u2019s even longer than that.", "David Steiner", "", "No, I think you\u2019ll start to see it in kicking in 2011.", "Operator", "", "The final question will come from Michael Hoffman with Wunderlich Securities.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "", "Can we drill down a little bit on the free cash flow guidance $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, need a fairly substantial improvement in your cash from ops in the second half which should we start disaggregating the pieces, looks like positive volumes drives operating leverage. Kind of need to get a 100 basis points margin improvement for that and then you need a pretty big working capital improvement?", "David Steiner", "Yes I think that\u2019s right Michael. I think you\u2019ve got it. I think you hit the nail right on the head. The one thing to recognize is that the year is playing more like 2007 and 2008 than it is like 2009. So we typically see a working capital benefit coming through cash from ops in the second half of the year as receivables from seasonality that drive up like we saw this year start getting collected. So I do think that\u2019s what we are expecting to see.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "Okay, and you expect to still spend a $1.2 billion on it?", "David Steiner", "That\u2019s right we do and we have to tell that number changes every year as we get into how much gets accrued at the end of the year versus actually paid versus what was period over from the prior year, but the actual spending of $1.2 billion, how much runthrough free cash flow might adjust a little bit from that?", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "And that\u2019s kind of a $50 million kind of a swing number usually?", "Bob Simpson", "From the figures in that last year, but this year I expect it to be in the normal 40 to 60 ranks or 50 is a good number", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "And then digging a little bit on that margin issue and not going for the bet on which months, David, but can you talk about the categories, do I need MSW to go neutral to get this deposit or do I need the C&D? What\u2019s the category that you are most focused on that needs to make that switch to have the two second half tend to be positive.", "David Steiner", "Yes, Michael I would look at the cyclical lines of business right. I\u2019d look at the industrial and the C&D. Now we certainly don\u2019t expect C&D to go from negative 13% to positive but that\u2019s going to be offset by special ways in the landfill side. And so when you look it frankly, it comes down to rolloff poles and once we see rolloff poles going positive, that means you are coming out of that cyclical downturn and everything else follow suit.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "So, to your comment about positive IRG in June, one would read into that, is it why you were down 13%, for the whole quarter, you were significantly less than that in June?", "David Steiner", "Well what I am talking about, Michael is the overall collection and overall landfill so you have got basically special ways offsetting the negatives in C&D, so it wasn\u2019t that all the lines went positive. It\u2019s that within the business lines, within landfill, when you combine them and the business lines within collection when you combine them had positive IRG.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "The coal ash issue, we\u2019ve got a (inaudible) out there from EPA, they are pushing this to be a subtitle C, where do you think that ends up?", "David Steiner", "Yeah, we certainly think it ends up subtitle D, as you know the current regulations do have a subtitle C, those regulations are in comment period right and from what we understand the overwhelming majority of comments are that it should go into subtitle D landfills and so we are going to add our voice to that and hopefully we will see those final regulations by the end of the year.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "And then two income statement items Bob, just so I am clear on, you gave that $7.5 million number on interest expense, what number do you expect interest expense to look like compared to the $116 million in 3Q and 4Q.", "Bob Simpson", "Let me just get you some more on that we got, I think we are expecting it to be 127, 125 in those two quarters.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "G&A, did I hear correctly, you expect a 10.9 as a percent of revenue that trend holds.", "Bob Simpson", "What I expect Michael is that the percentage that we had last year will carry forward and I think you will see spending come down a bit in the third and the fourth quarter, but I think as a percent of revenue, it will be pretty much the same as last year. That\u2019s just for the investments we are making now. My personal goal is to get it down to 9% in two years out.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "And we are 6 months into that?", "Bob Simpson", "Actually no, that was - we are actually six months into my three year goal, so that is out but the clock is ticking.", "Operator", "At this time I would turn the conference back over to Mr. Steiner for any closing remarks.", "David Steiner", "Thank you. As you can see, from our second quarter results, the strategy continues to work and we look forward to giving you more on our strategy, as we get out on the road during the rest of the year. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, for participating in today\u2019s second quarter 2010 earnings conference call.

Thank you, Mr. Alderson, you may begin your conference.", "Jim Alderson", "Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us for our third quarter of 2010 earnings conference call. With me this morning are David Steiner, Chief Executive Officer and Bob Simpson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. David will start things off with a summary of the financial results for the quarter and a review of the details of our revenue growth, including price and volume trends.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of Waste Management is prohibited.", "Now I will turn the call over to Waste Management's CEO, David Steiner.", "David Steiner", "Thanks, Jim. Good morning from Houston. We earned $0.55 per share in the third quarter, with our collection, landfill and recycling businesses all performing very solidly. We increased operating earnings and improved operating margins in each of these lines of business.", "If we didn't have headwinds from areas not related to those lines of business, we would have earned $0.60 per diluted share, in line with our expectations. The headwinds come from unexpected expenses at certain of our waste energy facilities that cost us $0.02 per diluted share in the quarter and start-up costs from certain of our growth initiatives, which cost approximately $0.03 per diluted share in the quarter. The expenses of our waste-to-energy facilities primarily relate to unexpected maintenance costs, including costs to upgrade the SIPSA facility that we recently acquired. The start-up costs for our growth initiatives include our Bagster retail product and our initiatives in medical waste.", "We had a lot of start-up advertising and other expenses related to Bagster and the advertising is working. In April, when we started our advertising campaign, we picked up 3,800 Bags. In October, we picked up 13,000. That's a 22% per month compounded growth rate and we expect to continue to see high growth rates in the future. We have now sold over 100,000 Bags. So we expect Bagster to become profitable over the next 12 months.", "With respect to our medical waste initiatives, most of the additional costs relate to hiring new sales people and getting new facilities in place. Because the sales cycle in medical waste is longer than in traditional solid waste, getting to profitability takes some time. But we expect our medical waste initiatives to become profitable in the second half of 2011.", "We are seeing some wins in our medical waste business and we expect this to accelerate, but we expected revenue to grow faster through acquisitions. However, we do have a competitor that continues to purchase businesses at prices that we aren't willing to pay, which has hindered our efforts to enter certain strategic markets. So overall, our growth has been slower than we expected, but we still believe these customer-focused growth initiatives are the right thing to do for the long-term growth of our company.", "So we had some headwinds in our growth initiatives, but they're not the bulk of our business. Our business is still centered around our collection, disposal and recycling assets and these areas of the business are doing very well, driven by these lines of business, revenue for the third quarter increased by $212 million. It was the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. Major drivers of our revenue growth were improved recycling commodity prices, acquisitions and increases in revenue growth from yield.", "Internal revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal operations was 2.3% in the third quarter. We remain committed to our pricing discipline and in the third quarter we again overcame the yield headwind we faced on the 40% of our collection revenue that has price adjustment based on a CPI index. CPI adjustments caused a drag to our revenue growth from yield of approximately 60 basis points. Despite this headwind, we met our pricing objective to achieve price increases of at least 50 to 100 basis points above CPI.", "The combined internal revenue growth from yield in the industrial, commercial and residential lines of our collection business was 2.5% in the third quarter. Internal revenue growth from yield in our commercial and industrial lines was 2.9% and 3.2% respectively, while internal revenue growth from yield in our residential line of business was 1.5%, reflecting the continuation of the low CPI environment.", "Commercial new business pricing increased for the fourth consecutive quarter. And service increases exceeded service decreases for the third consecutive quarter.", "On the volume side of the business, internal revenue growth from volume in our collection and disposal business declined by 0.8% in the quarter. This is the fourth quarter in a row that the year-over-year comparison has improved. Internal revenue growth from volume in our commercial and residential collection lines saw declines of 4.7% and 4% respectively.", "In our industrial line of business, internal revenue growth from volume was down 3.1%, which is a marked improvement from the last 2.5 years. So, as I said before, our traditional solid waste business continues to perform well. Overall, we grew income from operations in the collection line of business and increased the income from operations margin by 60 basis points, compared with the prior year period.", "In the land fill side of the business, third quarter 2010 internal revenue growth from volume was positive 3.6%, which is up from flat volume in the second quarter of 2010. This is the best internal revenue growth from volume performance in the landfill business since 2006. Internal revenue growth from volume for special waste was positive 16.4%.", "For MSW, internal revenue growth from volume was negative 5.3%. In our C&D line, internal revenue growth from volume was negative by 6.5%, a significant improvement from negative 13.7% in the second quarter of 2010. Volume comparisons have consistently improved in our C&D line since the fourth quarter of 2009.", "On the land fill pricing front, MSW per-unit pricing was up by 3%, reflecting our continued focus on landfill pricing. We expect this to accelerate as we move into 2011. So, our landfill business also performed well in the quarter. Overall, we grew income from operations in the landfill line of business and increased the income from operations margin by 100 basis points, compared with the prior year period. When we look at our collection and land fill business combined, income from operations grew over 6% compared with the third quarter of 2009 and our income from operations margin improved by 70 basis points.", "Turning to our recycling business, increased commodity prices contributed about $0.02 of positive year-over-year earnings per diluted share in the third quarter of 2010. For the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect recycling commodity prices to remain strong, which should provide a slight benefit to earnings. We received no benefit from electricity sales in the quarter and we anticipate that fourth quarter 2010 electricity prices will be about the same as in the prior year. Therefore, we do not expect electricity prices to impact earnings in the fourth quarter of 2010.", "So, looking at price and volume going forward, volumes were slightly lower than we expected in the third quarter, but they held up fine. And we expect them to improve and turn slightly positive in the fourth quarter. I'd certainly like to see volumes driven more by the commercial and MSW lines of business, because I think that would demonstrate a more robust economy and it would accelerate the pace of volume growth. But we still see slow but steady improvement in volumes in the fourth quarter.", "With respect to price, we expect CPI headwinds to continue and we will have to offset those with aggressive pricing programs. We did so in the third quarter and we will continue to do so in the fourth quarter. Consequently, we expect price to be about 2.3% in fourth quarter.", "When we look ahead to our earnings in the fourth quarter, we remain committed to our pricing discipline and we expect that recycling commodity prices will remain strong. We believe collection and disposal volumes will continue to improve, driven mainly by continued strength in special waste.", "We are also redoubling our cost control efforts and expect to see improvement in our cost structure in the fourth quarter. Given these factors, we expect the core business to continue to improve. We'll still face some headwinds from start-up costs associated with our customer focused growth initiatives, but with our continued efforts to increase revenues in our Bagster and medical waste businesses, the impact should be slightly lessened.", "Consequently, we expect our fully diluted adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2010 to be between $0.54 and $0.56 per share. And we continue to expect full year 2010 free cash flow in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. We're committed to our long-term goals of expanding margins, increasing free cash flow and improving our return on invested capital and we believe the investments we've made in our customer focus growth initiatives will help us achieve these goals.", "And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.", "Bob Simpson", "Thank you, David. I will begin by discussing operating costs. These costs increased in the third quarter of 2010 by $131 million. Cost of goods sold increased $67 million in the quarter, mainly because of higher recycling commodity rebates. On a net basis, earnings per diluted share increased approximately $0.02 in the quarter from higher recycling commodity prices. Subcontractor costs increased $37 million in the quarter, primarily the result of costs associated with the clean-up effort in the Gulf Coast region. Maintenance costs increased $18 million, primarily at our Wheelabrator waste-to-energy operations.", "Direct fuel costs increased approximately $12 million, primarily because of a 13% increase in diesel fuel prices. Fuel costs increased by more than our fuel surcharge revenue in the quarter, which caused a negative $4 million impact to income from operations and a negative 20 basis point impact on our income from operations margin. We are adjusting our fuel surcharge to do a better job of recovering increasing fuel prices, so at current prices we do not expect a negative earnings impact from fuel in the fourth quarter.", "Foreign currency translation for our Canadian operations accounted for an increase in operating costs of approximately $7 million. SG&A costs were $369 million in the third quarter, an increase of $30 million from the third quarter of last year. As a percent of revenue, SG&A costs were 11.4%. These costs increased primarily because of our growth initiatives and expenses to upgrade outdated IT equipment and applications. Although we expect to continue to spend to support our growth in IT initiatives, we have implemented several cost control measures to reduce costs.", "As anticipated, our interest expense for the third quarter increased by $22 million, compared with the prior year period. This is primarily due to an increase in our average debt balance and the increased cost of the new revolving credit facility that we executed in June. The average debt balance increased due to new debt issued in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the $600 million of 4.75 senior notes issued in June of this year.", "Now, we used the net proceed from the June offering to repay the $600 million 7.375 senior notes that matured in August of this year. Additionally in June, we replaced our $2.4 billion revolving credit facility with a new three year $2 billion revolver. We also added $250 million of additional letter of credit capacity in a separate facility. The cost of revolving credit has increased substantially in the past two years. As a result, our interest costs increased by about $7 million per quarter beginning in the third quarter for the revolver and letter of credit facilities.", "On September 30, our weighted average cost of debt was 5.4% and our debt-to-total-capital ratio for the quarter was 58.2%, consistent with our target ratio of about 60%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 13% at the end of the quarter.", "Our income tax rate for the third quarter was 37.3%. After adjusting for the $4 million of income tax expense referenced in our press release, our tax rate for the third quarter was 36.3%.", "Turning to cash flow, third quarter 2010 net cash provided by operating activities was $677 million, an increase of $102 million compared with the third quarter of 2009. During the third quarter, we received a federal tax refund of $65 million related to a capital loss from the liquidation of an inactive foreign subsidiary. The remainder of the increase is due mainly to improved cash provided by operating activities.", "Over the past two years, we have managed our receivables very closely and our days sales outstanding have improved throughout the period. In the third quarter, our days sales outstanding improved by 1.3 days. We thank all of our employees who have stayed focused on managing our receivables during this downturn.", "In the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect a $60 million reduction in our federal income tax payment due to bonus depreciation included in recent tax legislation. This will have no effect on our reported income tax expense.", "Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $262 million, which is an increase of $22 million compared with the prior year period. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $424 million and was $952 million for the first nine months of 2010.", "In the third quarter of 2010, we paid $149 million in dividends and we repurchased $157 million of our common stock. We remain firmly on track to meet our previously disclosed full-year 2010 guidance of spending approximately $1.2 billion for capital expenditures and having a range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of free cash flow.", "And with that, Nicole, let's open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Credit Suisse.", "David Steiner", "Good morning, Hamzah.", "Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Good morning. Thank you. First question, you talked about landfill pricing and the pace of acceleration. How should we think about that base of acceleration going forward? Is it a gradual ramp? And how comfortable do you feel raising prices, given the volume situation right now and just the price volume trade-off that you think about in your system?", "David Steiner", "It is a great question. And I have said many times, that when you've got volumes going down fairly dramatically in landfill, you are not going be as aggressive on pricing. Now that we have seen the volumes turn, we are putting together our plans for our 2011 pricing program and we expect that 3% yield to go up. Now, at our landfills, obviously you've got a lot of volume that's contracted, so you can't hit everything in year one. But what we are doing right now, is going through every single MSW customer that we have at our landfills and we're looking at what we're going to do next year. And that's going to accelerate the pricing into 2011.", "Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. And then, just a second question. Could you just help us understand how focused you are on your underlying business? The expectations on the medical, as well as waste to energy side. Are these more one-time issues? And how should we think about that going forward? It seems like on waste-to-energy it was.", "David Steiner", "Yeah. Certainly, on the waste-to-energy side. But we will have some more maintenance expenses to get that SIPSA plan up to speed, but it won't be as dramatic as it was this quarter. On the medical waste side, it is interesting. When we add new business on the solid waste side, it lays right in on top of our current asset structure. Obviously on the medical waste side, you have to add new sales people, because you have to have more of a specialized sales person.", "And so you can't use your existing infrastructure to service those customers. So we had to add facilities. We had to add sales people. And so, like any start up business, you are going to have start up costs. But we really are starting to see our value proposition take hold. We completely expect to see that business double in the next year and that will put us well on our way to hitting our goal of growing that business to $300 million over the next three or four years.", "Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. Then just last question and I will turn it over. Are you guys beginning the see the incremental margin to pull through yet? Or is it too early?", "Bob Simpson", "Hamzah, the area where we've had positive margins this time was in the landfill. You may remember it at Investor Day, we talked about landfill margin, the incremental margin at the land fill being 45% to 50%, well, lesser to base on what we saw this quarter, it was at least that. And so I think that 45% to 50% number really does hold true. At least it has so far.", "Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Levine with J.P. Morgan.", "Bob Simpson", "Good Morning, Scott.", "Scott Levine \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Good morning. Good morning, guys. Question on the investments in the growth initiatives. Without asking for guidance for next year, is your expectation regarding most of the initiatives that you highlighted at the investor day, sales floor segmentation, Medical Waste, what have you, IT? What are your preliminary expectations in terms of those investments next year versus this year? Without asking for a number, do you expect most of those types of investments to be completed this year? Do you expect some carryover into 2011 that could be meaningful?", "David Steiner", "Yeah. I wouldn't say that we've had a carry-over that would be dramatically meaningful, but we're certainly going to continue to invest in those areas where we need to invest, in order to continue to focus on our customers and see the growth that we expect. So, IT systems are certainly a part of that and we will spend on that next year. Obviously, we\u2019ll give you some specific guidance when we look at our full-year budget and report fourth quarter earnings.", "Customer focused growth, the segmentation efforts that we've had, we've pretty much spent the money that we're going to spend on that. We've hired the additional people. We've done most of the additional training, so there shouldn't be significant expenditures on that side. And then on the various growth initiatives that we've talked about with Bagster and Medical Waste, you will continue to see spending on that. Look, the issue here, on both Bagster and Medical Waste, is that you have to spend that money up front, in order to get the customers to get the revenue to offset the costs. And we expect to see both of those turn positive in the second half of 2011.", "Scott Levine \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Got it. And then turning to your guidance. So, just putting the numbers in preliminarily for the fourth quarter, it looks like on a full-year basis, you guide your margins down flat, to maybe down very slightly for 2010. I think you'd indicated that margins being up, I think on the EBIT line, was kind of factored into a portion of your incentive program. Is it still the case? Is your expectation \u2013 what is your expectation on margins on a full year basis in 2010? I guess is the question.", "Bob Simpson", "I am expecting the margins to be flat to up just a little bit.", "Scott Levine \u2013 J.P Morgan", "Okay.", "Bob Simpson", "So \u2013 and I am not anticipating that we will not hit that target. We have taken some cost control measures, which Dave referred to in his remarks and I did as well, to make sure that we bring our SG&A and some of our operating costs down to a level that, in the fourth quarter, will be about what we spent last year. Remember, we spent over $30 million higher in SG&A this quarter than last year. We expect to be flat to last year in the fourth quarter. And I think that will help us get to the margin number.", "Scott Levine \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Thanks, Bob. And maybe one other quick one. The economic data generally adheres, progresses, kind of pointed towards gradual recovery. You are still expecting volumes to be up slightly in the fourth quarter. Could you comment on how the cyclical aspect your business, in general, has performed relative to your expectation, say, six months ago? And whether there's anything you need to comment on, regarding any particular part of the country or another, whether any are particularly weak or strong in your view?", "David Steiner", "Yeah. It is really a great question. We look at that quite a bit. And so we look at it, it is a little bit of what we said in our prepared remarks which is, we would love to see the volumes bounce back more in our commercial line of business and MSW. Because that's really the lines of business that we have, that tell us that the economy is growing at a steady pace. But right now, we are seeing at the landfill it's being driven by special waste. Now, the good news with us on special waste, is that with our focus on the customers and trying to find out what our large industrial customers want, we're seeing more of that special waste become more permanent-type special waste, than episodic special waste.", "So, as you look at the economy going forward, for us, we think you'll see a turn in the economy, when you start to see the commercial volumes bounce back. They've basically been in that negative 3.5% to 5% range now, for a couple of years. And I think that tells you exactly what you started out with which is that we've got a muted economic recovery. But it's enough economic recovery for us to continue to grow our business. And we don't see that changing dramatically over the next two or three quarters.", "Scott Levine \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Understood. Thanks, Dave.", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ellis with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Bob Simpson", "Morning, John.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Morning guys.", "Bob Simpson", "Jon, how are you doing?", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Morning guys. All right. So Dave, maybe just start the first question around landfill pricing. I know you gave the MSW figure. Do you have overall landfill pricing?", "David Steiner", "Yeah. Overall landfill pricing was \u2013 let me just look at my notes here. Overall land fill pricing is positive, 0.6%. When you throw in the transfer stations, it's positive 1.2%, the yield, not the per unit basis.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Sure. Okay. The MSW volumes at the land fill. If I have this correctly, there was a pretty healthy deceleration in terms of the year-over-year rate of decline between the second and third quarters. Anything that happened there, contract losses or anything else, we should be sensitive to in the third quarter, related to MSW volume?", "David Steiner", "We had a couple of contract losses in our Eastern Group up in the New York area and then we had another contract loss in Montreal. That's what drove the difference.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Okay. Great. Just turning your attention to special waste. Can you help us just to understand, when you look at the fourth quarter and you talked about the special waste being a contributing factor. How much of a benefit is it expected to be? And maybe just help us understand, if you can, parse out a permanent special waste, versus more the event type of work that you're anticipating?", "David Steiner", "You know when we look at that, you know and it is interesting. It goes back again to what we talked about before, the customer focus growth, the segmentation piece. We now have a lot of specialized sales people that are with our manufacturing industrial customers, basically on a 24 hour a day, seven day a week type of basis. So they get to know what their needs are. And it's really helped us to get a little bit better visibility on the pipeline. And so, when we look at the pipeline, at least in the fourth quarter, we expect special waste to continue to be strong.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then just turning your attention quickly to the residential business. I think Dave, last quarter, you talked a little bit about some competitive challenges, in that business, in part, tied to where CPI is. What did you see in the third quarter? Were you still seeing some competitive challenges? Were you able to get reasonable price increases on some of those contracts?", "David Steiner", "Yeah. You're exactly right, Jonathan. The CPI certainly has hindered us there. I don't think you see a dramatic change on the residential side from the competitive point of view. I mean, you all know this business as well as I do. That is that you are always going to have, on the smaller local contracts. You are always going to have the local and regional players that sometimes are going to bid very low. But, I don't see any particular competitive change in that landscape. From a pricing point of view, obviously it's going to be driven by CPI. We've got a little bit less of a headwind of that, it went from 100 basis points to 60 basis points this quarter. But we don't see that 60 basis points really abating over the next quarter or two.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Just from a broader perspective, going into the fourth quarter \u2013 you talked to, it is helpful \u2013 I appreciate the clarity on SG&A in the forth quarter. I guess what I struggle with though, is if SG&A dollars are going to be comparable year-over-year, to get to the guidance that you've laid out, unless there's another line item that I am not forecasting accurately, that your gross margin can't really show much variation from third quarter lows. And it's given typical seasonality. I guess I'm trying to figure out how you're going to be able to hold gross margins flat quarter-over-quarter. Are you expecting some kind of volume gain in some end market, or cost savings enough to offset typical seasonal head winds in that regard?", "David Steiner", "I think it is more the latter I think, Jonathan. We're expecting to see a normal seasonality this year, which we didn't see last year really, see much of. I think it's more that the cost controls we put in place implied SG&A. But to a certain extent they played a cost of operations as well. So I think that's where your answer is.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Okay. Great. And then just my final question. Medical Waste \u2013 Dave, can you offer us any insight into where the revenue base for that stands now? And then you talked about being profitable in the second half of 2011. Do you have sort of a minimum revenue threshold you think needs be achieved in order to gain that profitability?", "David Steiner", "Yeah. It's exactly the type of thing we look at, Jonathan. So right now, we've got revenue in that line of business. And when we look at the revenue, as we move to a healthcare segment, we include a lot of our typical solid waste in that segment. But, so when I'm talking about Medical Waste, I'm talking about strictly our new medical waste initiatives, not talking about the solid waste that we might pick up from health care providers that we've done for many years.", "And so, in that business, it's about $20 million to $25 million of revenue, right now. Like I said, we're starting to see our value proposition take hold. We'd expect to add, probably 50 to 100 hospitals, over the next six months to that revenue base. And then next year or so, you're talking about a normalized base of about $40 million, then next year we expect that to go up somewhere between 50% to 75%.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.", "Bob Simpson", "Thank, Scott.", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities.", "Bob Simpson", "Hello, Al.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "Morning, Bob, morning David.", "David Steiner", "Morning.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "Morning Jim as well, I guess there.", "Jim Alderson", "Good morning.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "I want to come back to MSW here and maybe press you, David, a little bit on this. But we're in obviously, some turning point on the volume and that positive comps, although it's not happened yet. Price, it appears, a little bit a challenge from CPI. But I was wondering if you can comment on the dynamic between your comments about aggressive pricing, the level of competition you're seeing and the ability to drive 3% yield, next year in particular. Is this \u2013", "David Steiner", "Now remember that 3% on the land fill side.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "Okay. But overall, on MSW, what are you targeting or suggesting we look at? Because it still seems like a very challenging price environment, let alone volume environment.", "David Steiner", "There's no doubt about it. It still continues to be a challenging environment. We haven't seen the MSW turn positive. But look, you all know that landfill pricing is what drives our business. And landfill pricing, when we look at it from an internal point of view, landfill pricing is a huge cost component to our collections lines of business. So if we're going to continue to get those collection price increases that we want to get, we've got to charge ourselves more at the landfill. That applies to third parties too. So, as we look at pricing next year, we are going to take opportunities where we have both gate-rated and contracted volumes, we're going to take the opportunities to push price. When you look at our overall yield for the company, we're running in the 8% to 10% price increase on our commercial customers. On the commercial customers that we can touch, we're running about 8% to 10% price increases. Over time, I think we need to get to that point at the land fill.", "Now it\u2019s going to be right. It's going to be a step process. It's going to happen \u2013 it's certainly easier to do that when the volumes turn positive. But we've got to move from that 3% yield at the landfill, we've got to start moving that toward the 8% type of price increases we're getting in our collection business. We've got to do that and we're going to do it just like we did our pricing program on our collection business. We're going to do it. And we're going to hold firm. And we may suffer some losses from it. But in the long run it's the right thing to do for our business.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "We should actually probably think about some churn in the customer level, if you hold firm on pricing.", "David Steiner", "Wouldn't surprise me.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "Right. Okay. Thank you. And then on specialty waste. It sounds as if this has become more of a permanent component to your stickiness with larger customers, particularly on commercial and industrial. And so, should we start to think about \u2013 how do we think about what would be defined as specialty waste and how that could help on volumes? Particularly as we rotate into a more seasonal pattern in the industry.", "David Steiner", "Yeah. It's a great question. And frankly, as we've started to see the changeover, we haven't done reporting to reflect the change over. In 2011, we probably ought to start looking at our special waste and trying to give you all a little bit more color around the specificity of the difference between the permanent and the temporary. I'll put that on Bob's to-do list for 2011.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "I think that would be helpful. Not for Bob's purpose, but for us. Ands then as a tie-in here on for Bob, I'm a little \u2013 maybe it is also David. It's hard to comment that this is $0.60 of EPS in the quarter, when you are making some investments and longer term strategy of value drivers. So, is this really a $0.55 quarter, in terms of kind of the normal recurring things? And then there's maybe a couple of cents of other special items? I'm concerned that we're going to start looking out forward here, with a number that's really probably more $0.55 and $0.60. I'm just wondering.", "David Steiner", "Yeah. When I look at it from an operational point of view, we have been as reported at $0.55. You've got $0.02 from Wheelabrator that should be one-time. Again, we'll have a little more of that, but not the $0.02 a quarter type of hit. So, from an operational point of view you look at it at $0.57. And then you've these growth initiatives, which we are going to have, that drag. But we're not going to have that drag forever. That is not going be a permanent part of our business. You're going to see that drag start to lesson next year and then you see it go away, in the second half of next year.", "So when I look at the business, what we try to do, is to say, what is the fundamental underlying nature of our Collection-Disposal business and how did that perform? And then you take out the nonrecurring piece of Wheelabrator and the piece that will recur, but not forever. It'll start to turn positive, second half of 2011. And so we were just trying to give you all a feel for the soundness of the underlying core business.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "One final thing, if I may. Are you willing to comment on the volume of bags on the Bagster that you need to drive above breakeven? I'm sure we can figure it out on some math.", "David Steiner", "Yeah. When we look at it, it's probably right around 800 to 1,000 bags per day that we need to pick up, in order to break even. The good news is, we've had an 800 bag day in the last two weeks. It'll be interesting to see, as this product develops, what effect seasonality will have on it. So we hate to predict, obviously at 800 bags a day, we've become \u2013 breakeven. The question is, when are you going to do 300 bags a day, not knowing what the effect of winter will have on this product. Is it going to act like our normal business? Or are people going to continue to buy them and have them picked up during the winter? A little early to call, but It's roughly 800 to 1,000 bags per day for us to hit, breakeven.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "Thank you very much.", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Wunderlich Securities.", "Bob Simpson", "Morning, Michael.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Hi. Good morning. If we could talk a little bit about the free cash flow outlook. If all my scribbling is right, your year-to-date, kind of a negative working capital number of about $200 million, so do we get help on that in the fourth quarter?", "Bob Simpson", "A little bit, Michael. That $200 million will come down $50 million to $75 million.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Okay. And then, in the fourth quarter, bonus depreciation should be impacted and reflect on your cash taxes. So, there's a cash tax issue that's not part of your original guidance. So, is that upside to the guidance?", "Bob Simpson", "Yeah. It's considered in the 1.2 to 1.3, Michael, but it's part of the reason why I think this number there's some real opportunity for upside.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Okay. And then, to get your target of $1.2 billion in capital spending, you've got to spend almost $500 million. Is that realistic?", "Bob Simpson", "Michael, we've done it before. But it \u2013 it's possible. It's very possible that we won't get it all done. But given the tax benefit we get this year, for the spending we do-do, I think it is going to \u2013 I think it's likely we'll try to get all that done.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Okay. And is there likely to pull anything, $500 million is hard enough to do anyway, but would you be able to pull forward, so there's some out of 11 to capture more of the benefit?", "Bob Simpson", "We don't really plan on doing that Michael. We've got enough to get done just with what we have on the plate right now.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "And then, David, on the medical health care numbers, if I \u2013 I don't have it in front of me, but I remember from March. You're talking about your health care revenues were sort of 3% of a $10 billion market. So you were $300 million. And I have, in my notes that you were $75 million in what I'd call the \"Red Bag business,\" so I'm a little confused on the data you gave today, but can you clarify that relative to sort of what we learned in March?", "David Steiner", "Yes. I'm a little bit confused on your notes. I don't think we've ever said we had $75 million of Red Bag waste. We may have said that that's our target over the next two years; frankly I don't know where that number comes from, Michael. What we've always said is, we think in the three to five year timeframe, we should have a $300 million business.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "So it\u2019s not $300 million yet, of total health care?", "David Steiner", "No, no doubt about it. Well, take that back, if you look at our solid waste business. Right? As I recall, Michael, if you look at just \u2013 oh you're talking about the solid waste out the back door, not the medical waste.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Yes. And again, I'm working without your slide presentation in front of me. But I had in my notes that you had $300 million of health care industry revenues, which is a mixture of all services.", "David Steiner", "Yes. If your numbers are correct and I don't have those numbers in front of me, but what we were talking about, is that we do business in the health care segment today. Right. We pick up solid waste from hospitals; we pick up recycling from hospitals. And so it's not like we're going into a segment where we have absolutely no business. We do have a base business that we can bundle with medical waste. Bob's looking to see what the actual number is. But certainly, we have the $300 million that you used, 3% of the market wouldn't surprise me if that's, I mean that\u2019s\u2026", "We're certainly, what I do know, Michael, is that from the Solid Waste point of view, if you look at our overall market share in business, we're at sort of 25% of the market. We are hugely under represented on the Solid Waste and Recycling side in the medical arena. So that is part of what's going on here. We're trying to beef up both our Medical Waste and our Solid Waste, in a segment where we're hugely under represented today.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Okay. All right. And then lastly on the landfill side on the MSW, I know this is a stretch, but if you were to pull out these contracts. And I'm not trying to make funny numbers, just that whatever the same store basis was in extra cost business, lost contracts, what's happening in MSW on the same store basis?", "David Steiner", "It's basically, flat quarter to quarter. We've been running, sort of in that negative 1% to negative 2%, the last couple of quarters at MSW. And it's basically flat.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Okay. So, I mean a 5% down is scary, if it was to lost three contracts, so if I pull that out, I'm really \u2013 flat is consistent with the trend of, in recurring small container business, there's been a little bit more tonnage?", "David Steiner", "That's correct. I mean, in other words, we looked at that number. And it went down fairly dramatically in the quarter. And we said, is that an economic sign or is that just losing some contracts? And after looking at it, we said, it's not an economic sign; it is more of just lost contracts.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Okay. So I'm not asking you to all of a sudden to go being a lawyer, to a CEO, to an economist, but when you look at your business, do you look at the U.S. economy as being stable, slow growth, but it's stable?", "David Steiner", "I think that's exactly what we see in our volume. That's why I keep saying, if there was one indicator to me that we look at in our business to say, what's going on in our economy, it'd be our commercial volumes. And again, the commercial volumes have basically been sort of flat, which tells me that what we've got is a stable, slow growth economy. Certainly what you hear from the people that are experts in the economy, which isn't me, what you hear is that they expect that to continue.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "So In that type of business environment, that's the sort of the outlook for a while. You change how you run your company differently, as far as objectives over the next three to five years and where that goes, is the nature of the amount of free cash that can be driven out of it?", "Bob Simpson", "Michael, I think it causes you to do a couple of things. One is, you try to find a better way to service your customers, so that you can retain your customers and generate more revenue at a relatively flat environment. And you want to do that by the customer service, not by using price as a tool.", "And second, you have to really take a good hard look at your cost structure and find better ways using technology, using better processes, to bring your costs down over time. And we're actually taking a look at both of those we talked about the cost measures we took for the fourth quarter, to bring our costs better under control than they have in the past.", "And we'll continue to look using technology, using better process, look for better ways to run our business, to reduce our cost structure overall, so that we can generate more cash and return that cash to our shareholders.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "All right. And then to that end. You had an internal goal, your own goal, of 9% of SG&A over the next 24 months. Do you feel good about that, still?", "Bob Simpson", "Actually, I do, Michael. The goal is to be at that run rate at the end of 2012. That hasn't changed. We're taking steps now to make sure we get that done.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "All right. Thanks very much.", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of Bill Fisher with Raymond James.", "David Steiner", "Hey, Bill.", "Bill Fisher \u2013 Raymond James", "Hey, good morning. I wanted to follow up on that commercial. You've had some success on the new business ads versus losses, but I think volumes have kind of remained stubbornly negative. You mentioned you've got an 8% to 10% pricing on \u2013 this issue can raise? Is the churn a bit up there; is some of that acceptable, if you're getting that type of increase? Or, can you just touch on some of the factors that hit that volume line?", "David Steiner", "Yes. And I think you've hit the nail right on the head, Bill. The churn rate is up slightly, from 10.6% to 10.8% in the quarter. We liked to see that churn rate under 10%. But, you know, we've talked a lot about the leverage that you get on price versus volume and certainly we still see that trade-off as being positive.", "In other words, we're going to continue to push price because the leverage you get across your customer base, makes up for that slight increase in churn but, look we've got to work to get that churn rate below 10% and get the price. That's what our customer focus growth is all about. It's about being able to drive down the churn rate and continue get that kind of level of pricing.", "Bill Fisher \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay. Great. And can you give us, Bob, I know you're not through '10 yet, but on 2011 CapEx, if you think about some of the things that may move that around, if your volumes stay neutral here looking forward, could that number be down? Or just some IT spending or what are some of the things that might move that around next year?", "Bob Simpson", "We'll give more specific guidance on that in February, but there are two things to keep in mind. Number one, we have not spent as much this year on the fleet side, because of the new engine, so we're going to want to be including that in our spend and also, I'd expect we'll spend a little bit more, continue to spend more on the growth side.", "Part of the way we enable growth is through IT, so I do think you'll see a little more. But I'm not saying our CapEx spending will be substantially higher. It may be we'll talk about more about that in February.", "David Steiner", "Then Bill, if we see the legislature pass, the bill where they talked about allowing companies to expense capital, which I think passed through the senate and they've got to get it through the house. But if you see that happen, which I think would be great for the economy, by the way. But if you see that happen that has the ability to change the game next year.", "Now for us, what does that mean? That doesn't mean we're going to double our CapEx that means incrementally, we might spend a couple of hundred million dollars more, if we can expense it. But I think Bob's right the real drivers next year are going to be, we have to put a little bit more money into our fleet. And we'll continue to spend on renewable energy and growth.", "Bill Fisher \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "David Steiner", "Thanks, Bill.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley.", "David Steiner", "Morning, Vance.", "Vance Edelson \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Just following up on the last question. Given the potential spending on fleet and so forth, could you comment, in a broader sense, on the operating leverage going forward, beyond the SG&A restraint, if volumes gradually show signs of life as expected? Do you have the parked trucks and the other excess capacity that could bring positive margin implications along with it?", "Bob Simpson", "We've got parked trucks on the roll-off side. And I think as the roll-off, the temporary business, the permanent roll-off business picks up, I think there won't be a need for a substantial amount of fleet there. On the commercial side, we have some to use too. I don't think you'll see us having to spend too much more. The fleet spend is going to be, really in two areas, one is, replacing really out of date trucks that we need to replace and at some point in time you have \u2013 most of those have been put off to the side of the road, by the way.", "But there will be a need to do some of that and then we're also continuing to look at CNG fuel trucks. That's a scenario that we think has great promise we have one of the largest alternative fuel fleets in the country and we intend to continue to develop that.", "David Steiner", "But Vance, it really is a great question because, having those parked trucks does affect our capital spend. And the way I look at it is, we'd like to spend on the fleet next year but on the other hand, because of that excess capacity that we've have had in the system, because of volumes the last 2.5 years, our average fleet age is still 7.5 years. Our average fleet age really hasn't gone up, despite the fact that, as Bob said; we underinvested in the fleet because of the new engines.", "So, that gives us some flexibility to say, okay if volumes are flat, we may not need to invest as much in our fleet. And if volumes bounce back, we can invest in our fleet. It gives us some flexibility we aren't required to invest in our fleet next year, because using excess trucks has allowed us to keep our fleet age flat. So it gives us some great flexibility.", "And as Bob said, if we can \u2013 if some of our customers are demanding CNG trucks, from our point of view, those are actually less costly than a diesel truck. And so if we can move \u2013 if we can satisfy customers' needs and drive down our operating costs, that's a win-win for our investment.", "Vance Edelson \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. That's great color. Thanks for that. And you mentioned a couple of the headwinds. The Bagster and Medical Waste have been highlighted. How about the Whole Foods kiosks or any other similar initiatives are there any start up headwinds there, or is it more the Bagster and the Medical Waste?", "David Steiner", "Yes. Certainly there's some start up costs there, but the good news about that is, those are leased facilities and so we basically get the revenue as we make the acquisition. So we haven't seen \u2013 there's not a material effect on earnings from that.", "Vance Edelson \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Got it. Last question from me. Regarding Bag debt, I think you mentioned the good effort being made collecting. Any changes in the bad debt profile? Has that become at all harder to contain? Especially, if we think, going forward, that might be the prospect of higher churn in the issues there?", "Bob Simpson", "Our performance has really \u2013 our accounts receivable performance has really been pretty remarkable over the last couple of years. And what we're finding is that our older budgets are getting better and better, they're not getting worse in this downturn. We don't see any real (inaudible). By the way, I don't know if you guys can hear static on the line, we certainly apologize for that if you\u2026", "Vance Edelson \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "I am getting the static too. It might be my line. Assuming that's it for my questions, hopefully the static goes away.", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "Vance Edelson \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rick Skidmore with Goldman Sachs.", "Rick Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Good morning. Just to follow up on a couple of points. First on the customer churn. Does a loss customer go out at a higher price in margin than the new customers come in? And ultimately does that mean you have to be more aggressive on the pricing elsewhere?", "David Steiner", "Yeah. Actually, what we\u2019ve seen is that our new business, loss business customers this quarter on the commercial side were about equal. And when you look at our industrial side, we actually are bringing in customers at a higher rate than we're losing them, at a higher rate per unit than we're losing them. So actually that's positive. It hadn't always been the case, but that happens to be the case this quarter.", "Rick Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And then just lastly, just on the SG&A maybe, if Bob could just talk about some of the key buckets that you're targeting to get to that 9%.", "Bob Simpson", "I think the buckets will cover, certainly paper costs and engine. All of the costs associated with processing the information that we processed today. You know, one item that we like to talk about, is that our order to cash, these numbers are representative or they're actually right. There's like 35 steps in our order to capture process and 31 of them are manual. If we could turn it to where there's only 25 steps and 21 of them only core manual, that says a lot of savings to be had there a lot less (inaudible)\u2026", "Rick Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Great. Thank you.", "Bob Simpson", "Thank you.", "Operator", "No further questions at this time. Do you have any closing remarks?", "David Steiner", "No, we apologize for the static that seems to have popped up on the phone. Thank you all for joining us and we'll see you next year (technical difficulty).", "Operator", "Thank you for participating in today's conference call.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2010 earnings conference call. With me this morning are David Steiner, Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Simpson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "David will start things off with a summary of the financial results for the quarter and a review of the details of our revenue growth, including price and volume trends. Bob will cover operating costs and the financial statement. We will conclude with questions and answers. During their statements, any comparisons made by David and Bob, unless otherwise stated, will be with the fourth quarter of 2009.", "Before we get started, let me remind you that in addition to our press release that was issued this morning, we have filed a Form 8-K that includes the press release as an attachment and is available on our website at wm.com.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of Waste Management is prohibited.", "Now I will turn the call over to Waste Management's CEO, David Steiner.", "David Steiner", "Thanks, Jim, and good morning from Houston. We had a very good fourth quarter, earning $0.60 per share, an increase of over 15% compared to the $0.52 we earned in the prior-year quarter. Our Collection, Landfill and Recycling businesses all performed very solidly. We increased operating earnings and improved operating margins in each of these lines of business. Revenue increased by $181 million or 6% from the prior-year period. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. ", "Our revenue improvement was driven by better Recycling commodity prices, acquisitions and year-over-year increases in revenue growth from yield. On the pricing front, the fourth quarter was our strongest quarter of the year. Internal revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal operations was 2.6% in the fourth quarter. We remain committed to our pricing discipline and in the fourth quarter, we again overcame the pricing headwind we faced on the roughly 40% of our collection revenue that has price adjustments based on a CPI index.", "CPI adjustment had caused a drag to our revenue growth from yield of approximately 40 basis points in the quarter and about 70 basis points for the year. So for both the quarter and the full year, we outpaced our long-term pricing objective to achieve price increases in the range of 50 to 100 basis points above CPI on our entire Collection and Disposal business.", "The combined internal revenue growth from yield in the industrial, commercial and residential lines of our Collection business was 3.1% in the fourth quarter. Internal revenue growth from yield was 3.5% in both our commercial and industrial lines. While internal revenue growth from yield on our residential line of business was 2.2%.", "Commercial new business pricing increased for the sixth consecutive quarter. Service increases, net of service decreases, were slightly negative for the quarter but improved significantly compared with the prior-year quarter. The winter quarters are typically the weakest of the year for service increases, net of decreases.", "On the volume side of the business, internal revenue growth from volume in our Collection and Disposal business declined by 1.8% in the quarter. At the end of October, volumes were trending such that we expected volumes to be flat or slightly up for the quarter. However, the severe winter weather we saw in December negatively impacted volumes. Also impacting volumes were contract losses in our residential line of business and a slowing in the rate of growth in the special waste landfill volumes.", "For the fourth quarter, commercial and residential collection lines saw declines of 5% and 5.9%, respectively. In our Industrial line of business, internal revenue growth from volume was down 3%, an improvement from prior quarters. Our strong pricing in our traditional Solid Waste Collection business overcame these volume losses and drove margin improvement. Overall, in the fourth quarter, we grew collection income from operations margin by 220 basis points compared with the prior-year period.", "In the landfill side of the business, fourth quarter 2010 internal revenue growth from volume was positive 4.3%, which is the best quarterly performance for the year and the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year volume improvement. Internal revenue growth from volume for special waste was positive 12.5%. For MSW, internal revenue growth from volume was negative 5%. In our C&D line, internal revenue growth from volume was flat, which is the best performance since the fourth quarter of 2008.", "On the landfill pricing front, MSW per unit pricing was up by 2.4%, reflecting our continued focus on landfill pricing. So our Landfill business also improved significantly in the quarter and we continue to see a strong pipeline for special waste volumes.", "Overall, we grew income from operations in the landfill line of business and increased the income from operations margin by 190 basis points compared with the prior-year period. ", "When we look at our collection and landfill line businesses combined, income from operations grew approximately 12% compared with the fourth quarter of 2009, and our income from operations margin improved by 210 basis points.", "Turning to our Recycling business, increased commodity prices contributed about $0.04 of positive year-over-year earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2010. For 2011, we expect recycling commodity sales prices to have a slightly positive year-over-year impact on earnings per share. Average electricity sales prices at our waste-to-energy plants were flat in the fourth quarter. For 2011, we expect average electricity sales prices to be similar to 2010 levels and therefore, we do not expect electricity sales prices to significantly impact earnings in 2011 compared with 2010.", "Looking at volumes in 2011, we expect them to be flat to slightly positive, with volumes steadily improving throughout the year. Certainly, the severe winter weather in the first quarter of 2011 has affected volumes, and we expect this to have a negative impact on first quarter earnings. But starting in the second quarter of 2011, we expect volumes to resume the previous trend of slow but steady improvement. With respect to price, CPI is running at about approximately 1%, and we expect CPI headwinds in our Residential and Franchise business to continue.", "We've also seen more competitive pricing on new residential municipal contracts. So the pricing headwinds in 2011 will come primarily from our residential line of business. We will continue to aggressively push industrial, commercial and landfill prices. As a result, we expect our overall yield in 2011 to be 2%.", "Our waste-to-energy operations are expected to have a negative impact of about $28 million on earnings in the first half of 2011 compared with 2010, primarily from upgrades being made at our recently-acquired waste-to-energy plant in Virginia. Our waste-to-energy operations are expected to have a positive impact of about $11 million in the second half of 2011. We expect increased labor costs due primarily to annual merit increases, which will add approximately $65 million to 2011 expenses. We're planning to increase expenses by up to $50 million for information technology upgrades, start-up costs associated with new cost-saving programs and customer-focused growth initiatives. Interest expense is expected to increase approximately $25 million principally because of higher fees and rates from the revolving credit facility that was executed in June of 2010.", "We've previously discussed certain growth initiatives that had negative $0.03 impact to earnings in the third quarter. The headwinds from those initiatives were about the same in the fourth quarter. We expect to see the results from these initiatives continue to negatively impact earnings in the first half of the year but to turn positive by the end of the year. So when we look ahead to 2011, we'll face some headwinds, mostly in the first half of the year. But our strategy remains clear. We'll remain committed to our pricing discipline while at the same time investing in the future.", "In looking at our first quarter, our preliminary data shows that January 2011 earnings were basically flat year-over-year, driven by negative volumes and start-up spending on new cost-reduction initiatives that will be implemented in 2011. The negative volumes were driven by the severe winter weather experienced throughout North America, and we expect that to abate as we enter the spring season and to improve throughout the year.", "We've also begun to bring in internal and external resources to develop cost-saving plans, and the spending on those resources are not yet offset by savings. We expect the savings to begin to occur in the second half of the year and to accelerate in 2012. So earnings improvement will be muted in the first half of the year and pick up in the second half of the year. Overall, we estimate our 2011 fully diluted earnings to be between $2.24 and $2.30 per share.", "In summary, our results in the fourth quarter build strong momentum going into 2011. Our entire organization is aligned around our pricing and cost savings strategies. This will serve us well in accomplishing our goals of growing our revenue, expanding our operating margins, increasing our return on invested capital, increasing our free cash flow and returning cash to our shareholders. ", "And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.", "Robert Simpson", "Thank you, David. I will begin by discussing operating costs. These costs increased by $77 million in the fourth quarter but improved 110 basis points as a percentage of revenue to 61.2%. Cost of goods sold increased $67 million in the quarter, mainly because of rebates due to higher recycling commodity prices. Because of these higher prices, earnings per diluted share at our recycling operations increased approximately $0.04 in the quarter. Subcontractor costs increased $22 million in the quarter, primarily relating to the work we performed on the cleanup effort in the Gulf Coast region. Maintenance costs decreased $14 million. Direct fuel costs increased approximately $9 million, primarily because of a 15% increase in diesel fuel prices. The increase in our fuel costs was less than the increase in our fuel surcharge revenue for the quarter, providing a $5 million benefit to income from operations. ", "Foreign currency translation for our Canadian operations accounted for an increase in operating costs of approximately $7 million. SG&A costs were $367 million in the fourth quarter. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A costs improved 60 basis points to 11.5%. Interest expense for the fourth quarter increased by $9 million compared with the prior-year period. This is primarily due to higher upfront costs in usage fees on the new revolving credit facility which we executed in June 2010. ", "On December 31, 2010, our weighted average cost of debt was 5.6%, and our debt-to-total capital ratio for the quarter was 57.5%, consistent with our target ratio of about 60%. The floating rate portion of our total Debt portfolio was 13% at the end of the quarter. Our income tax rate, as reported for the fourth quarter 2010, was 35.1%. After adjusting for the items referenced in our press release, our income tax rate for the fourth quarter would have been 36.6%. For 2011, we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 35.7%.", "Turning to cash flow, fourth quarter 2010 net cash provided by operating activities was $622 million. During the fourth quarter, we received a benefit of about $50 million from a reduction of our federal income tax payments due to bonus depreciation. Our capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $367 million and our free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $263 million. For the full year 2010, free cash flow was about $1.2 billion after capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion. Our 2010 cash provided by operating activities was negatively impacted by the changes in working capital, primarily an increase in accounts receivable due to our strong revenue growth.", "For 2011, we expect capital expenditures of between $1.35 billion and $1.45 billion. We have increased our capital spending plans to take advantage of the bonus depreciation legislation recently passed. The additional spend will focus on natural gas vehicles and fueling infrastructure, IT infrastructure and growth initiatives. In 2011, we expect our free cash flow benefit from bonus depreciation of between $110 million and $140 million. Free cash flow in 2011 is expected to be in the range of $1.25 billion and $1.35 billion despite the increase in capital expenditures.", "In the fourth quarter of 2010, we paid $150 million in dividend, and we repurchased $58 million of our common stock. For the full year 2010, we paid $604 million in dividends, and we repurchased $501 million of our common stock. As you know, our capital allocation program over the past few years has been very clear, return cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while opportunistically making strategic investments and acquiring assets. ", "For 2011, our capital allocation plan is to return up to $1.2 billion to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. The plan anticipates increasing future declared dividends by 8% to $1.36 per share on an annual basis, which would result in a dividend yield of approximately 3.7%. We also intend to repurchase as much as $575 million of common stock. We expect to spend between $250 million and $350 million in business acquisitions and investments, with the majority of these investments on the Solid Waste side of the business. ", "The cost savings program that David mentioned will focus on procurement, operational efficiency and back-office efficiency. The implementation costs of these initiatives will cause a drag on earnings in the first half of 2011. However, we expect to begin to realize the benefits of these initiatives in the second half of 2011, and they should accelerate through 2012. Despite the cost of these initiatives, we expect full year 2011 SG&A costs to decline as a percentage of revenue. Coupled with improved operating performance, we expect income from operations margins to continue to improve in 2011.", "Finally, some news about our Investor Relations area. We have recently named Ed Egle [ph] as Director, Investor Relations. Ed will be taking over from Jim Alderson, who is recently named Director of Finance for our waste-to-energy operations in the United Kingdom. Congratulations, Jim, on his new position, and we thank him for his contributions to Investor Relations. ", "Ed was recently Director of Financial Analysis and has over 15 years of experience with our company both in the field and at the corporate office. He'll be able to hit the ground running. Ed will be reporting to our Vice President of Finance and Treasurer, Cherie Rice, who will continue to oversee the Investor Relations program, as she has done the last several years. We will be introducing Ed to you at Investor Meetings during the coming months. ", "And with that, Nicole, let's open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Levine with JPMorgan.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "David, I think you flagged for Q4 the impact of storms on the volume growth, but the price and the margins both came in above our expectations for the quarter. So if you could normalize for the storms specifically, could you characterize the results relative to your expectations into the quarter and maybe any pleasant or negative surprises relative to internal expectations?", "David Steiner", "Scott, I think overall, I think we were pretty much in line from an operating basis. Frankly, we did worse on volumes than we thought we'd do. We did a lot better than we thought we'd do on both the price and cost. And so when we looked at the quarter, we saw October trending volumes, as I recall, October volumes were negative 0.4%, and so we sort of saw the volumes trending toward positive like we thought would happen in the fourth quarter. Obviously, the winter storm started hitting in sort of mid-December and that in December, as I recall, was negative 4.9% in volumes. And so you can see the dramatic change that we believe the weather had in December. And so, overall, the volumes were disappointing, but there was nothing we could do about it. The two things that we could do something about on the cost side and on the yield side, we exceeded our expectations.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And regarding the municipal contracts, the residential contracts that you flagged, were those recent developments? And can you quantify the impact in basis points of the hit to volumes associated with that?", "David Steiner", "Yes, when you look at residential contracts -- look, our pricing program over the last few years has been sort of an up or out mentality with respect to residential contracts. We've raised prices basically across the board. As we look at that, we're going to look at those contracts that we have, particularly where we already have the capital invested, and we're going to look at them purely from a return-on-capital point of view. We're going to keep the contracts that give us sufficient return on capital, and we're going to let them go when we have competitors that are putting out prices there that don't meet our hurdles from a return-on-capital point of view. The losses have been fairly widespread. The numbers that I have seen recently show that it's about $33 million. You can translate that into basis points, but it was about $33 million of residential contract that we lost year-over-year.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "So is that -- it sounds like it's kind of a trend, and maybe that's evolving and your expectations that's -- kind of it is what it is, and we'll kind of watch and monitor?", "David Steiner", "No, not really. I mean, when we talked in the last year about the customer-focused growth, one of the things that we did is we put an emphasis on our municipal contracts. And just like we're looking at in our other customer segments, we're going to look at this customer segment as to how do we create a value proposition for the customer such that price doesn't become the primary driving factor. So when you look at municipal contracts, you've got to find out what municipalities want. And today, what they want are more options for diversion. So we're going to give them more options from a recycling point of view, from an organics point of view. If you can do that, you can create value out of the materials. If you can recycle more materials and create value that you can then can share with the customer, we can get the contract at a higher price, or at least at a higher return on capital. And so going forward, we are not going to go out and compete on price. That's never been our strategy in any line of business. But we are going to compete to maintain those contracts that give us a good return on capital, and then we're going to try to find a way to meet the customers' need better than anyone else in the industry.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And one last one, if I may, the D&A came in a little bit lower than we were looking for in the quarter. Is there anything unusual there? Or how did that come in relative to internal?", "Robert Simpson", "It was a little bit lower than we thought. We have every year at the end of the fourth quarter, we have a certain amount of adjustments we make due to capping closure, post-closure analysis. We do landfill to landfill. This year, that number was just a little bit higher than what it was last year, and last year was probably pretty typical, but that's what drove the D&A down. You'll see that it happened last year in the fourth quarter as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ellis with BoA Merrill Lynch.", "Jonathan Ellis - BofA Merrill Lynch", "First question I want to ask about is just on your pricing outlook for 2011. Can you help us to understand what you're assuming for pricing in your CPI-based revenue versus non-CPI-based revenue? And then within the CPI based component, is all that tied to CPI for '10? Or is some of that more realtime where '11 CPI will drive the pricing in some of those markets?", "David Steiner", "Yes, it's really -- all those contracts are different. Some of them are localized CPI, some of them are more regionalized and national CPIs, some try to get to sort of a waste industry-specific type of CPI. So they're all over the board. What we looked at for CPI in the year was about 1% to 1.3% on CPI. And so you can do the math there to figure out what effect that has on the overall yield for the year. And then I think the other thing to keep in mind is that we anniversaried a lot of our fees. So for example, our environmental fee, our minimum ton-per-load fee, our administrative fee, that's about $50 million of headwinds. All the fees and surcharges, we're expecting to be year-over-year about a $50 million headwind, which tells you that we've got to do a pretty good job on price increases to hit our 2% goal. If you remember last year, in order to hit our goal, we had to have an average price increase on our open-market Commercial business of about 8%. And that type of trend continues this year. I mean, in order to get to our 2%, we've got further headwinds to overcome from CPI and from the various fees and surcharges. And so we expect the open-market portion of our Commercial business to be in the 6% to 8% range.", "Jonathan Ellis - BofA Merrill Lynch", "And then just on the landfill side, David, I know you talked in the past about working towards a pricing growth target of 8% to 10%. Can you give us some sense of where you think you may be able to get to this year on landfill pricing?", "David Steiner", "Yes, just a rule of thumb, you sort of assume that those are three-year contracts, so you hit about a third a year at 2.4%. You do the math and multiply it by three, and you'd figure your gate rate's up probably closer to 5% to 7%. And some of the studies I've seen that folks go out and do would verify that we're being pretty aggressive at the landfill. What we're going to do is pick a few markets where we can test our landfill pricing. We did this -- frankly, that was the first thing we did when I became CEO back in 2004, and it's time to do it again. We've got huge investments in capital in those landfills. When you look at our business over the last three years, landfill volumes have obviously been down dramatically, which has had a dramatic effect on return on invested capital, and we need to raise prices in order to get the return on capital that we expect out of our landfills. So we're going to push them across the board, but then we're also going to go out and find some markets where we can test those types of price increases that you talked about.", "Jonathan Ellis - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Just quickly on the volume side, do you have an estimate for how much of a drag is being factored in to your volume forecast from special waste this year?", "David Steiner", "No, we haven't broken it down that specifically, Jonathan.", "Jonathan Ellis - BofA Merrill Lynch", "And then just on recycling, if my math is correct based on where recycling prices are right now, which I realize you may not be assuming in your guidance, but that would imply about at least a $0.05 EPS benefit year-over-year. Do you have an estimate of where, if recycling prices held where they are right now, what that would mean for year-over-year EPS contribution in '11?", "David Steiner", "You're about right. As I recall it, if fourth quarter average pricing holds, which is basically where the prices are right now, there was a $0.04 to $0.05 benefit for the year. We expect the pricing to hold through the first quarter, but then we expect it to soften towards the back end of the year.", "Robert Simpson", "We're not as optimistic as some of the third-party information available.", "Jonathan Ellis - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Just quickly on costs, first, on the labor cost increase, if my math is correct, it looks like if I take your labor cost for '10 and then apply the dollar impact you're talking about, it's about a 3% increase. Just given where CPI is this year, can you help us understand, is there something that's driving that inflation in your labor base? Is it union contracts or anything else along those lines?", "Robert Simpson", "Jonathan, it's 2.5% is basically what we've been using as the number that we expect our wages to go up in 2011 and it's driven -- so some of it is driven by union contracts, but it's really driven by local market conditions. The thing about CPI is it doesn't capture necessarily all the costs people face. It's impacted significantly by housing, for example, at least in some ways in which it's measured. So the real cost that a lot of our folks are facing is closer to 2.5% than it is to 1%.", "Jonathan Ellis - BofA Merrill Lynch", "And then just my final question is on SG&A. I know you talked sort of qualitatively about starting to see some benefit from the investments that you're making in the second half of the year. Can you help to try to quantify that? And as we think towards 2012, what the progression may be towards that targeted 9% run rate exiting next year?", "Robert Simpson", "Well, yes. In fact, I would expect you'll see in the first two quarters of this year an impact of around $0.02 per quarter from these investments we're making in the start-up costs, and most of that will be SG&A. We've had negative. We expect though, by the way, in the second half of the year to see the benefit start to be realized to the point where for the year, it will offset, and maybe even a little better. We'll talk more about that as the year goes on. If we don't start investing in these cost savings programs, I think my ability to deliver on the 9% run rate at the end of 2012 will not be realized. So we just have to go after some of these things. We do expect to still see an improvement in SG&A during 2011, just in part by continuing to manage the other cost but also by higher revenue.", "Jonathan Ellis - BofA Merrill Lynch", "So the point is, in dollar terms, you really wouldn't start to see material impact from your cost savings initiatives on SG&A until 2012 in terms of the year-over-year...", "Robert Simpson", "You'll begin to see it in the third and fourth quarters of this year. But yes, 2012 is when you'll really see it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Credit Suisse.", "Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Just a question on the volume side. I'm curious to see what you're baking in on the commercial piece of your business for this year? You spoke of the special waste pipeline being strong. But on commercial, I know you said that sort of that business was service increases were negative relative to decreases because of seasonality. But how should we think about that business as we go through this year?", "David Steiner", "Yes, again, when we put together our guidance, we didn't go through specific elements of the volumes. But just from a commentary point of view on the commercial volumes, these will be the special waste. Special waste has held up tremendously well during the year, and we don't particularly see that changing in 2011. The pipeline still looks pretty strong. Now the pipeline there is probably only a quarter, your visibility is probably only a quarter out. But it still looks pretty strong. On the commercial side, those volumes have very stubbornly stayed sort of in the negative 5% range, and we just haven't seen a dramatic move in those volumes. And I've said it before, that I would much prefer to see those commercial volumes move toward black because I think that would be more indicative of a strong economy. They've remained stubbornly negative at about negative 5%. Hopefully, we'll see that change. But as you know, with our business, you really don't start to see the change until the spring weather breaks and folks start -- and I mean, there's not that many people as you know in the Northeast that are adding new businesses during the winter months. And so I think we'll get a better feel in the second quarter as to whether we're going to see significant improvement in commercial volumes year-over-year.", "Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And then on pricing, you spoke of open-market pricing being up 6% to 8%. You're being aggressive on the landfill side. Could you maybe add some commentary on how investors should think about the rest of the larger players following you guys? Are you going to see others be aggressive as well, or do you have to lead the charge here?", "David Steiner", "I really can't control nor comment upon what others are going to do. I can only comment upon what we're going to do. And look, I think you all recognize that everything we've done since I've been here has been focused on return on capital. And what we've seen in the last three years as volumes, you all know very well that we're very highly leveraged from a fixed cost point of view at our landfills. And so as the volumes have come down the last three years, the margins have come down fairly dramatically and the return on capital has come down fairly dramatically. We make huge investments in these landfills every year. And so if we're going to get the return on capital up, we don't have a lot of opportunity to pull out variable costs. So there's only one way to get the return on capital up, and that is to push pricing. And that's exactly what we'll do.", "Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And just last question, on the waste-to-energy side, could you just remind us what your exposure is to market pricing and whether you're still committed to growing that business aggressively? It seems like you're putting more money towards buybacks, which is a good thing, but just curious to see how you are thinking about the pipeline there?", "Robert Simpson", "With respect to the exposure to the market merchant, our merchant plans represent about 53% of the total amount of electricity we sell. And right now, we've got about 30% of that, 30 percentage points of that hedged. We'll have more hedged as the year goes on. In terms of the pipeline, we're continuing to invest in the business. We haven't changed our view of that at all.", "David Steiner", "But this year, the investment in the business will be more -- won't be out of our pocket. Last year, obviously, we made an investment in China and we bought a plant. The total of that was about $300 million. This year, China should self-fund, so we won't be making investments there. And we don't see us acquiring any plants this year. So what you'll see in waste-to-energy is that we'll continue to invest in it, but it won't be -- we won't have to put material dollars out from a capital or acquisition point of view.", "Robert Simpson", "Yes, that's right.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Wunderlich Securities.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "In your guidance of $224 million to $230 million, what share count are you using so we understand how you've modeled your share buyback?", "Robert Simpson", "We'll go dig that out for you, Michael...", "David Steiner", "But generally, we use the mid-year standard on the buyback, and I think we modeled $400 million, $500 million of share buyback.", "Robert Simpson", "$500 million , spread evenly through the year.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "And then your historic split on your -- you made a comment, David, that warrants following up. The historic split's kind of 40%, 45% first half; 55%, 60% second half earnings mix. Based on the comment you made in your prepared remarks, does that change given you're investing in the weather?", "David Steiner", "Yes, I think it does. I mean, we talked about it in the script, but the way I sort of look at the year, Michael, is that in the first two quarters, we're still going to have some headwinds from the growth initiatives that we talked about in the third quarter and a little bit this quarter. Things like Bagster and customer-focused growth. And the first two quarters of the year, that's going to be about a $0.02 per quarter drag. We've got waste-to-energy. We're going to put $28 million into refurbishing this plant in Virginia that hits in the first of the year and now goes positive '11 in the back half of the year. So you've got $0.03 of headwind in the first half from waste-to-energy, so that's a penny and a half in a quarter. And then as Bob mentioned, we're making investments in these cost savings programs to starting paying off in the back half of the year and the first two quarters, that's about $0.02 a quarter. So you've got $0.04 to $0.06 a quarter sort of investment. And then in the first quarter, we talked about the weather in January making earnings flat in January. Normally, we'd expect to see January up $0.01 or $0.02. So you've got that effect in the first quarter. So I think, very clearly, we're going to see that historical trend to be a little bit different for us this year. We certainly are going to be more back-end loaded than front-end loaded for every reason that we have, which is the price should be a little bit better in the back half of the year because CPI should get better for those contracts that reprice on June 30. The volume is going to be better because we won't have the weather coming out of the first part of the year, and we expect the economy to continue to improve. So the volume is going to get better during the course of the year. And then on the cost side, we're going to be making some investments in cost savings in the first half of the year that are going to reap the cost savings from the back half of the year. So when you look at the three primary drivers of our earnings, you're going to have some headwinds in the front part of the year, you're going to have tailwinds in the back of the year.", "Robert Simpson", "And Michael, by the way, on that share count, what we used was about 477 million shares.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "And your working capital cost you a couple of hundred million dollars this year. Why can't we get that to be at least a neutral?", "Robert Simpson", "That's a very good...", "David Steiner", "Yes.", "Robert Simpson", "I think that's a very good point and I think when your business is growing, when your revenue is growing, and your receivables are going up, it makes it a little bit harder to bring your working capital down. And this year, we added at the end of the year $157 million more in working capital, and our DSOs every quarter this year except the fourth, our DSOs improved by at least a day. In the fourth quarter, they didn't, they just stayed flat. And we've just got to do a better job.", "David Steiner", "Right. The point is that when working capital changes because revenue's higher, that's not such a bad thing.", "Robert Simpson", "I'd rather have that than -- I'd rather just have working capital to be something as neutral. I'd rather have that. And I think we'll be able to -- we're certainly working to accomplish that this year even though we're continuing to expect revenue to grow.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "It seems that it changed faster than the rate of revenue growth. And if your focus is on return on capital, is there a disconnect at the local level on the working capital side of that, that they're not  as tied to that and therefore...", "David Steiner", "You don't have collections as part of our incentive program, Michael, and maybe that would make a difference. But we continue to see improvements except for the fourth quarter. We continue to see improvements in our collection efforts. So I don't think there's much of a disconnect there. And there may have been some other noise in our cash flow from ops in this quarter that it contributed to it. And then on days payable, Michael, we get discounts for paying early. So we're not really trying to lengthen out the DPF [ph].", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "It appears that you're counting on a reasonable working capital savings, though, in '11 to hit your free cash flow target.", "Robert Simpson", "Michael, it's not that much. If we can just take as we did this year and improve it by $30 million, we'll probably be just fine.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "So what do you account for -- it's a pretty significant improvement from cash provided from operating activity to get to that free cash flow calculations and...", "Robert Simpson", "It is going to require some discipline on payables and receivables. That's really what drives our working capital.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "And then on the special waste, just so I'm clear, I mean, a great year-over-year comparison in '10, and you're still seeing good activity, but you're expecting it to be a flat comparison. That's the point.", "David Steiner", "I think we still expect it to be positive, but not nearly as positive as it was this year.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "And then, remind us of some quarterly lumpiness in that because it comes in fits and waves that we ought to be wary of as we're thinking out the year.", "David Steiner", "Yes, I mean, certainly. When we look at it, probably about 65% of our special waste is actually what we'd sort of call permanent special waste so coming out of plants where we have a contract. And then about 35% is event-related. And that 35%, obviously, changes with seasonality, and I think also changes with corporate budgets for the folks that are doing the clean-up work. And so you're going to have some lumpiness. But again, so far, going into the first quarter, we don't see the rate slowing down dramatically.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "And then help us -- the 5% negative on the Commercial business, tell us how you do that calculation because it seems like a stunningly large number. When you don't see your churn or your lost business number being that -- I mean, you didn't see a big change in your lost business number, so it's not a bankruptcy-driven thing. So how do you calculate that so we understand that in context?", "David Steiner", "I'll leave that up to the accounting folks. Being a CEO, I don't do a lot of calculating anymore.", "Robert Simpson", "Basically, Michael, I mean, it's a change in the year-over-year's unit service. Then on the commercial side of the business, we measured units by yard service.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "So it's the actual -- yards, meaning the size of the container or yards meaning actual...", "Robert Simpson", "So downsizing of the container.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "Okay, so that's how to think about it. So if you had a whole lot of 10 yarders and you went -- you came down 5% in number of yard containers.", "David Steiner", "Or you used to do three pick ups a week and now you're doing two.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "So if the service intervals had been negative to the first half then got flat but got negative again, we just need the service interval to shift to a flat. And we'd see that number start to trend progressively toward zero, is the point.", "Robert Simpson", "Or an increase in the size of the containers. I have to tell you, this is an indicator of how just the breadth of the economic -- how the economy is doing. When that starts coming back, then that's when you'll see real indications that the economy is moving.", "David Steiner", "But you know, Michael, I do think that generally, the commercial volumes are driven more by the defection rate, right? I mean, the defection rate this quarter was 9.7%, which is down 110 basis points from the third quarter. But that's going to be the primary driver of the Commercial business is defection rate. Now you've also got -- you're adding new business, too. So the primary driver is going to be the defection rate and then the net new business that you add. The rest of it is a small portion of what drives the volume number.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk with Wedbush securities.", "Albert Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc.", "I just want to push harder here on this volume outlook for '11, and I think it's a relative question here, but if price is up, churn is also up although it sounds like maybe that's decelerating. Volumes are down, and you're seeing specialty waste up, but you're guiding 0% to 1% on volumes for '11. So what's kicking in and perhaps not falling off from our perspective that the comp looks like it's pretty aggressive with the economy?", "David Steiner", "Yes, I mean, when you look at it sort from of a 10,000-foot point of view, you've got October and November that ran at negative 0.4% in October, negative 1.4% or so in November. And so you have the numbers trending. Obviously, in November, you've got the holiday season starting to kick in. But, yes, the number is starting to trend towards black, right? And that was driven through all lines of business. You've got great comparables year-to-year starting to show up in the industrial line of business, and you've got C&D and special waste holding up very handily. So everything was trending the right way until the weather hit. And this is what we faced every year when we're looking at what we're going to talk about with respect to volumes -- what we're going to talk about with respect to volumes for the year. Is negative 4.9% in December indicative of weather? Or is it indicative of a softening economy? In other words, what do you base 2011 volumes off of? Do you base it off the negative 0.4% in October or the negative 4.9% in December? And when we look at it, we think that you can compare it more to October than December because of the weather event. Now January has continued to be soft. Again, we believe it's because of weather, not because of the economy. So again, it's the same thing we're faced with every year, where we really don't know if our volume call is going to be right until we come out into the seasonally up months that start in the spring. Why do we think it's going to be flat for the year? Because we expect to see GDP positive this year. We have no reason to believe that special waste will drop off dramatically during the course of the year. We expect industrial volumes to continue to improve, and then we expect to see improvement on the commercial line of business, if not because the economy improved dramatically, because of the year-over-year comps. And so we expect every line of business to improve during the course of the year just like what we saw in October. And then you've got the overall volumes driven by that great special waste like it's been for the last three quarters. So that sort of the 10,000-foot view. The other thing that we've got going on is the investments that we started to make in customer-focused growth, the segmentation of our market areas. We're starting to see that take hold. We've talked about our medical waste initiatives, and we just had a large national hospital chain that was virtually 100% by a large competitor, we took about 30% of that business away. So we're on target to at least double the amount of medical waste we do. We're doing $20 million, $25 million. We expect to do about $50 million in 2011. And then when I talk about on the municipal side, we're going to make sure that we maintain the contracts. In the past, we've let some contracts go based strictly on our philosophy if we're going to raise prices everywhere every time. We're going to take a little harder look at the residentials line of business, and we're going to make sure that we stay at those contracts where we still get the good return on capital. So we're looking at that positive factors throughout the business. I think that will be born out once we see the spring come and you start to see normal seasonality kick in.", "Albert Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc.", "If I may pressure you a little bit on weather, why is this such an item being called out in greater emphasis from your side at least in my perspective, maybe relative to some of your competitors and other businesses in the market there. Is it exposure to certain markets that have been dramatically hit? Because historically, we've been reminded that this clears up after a couple of days as it relates to your...", "David Steiner", "Do you mean the weather? Yes, I mean, look, when you look -- I'm not sure about the other folks in our industry, but I follow the transportation industry fairly closely, and if you take a look over the last two or three weeks, you'll see that a number of transportation companies have brought down their earnings fairly dramatically because of the weather, more dramatically than we have. And basically, what happens is, as the folks up in New York know, commerce just shuts down, particularly when you have the type of snowstorms that we've been having along the East Coast and the Midwest. And when commerce shuts down, look, we move 15,000 tons a day out of New York City and when things shutdown, we move zero. And so some of that comes back, but not all of it comes back. And so the weather certainly has a dramatic effect on our business, and certainly, this weather this year has been as bad as we've ever seen. Now again, maybe what you didn't hear from the other companies is because they haven't closed their January books yet. I can't speak for the other companies. We've just closed our January books, and we were able to see that earnings were flat year-over-year and, generally, we'd expect them to be up $0.01 or $0.02. So we thought that was important for our shareholders to know and so we want to make sure to call it out.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley.", "Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley", "So how should we think about the upgrade that the waste energy facility is going forward and what's being done in Virginia? Are these costs that you've outlined for the year, are they truly onetime in nature during the first half of the year? Or are we likely to face more of these investments in 2012 and then periodically down the road?", "Robert Simpson", "This should finish it. The plants needed a fair amount of repair work when we moved in. And some of what we're upgrading could have been avoided had the plant been maintained better before we bought it. Some of it, though, was truly upgrades to make it operate more efficiently. It's more of the former than the latter. But once this is done, I think you'll see that, that piece is going to be much more normal operations.", "Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley", "And if I could try one more angle on the special waste, if we see this having been relatively strong, especially in the third quarter, maybe slowed a bit in the fourth quarter, when you talk about the strong pipeline going forward, is it reasonable to assume those volumes will be as strong as what we had in the September quarter? If you could just give us a feel for the magnitude.", "David Steiner", "And again, special waste is generally event-driven on that 35% that is non-contracted. And so it does bump around quite a bit. Like I said, the visibility that we have is generally just about a quarter out. And what we're seeing even during January where we had bad weather, what we're seeing is that volumes are continuing to move and that there are some fairly good-sized projects that we're seeing moving despite the bad weather. So again, are we going to see the same kind of great growth that we saw in 2011 and 2012? Well, obviously, the year-over-year comps will be a little bit more difficult, but we'd expect the dollar amount to be similar to 2010.", "Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley", "Lastly, in terms of outpacing the pricing objective of 50 to 100 bps above CPI, is that something that has the potential to get easier as the economy improves? In other words, are you increasingly optimistic about the ease with which you'll meet that pricing objective?", "David Steiner", "Yes, there is no doubt. I mean, I think you all follow the industry. And I think there's no doubt that we continue to be more aggressive than other folks in our industry. And so when you look at it -- and when I look at it, I look at it from sort of three angles. You got the CPI effect, which we can't do anything about, but that should improve as the economy improves. We just saw the wholesale prices come out and they were -- it's the only time in my life that I actually root for inflation is because we have the CPI adjusting contracts. And then we've got the other piece that we have to overcome, which is the fees and surcharges. I talked about those, those are about $50 million. Those will be $50 million negative. You can't really do much about those when the economy improves, although you should see things like the minimum ton per load and some of those other types of fees improve as the economy improves. And then you've got just the general price increases. When you look at GPIs, better economy is always going to be better for us because customers are more willing to accept price increases. But I think the important thing to remember about us is that we are moving away from price increases for price increases' sake. And what we're trying to do is to create that value proposition with our customers so that we can get both price and volume. I mean, that is for the first year, as for our pricing program, they were price-focused, and they were focused on price to the detriment of volume. And now that we're moved towards segmenting our customer base, we believe we can get both price and volume, and that's certainly our goal.", "Operator", "That was our final question. Does anyone have any closing comments?", "David Steiner", "Well, you know, obviously, what we've done in the fourth quarter of 2010, I believe, portends very well for us in 2011, and we look forward to meeting you all on the road with our new Director of Investor Relations, Ed Egle [ph], and we'll see you in the coming months.", "Robert Simpson", "And good luck to Jim.", "Operator", "Thank you for participating in today's Waste Management conference call.

Now I will turn the call over to Waste Management's CEO, David Steiner.", "David Steiner", "Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. During the second quarter, we earned $0.50 per diluted share. A number of things in the quarter went just as we expected. As previously discussed, we had about $0.06 of combined earnings per share headwinds from our waste energy operations, our growth initiatives and our cost reduction programs. ", "In the back half of the year, we expect these collective headwinds to abate and for our cost reduction efforts to begin to add to earnings. However, in the quarter, a few things did not go as we expected. We had a $0.04 reduction in earnings per share from increased maintenance from repair costs, legal items and risk management. The legal and risk management items are second quarter issues but the maintenance increase is primarily due to higher commodity prices. So we'll likely see higher maintenance costs in the back half of the year. ", "Our revenue growth from yield was slightly below expectations for the quarter and our revenue growth from volume was lower than our expectations. With respect to yield, we're taking immediate and significant pricing actions to increase our yield. With respect to volumes, we continue to move forward with our customer focused growth initiatives, and the transaction that we announced today to purchase Oakleaf will certainly accelerate those efforts. ", "We're pleased that during the second quarter, revenue increased by $189 million or 6% from the prior-year quarter. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of positive year-over-year revenue comparison. Higher commodity prices, improved recycling volumes, acquisitions and year-over-year yield increases contributed to the revenue growth. While internal revenue growth from yield continues to provide positive revenue growth, we're not satisfied with the results for the second quarter. Internal revenue growth from yield and our collection and disposal operations was 1.6% in the quarter and 2.2% year-to-date through June 30. ", "The combined internal revenue growth from yield in the industrial, commercial and residential lines of our collection business was 2% in the second quarter. Commercial and industrial yields were 3.2% and 1.3%, respectively. Yield in our residential line of business was 0.9%. At the beginning of the year, we noted that the residential line of business was becoming more competitive. Local, regional and national companies have become more aggressive on price. Municipalities are also looking for price concessions, so although yield remains positive, we do not expect significant increases in the residential yield. ", "Our price increases to customers were right on plan, but mix issues had about 60 to 80 basis points of negative effect on yield in the quarter, which is much higher than we've seen in the recent past. The mix issues were most common in our southern group, where, for example, in our franchise markets, we saw a dramatic shift in mix from higher-priced permanent roll-off to a lower-priced temporary roll-off. So looking at yield without mix, we would have been over 2% yield. Our pricing actions in the second half of the year should add about 80 to 100 basis points to yield, of course, offset by any continuing mix issues. ", "Another factor affecting our yield has been rollbacks of our price increases. In our commercial line of business, we implemented significant price increases to our customers in the 6% to 7% range. This level of price increase has been the norm over the last 5 years of Waste Management. Local haulers often offer new business prices substantially below our prices. But lately, we've seen our regional and national competitors aggressively reduce prices to obtain volumes. We had to take action to retain profitable customers. ", "And in the second quarter, we saw the highest level of price rollbacks since prior 2004. But the bottom line earnings benefit of increasing our yield continues to exceed earnings benefit you can get from purchasing volumes at low prices. So we will continue to maintain our pricing discipline even in the face of aggressive discounting by our competitors. Despite these pricing pressures, we maintained customer churn at about 10% in the second quarter, a 60 basis point improvement from the same quarter in the prior year. On the landfill yield front, all of the waste streams had positive revenue growth from yield during the second quarter, continuing the trend that we saw in the first quarter. ", "On the volume side of the business, internal revenue growth from volume declined 1.7% in the quarter, which is flat compared to the first quarter of 2011. If you exclude the volumes associated with the Gulf Coast cleanup efforts in 2010, volume would have declined 1.1% in the quarter. Although we saw a good seasonal uptick in volumes in the first few weeks of April, volumes had a soft patch in May and June, mirroring the dip in the U.S. economy. Our commercial collection line of business saw a year-over-year volume decline of 4.9% and the residential line of business saw a 4.2% decline year-over-year. Both of these collection lines improved sequentially from the first quarter. Industrial volumes declined by 3.6% on a year-over-year basis.", "In the landfill side of the business, second quarter 2011 internal revenue growth from volume improved by 1.1% compared to the second quarter of 2010. Internal revenue growth from volume for special waste was positive 8.1% year-over-year. This is an increase sequentially from the positive 2.9% internal revenue growth from volumes that we saw in the first quarter. And we still see strength in the pipeline for special waste volumes.", "C&D volumes declined 7.8% year-over-year and MSW internal revenue growth from volumes was negative 7.5% year-over-year. ", "Income from operations in the collection line of business improved slightly during the second quarter when compared to the same quarter last year. We increased our income from operations despite the declining volumes and increasing cost inflation in the price of tires, lubricants and steel parts. These maintenance-related costs have risen between 10% and 40% from the same quarter of 2010, reflecting the worldwide increase in commodity prices.", "As we expected, income from operations in our waste-to-energy line of business declined in the second quarter compared to the second quarter of 2010 by $0.02. The expiration of a long-term electric power capacity agreement in South Florida had a negative $6.6 million effect in the quarter. Also affecting the decline were upgrades to our acquired facility in Virginia and increased costs for fuel and chemical usage.", "For the rest of 2011, we expect the third and fourth quarter to be flat year-over-year for our waste-to-energy business and for earnings to begin to increase in the first quarter of 2012.", "Turning to our recycling business, increased commodity prices and volume contributed about $0.03 of positive year-over-year earnings per diluted share in the second quarter of 2011, which is similar to the first quarter. Commodity prices have increased approximately 25% when compared with the same quarter last year. If prices continue to remain strong, we expect to see about a $0.03 to $0.04 benefit for the second half of the year. ", "With respect to solid waste volumes, we certainly expect to see stronger seasonal improvement during the second quarter. Landfill volumes have remained positive while the collection volumes have continued to show weakness. One positive in our collection business is that is service increases have exceeded decreases for the second consecutive quarter. Of course, in the third and fourth quarter, we'll have to overcome the increase in volume that we saw last year from the Gulf Coast cleanup, which added about 1.7% to volumes in the third quarter and about 0.8% in the fourth quarter. ", "Volumes looked slightly better in July. But given our weak first half volumes, we now expect to see volumes in the negative 1.5% to negative 2.5% range for the full year. In response to the current business environment and our outlook for volumes, we've instituted yield improvement and cost containment plans. ", "From a yield point of view, in order to strengthen our pricing in the second half of 2011, we've increased our environmental fee and accelerated our price increase programs. By doing this, we expect to be able to achieve our goal of 2% yield for the full year. We've also implemented a cost containment program to rein in on increasing costs. This program includes reducing travel and entertainment, eliminating discretionary spending and eliminating certain positions. We estimate that controlling these costs will add approximately $30 million to $40 million of income from operations when compared with the third and fourth quarters of 2010. ", "Of course, we also realize that you have to spend some short-term money to get long-term benefits. And we will continue to invest in system upgrades, our innovation and optimization programs and customer-focused growth. We believe that incurring these costs today will ensure that we're a stronger company in the future. But we also have to be mindful of the present conditions and cut costs wherever we can. ", "For the remainder of the year, we expect recycling commodity prices to remain strong and for our waste-to-energy operations to achieve earnings similar to 2010 second half earnings. Our cost programs and growth initiatives will continue to progress but we expect to see weaker volumes in the second half than we originally planned. Consequently, we now project full year adjusted earnings of between $2.14 and $2.18 per diluted share. ", "Finally, today I'm excited to announce the acquisition of Oakleaf, the largest waste broker in the United States, with annualized revenues of about $580 million. This acquisition provides us an opportunity to add a significant amount of collection and disposal volumes through our systems. ", "In our discussions with Oakleaf, we also recognize that they have some compelling value propositions that they can provide to customers, particularly in the commercial property and food and retail segments. It's similar to what we're doing in those segments through our customer-focused growth efforts. We expect that their excellent sales, management and service teams will greatly increase our penetration in those markets by providing value-added environmental solutions to customers. ", "At the same time, we believe we'll be able to benefit both their current customers and their extensive vendor hauler network to create a win-win situation. The Oakleaf transaction provides great value and great opportunities for waste management. We look forward to our new partnership and we welcome the Oakleaf team to Waste Management. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.", "Robert Simpson", "Thank you, David. I will begin by discussing operating costs. These costs increased by $144 million in the second quarter to 63.9% of revenue. The biggest contributor was cost of goods sold, which increased $95 million in the quarter, mainly because of rebates due to higher recycling commodity prices and volumes. Note that these higher commodity prices and volumes, net of rebates, resulted in an increase in our earnings per diluted share from our recycling operations of approximately $0.03 in the quarter.", "Direct fuel costs increased approximately $39 million, primarily because of a 33% increase in price per gallon of diesel fuel. Subcontractor costs increased $6 million in the quarter, primarily relating to the increased fuel costs at our transfer operations. In the second quarter, fuel surcharge revenue continued to offset the increased cost of direct fuel and fuel increases included in subcontractor costs. ", "Maintenance costs increased $17 million, primarily related to the higher costs for parts and supply, tires and lubricants at our collection and landfill operations. As David said, we have seen prices for these items increased between 10% and 40% year-over-year, generally in line with prior commodity prices.", "Operating expenses increased $24 million due to acquisitions made within the last 12 months. And foreign currency translation for our Canadian operations accounted for an increase in operating costs of approximately $8 million. ", "SG&A costs increased $37 million year-over-year and, as a percentage of revenue, increased 50 basis points to 11.4%. The increased costs in SG&A primarily relate to our strategic growth plans and our cost reduction initiatives and are in line with what we discussed on our previous conference calls this year. ", "Our growth initiatives, which include medical waste and Bagster had a negative $0.03 per diluted share impact on the quarter. When we gave guidance for the year, we described the initiatives to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in areas like procurement, routing and logistics and the centralization of certain functions. We spent approximately $19 million on these initiatives in the second quarter, consistent with our expectation. ", "We are now starting to see positive traction in procurement where we have $5 billion in spend that we can go after. Given the positive results that we have seen late in the second quarter, we feel confident that we will see the benefits in the third and fourth quarters that will more than offset the full year cost of these initiatives. We also expect that in the second half of 2011, the consulting costs for these initiatives will decline by $22 million. The remaining SG&A costs associated with these initiatives will support future revenue growth and will reduce operating expenses.", "Interest expense for the second quarter increased $3 million compared with the prior year. On June 30, 2011, our weighted average cost of debt was 5.4% and our debt-to-total-capital ratio for the quarter was 57.7%, consistent with our target ratio of about 60%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 18% at the end of the quarter. ", "During the second quarter, we amended our $2 billion revolving credit facility, significantly reducing the cost of the facility and extending its term to May 2016. The credit markets had improved significantly since we executed our agreement in June 2010 and we view this as an opportunity to meaningfully reduce our future interest cost. We estimate that we should save approximately $5 million in interest expense during the second half of 2011.", "Our income tax rate, as reported for the second quarter of 2011, was 34.5%. For 2011, we expect the recurring effective tax rate to be approximately 35%.", "Turning to cash flow. Second quarter 2011 net cash provided by operating activities was $478 million. This was flat compared to the second quarter of 2010. Our capital expenditures for the second quarter were $280 million, $60 million higher than the second quarter of 2010 and consistent with our plan to increase capital expenditures in 2011. We still anticipate spending between $1.35 billion and $1.45 billion on capital expenditures during 2011. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $206 million, which was $69 million less than the prior-year quarter, largely due to an increase in capital expenditures of $60 million. We still expect free cash flow for 2011 of about $1.25 billion.", "In the second quarter of 2011, we paid $161 million in dividends and we repurchased $105 million of our common stock, continuing our long-standing emphasis on returning cash to our shareholders. We also completed approximately $58 million in business acquisitions.", "Now, we believe that the actions we are taking to grow and to optimize our operations, including the acquisition of Oakleaf, are the right actions. And with the help of our employees, the best in the business, we will begin to see the results of those actions in the second half of this year and into 2012. And with that, Nicole, let's open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "The first question is just surrounding pricing. Maybe if you could give some color. Is the price discounting you're seeing from regionals broad-based? Or are you seeing that more in certain markets? And then what gives you confidence that the 80 bps to 100 bps of price actions that you're taking are going to materialize? Because it seems like the mix are towards temporary roll-off. It's not changing. It seems like the rollbacks likely are not changing and it seems like we're not expecting any incremental volume upticks here, which were -- maybe help pricing. If you could just add some color there.", "David Steiner", "Sure, and I think you're exactly right, Hamzah. The mix issues, you know, they were more dramatic at 60 to 80 basis points this quarter than they've been in the past. And frankly, we don't see those offsetting. And so what we need to do is we'll get that 80 to 100 basis points of benefit from the actions we're taking. And hopefully, that more than offsets the mix issues. Now obviously, if the mix issues get worse in the back half of the year and you can't predict the mix, it's a problem. If they were to get worse in the back half of the year, obviously, that would have more of an effect on that 100 basis point improvement. The first part of the question is interesting. I think everybody recognizes that we've generally been the price leader in the markets that we serve. And in the past, what we've seen is that the regional and national competitors that basically drafted off of our price actions and all the rises, all the tides lifted the rising boats. But what we've always seen sort of pockets of places where I would say there wasn't as much pricing discipline. Over the last couple of quarters, what we've seen is that those pockets have expanded to where it looks to us like it's virtually in every one of our markets that we're seeing folks that aren't drafting on our pricing actions anymore. They're taking actions that are designed more to get volume than to draft on our pricing actions, and that's become pretty widespread throughout our markets, obviously, as the economy hasn't improved. Now the reality is that you get -- you can never get as much benefit from volume as you can from pricing. All the pricing falls to the bottom line but the volume doesn't. And so we continue to recognize that the trade-off is positive. But the trade-off is positive. We've been raising prices on our current customer base where we've seen the deterioration. Again, as you pointed out, it's frankly in the pricing rollbacks in order to maintain our customers that are under attack and in the mix, which, obviously, we don't have any control over. So if we see sort of the 20 to 40 basis points of mix in the back half of the year offset by the 80 basis points to 100 basis points of pricing action, that's how you get back to our 2% yield.", "Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Okay. And then just on the Oakleaf transaction. What kind of synergies are you targeting? Assuming that $80 million number is all synergies, and what buckets do you think those will come from? And does this transaction change any kind of your return of cash to shareowners? How should we think about that?", "David Steiner", "Yes, it shouldn't affect the return of our cash to the shareholders. And from a synergy point of view, certainly, there are synergies that will be obtained in the combination. But the primary driver of value here is the ability to manage the waste volumes that they're collecting from the customers. And so very little of the benefit comes from synergies. The primary driver of value here will be managing that network.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Levine with JPMorgan.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "So looking for maybe a little bit more color on the pricing subject. It's a pretty big shift. It seems like within a relatively short period of time. So just maybe if you can provide a little bit more color on the types. I mean it seems regionally you're seeing more competition everywhere. But is it certain types of markets? Is it the urban markets? Or is it the more or less populated regions? Is it more within particular lines of business where you're starting to see competition pick-up? Any additional color there would be helpful.", "David Steiner", "Yes. And Scott, like I said before, the interesting thing that's happened over the last couple of quarters is that it has become more widespread throughout the business units. It started out at the beginning of the year. We recognized that there was going to be some pretty aggressive action in big residential contracts and we took account of that in our front year guidance. But it has spread to the roll-off in the commercial lines. We just got through in the last 2 weeks going through all 25 of our geographic areas to look at their market business strategy for the next 4 years. And for the first time since I've been meeting with these folks on a quarterly basis, it was virtually every market that said they're seeing very aggressive pricing action spreading, starting out, obviously, in the residential line of business but now spreading to the commercial and the industrial line. And that's why you see our price rollbacks growing. So in other words, I think the whole point of the pricing is a few things. First off, we're not going to back off on our price increases because the trade-off is still positive, but we are seeing more reductions from rollbacks, which is obviously competitively driven. And then we got this mix issue that, quite frankly, we didn't see coming in the beginning part of the year. You can't predict the mix. And it really hit us hard in the second quarter. We expect it to abate a little bit but we still expect to see some of that in the third and fourth quarters.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Follow-up. I think you mentioned some changes recently to the senior leadership team. I was hoping you might be able to provide some color on that and maybe an update with regard to the CFO search.", "David Steiner", "When I look at the senior leadership team and the composition of the senior leadership team, what we were trying to do was to align the senior leadership team around our primary focuses. Right now, that is all about our customer focus, growth efforts and our innovation and optimization efforts. And I wanted to get the team aligned around that. Bringing Jim Trevathan in from the field, I think, was something that we needed in order to make sure that we could drive both of those into the field. I mean those are the 2 biggest things we're working on, and I needed someone with a depth of experience and with field credibility to be able to drive those big programs throughout the company. So I think Jim will be a tremendous benefit there. On the CFO search, as you all know, it will be very difficult to replace Bob, but we are well on the way in our search. And we fully expect that by the time he marches out the door on September 30, we'll have his replacement in the chair.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Fisher with Raymond James.", "William Fisher - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "A couple of things. One on the $80 million of operating income improvement you're targeting. Is that in the second half versus the first half? Or is that kind of a year-over-year thing?", "David Steiner", "That is the second half versus the first half.", "William Fisher - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And on that, you kind of roughly did -- I know it's coming from both operating improvements and SG&A, but is there -- should the SG&A, I think Bob highlighted some numbers, should that just drop sequentially in kind of a half-half split, if you will, between those 2 things?", "Robert Simpson", "I think what you'll see is the SG&A will still be up year-over-year. It won't be up as much as we had planned from the beginning. But the initiatives, the customer-focused growth initiatives and the innovation and business optimization initiatives, are going to continue. And they're incremental to what we were spending last year. So what we've done is we've been sourced a lot of the consulting work and won't be needing that anymore. And we produced ads in a number of places and in a number of functions. So I think that it will -- I expect SG&A for the year to be a little under 12% of revenue.", "William Fisher - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "And on Oakleaf, is one of the benefits next year as well your -- to the extent another hauler in a local market serving a national account, and you have hauling obviously there, you can internalize that and then bring that collection in-house, if you will?", "David Steiner", "Yes, there's really 2 approaches that will take in every market. The obvious one is exactly that. But when you think about it, just to use an example, let's assume that a hauler has $100,000 of Oakleaf business in a particular market and that's 10% of their revenue. If $100,000 is 10% of their revenue, that means they have $1 million of total revenue, right? And that also means that about 30% to 40% of that $1 million is disposal costs for them. So they've got $300,000 to $400,000 of disposal costs on their $1 million of revenue, right? That's 3x to 4x the amount of revenue that Oakleaf has in that market, that $100,000. So when you think about it, you can get 3x to 4x the revenue if you're able to get all of their disposal volumes in a line of business that has about double the margins of the collection line of business. So if we're able to work with those haulers to get them to bring all of their volumes to our disposal and recycling facilities, we actually do a lot better than if we take over that business on the truck. We can do better on the order of magnitudes. So you're getting 3x to 4x the revenue in a line of business that probably has double the margin. So you're getting 6x to 8x more benefit if you can add that hauler, bring their volumes to your landfill network and your recycling network. And so we're going to work with those local haulers to actually keep them in place. But look, if we can provide better disposal solutions for them, that become a win for them and a win for us", "William Fisher - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "And then just real quickly, that 80 to 100 basis point on price you're trying to get, would you say half of that's from that environmental fee increase? Or how do you think about that?", "David Steiner", "That's about right. It's about half -- a little bit more than half of the environmental fee, and then the rest from accelerating price increases into the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities.", "Albert Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc.", "I want to press a little bit on this mix issue and in particular, what changed from sort of the April call to today or to adjusting guidance down what seems like a significant number in a very short period of time.", "David Steiner", "Yes. And frankly, we were a little bit surprised by it. When you look at the first quarter, we had a slight negative for mix. In the second quarter, that went to $19.5 million, and so it was a pretty dramatic shift pretty quickly. And most of that occurred in our southern group. So for example, in South Florida, we have franchise business. And in the franchise markets, our permanent roll-off is actually higher priced than our temporary roll-off, a little different than most of our other markets. But the permanent roll-off business has started in Florida, has started to feel the heat from the economy over the last few years. But actually, there was a pretty good tick-up in temporary businesses. So you had a mix in the roll-off line that went from higher-priced to lower-priced volumes. You've also had some residential contracts throughout the country where, in order to maintain or extend those contracts, we'll go in and offer a recycling service. So if you are doing a solid waste home at $12 a home and you go in and you do recycling at $2 a home, you've made a good business decision. But your yield looks like it's going down. And then we've got a lot of special waste, as you know, for the last few years and special waste is always interesting. The example I use is if you have a landfill where you are bringing in waste from a long distance, you might charge $18 at a whole but you charge $50 for transportation. But then if the volumes come in from closer, you might charge $20 at the whole with no transportation. So you're actually making a great business decision. You're making more money but it looks like your price has gone down because of the mix of volumes. And so I think with the increase in special waste, with the change in South Florida, with the change with some of the residential contracts and then with our normal churn, we saw that hit us a lot harder in the second quarter than we've seen in the past.", "Albert Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc.", "David, if I looked at the 1.5% to 2.5% decline and then back out the so-called large special waste item, that being in the gulf, what's the decline in the business now? Because you were basically suggesting flat heading into this sprint, but there's obviously these items you've talked about.", "David Steiner", "Yes. When we look at volumes, really, what you're seeing -- I think what we're seeing in volumes mirrors the U.S. economy, which is we just aren't seeing the West and the South come back, work through their housing problems as fast as we expected. And then -- so what we've seen in the last few quarters is that the Midwest and the East have actually been doing fairly well. The South and the West haven't been doing so well. And then this quarter, what you saw was that the West and the South continued to have negative volumes. But you also saw in May and June, you saw even some softness in the Midwest and the East, which, I think, is probably driven by the same effects, the same factors that you saw on the national economy. So what we're seeing is that volumes continue to remain stubbornly low. We've talked about it since the beginning of the downturn, which is what you'll see, I believe, is when you see the commercial volumes start to turn is when you'll see the volumes turn for us. And we just haven't seen that happen yet.", "Albert Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc.", "Okay. And then if I may try to bridge or do the waterfall from the prior EPS guidance to the current, which, I guess, excludes any consideration of the Oakleaf, it looks like at midpoint there's an $0.11 drop to the guidance. And so I was wondering, if someone could provide the buckets of which you would associate that $0.11 drop, so 50% volume, 3% of it's price, I mean what's the...", "Robert Simpson", "I would tell you that the drop is volume. That drop in volume, Al, is offset by the actions we're taking on the cost side. Remember, the actions we're taking on the yield side ought to just get us back to where our guidance was at the beginning of the year. And if the actions that we're taking on the cost side plus a little bit of improvement in our outlook for recycling commodity prices and recycling volumes.", "David Steiner", "And I would tell you that I think that's exactly right. The primary change is the volumes. The secondary change has been the price rollbacks. I mean we did not go into the year expecting to see the level of price rollbacks we have. Obviously, it's a more competitive market out there than we had anticipated. And I think that makes sense given where the volumes are. We expected there to be a little bit of return to the volume, which obviously takes a little bit of the pressure off of both local, regional and national players to lower price. I think as they've seen the volumes continue to remain weak, they've gotten more aggressive on price. And as I keep saying and saying and saying, and I'll continue to say, we're not going to take those actions but we're going to have to respond to those actions by maintaining customers through price rollbacks.", "Albert Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc.", "Structurally, don't expect any change in the price strategy, continue to be firm on that. But as a result of that, we should expect some net churn and higher churn in volume?", "Robert Simpson", "That is a result of that. I would say it's just what the volumes were with the economy this way.", "David Steiner", "And what it comes down to, I mean the churn rate in the quarter was actually slightly improved. But the problem is that we have to rollback prices to maintain those customers. So I don't think -- look, we have a choice. When every customer calls in and says they got a lower price from someone in the competition, we have two choices: let them go or maintain them by reducing their price as little as we can by offering them other services and things like that. But we need to maintain those customers. So at the same time, we've got a pricing strategy that says we're going to continue exactly as we've been in the past, getting those 6% to 7% price increases and maintaining our new business pricing discipline, but we're going to have to be more aggressive to maintain customers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Wunderlich Securities.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "1Q '10, you had a price scenario that I'm going to try and possibly equate to what we're seeing in 2Q in the sense of it doesn't live up to your expectations. And you fairly quickly turned around to the system and said, fix it. And they did and we saw a rapid change in 2Q. Can you compare those 2 to us on the context of that you're dealing with and the probability of that ability to have that quick turn?", "David Steiner", "Yes, I think -- actually, that's a great question, Michael. And that's what we've been spending a lot of time. I would say we've been spending most of our time over the last probably 3 weeks working on. And I think you are exactly right. The parallel is very clear. The only difference is -- and so the organization will get it done. I don't have any doubt about that. We've already got the environmental fee rolling out. We've got the acceleration of our price increases in the pipeline. So the organization will respond. I don't have any doubt about that. The difference that we've got between this year and that year, because what you saw was we dropped below 1% and then we immediately snapped back well above 2%, the only difference you have between now and then is this mix issue, right? I mean we didn't have the 60 to 80 basis points of mix headwind. And again, mix doesn't necessarily reduce your bottom line earnings. In my examples, you're actually making more money but it looks like your yield is going down. And so you would see exactly the same snapback if it weren't for these mix issues. And the way we're looking at the mix issues right now, we're expecting them to continue in the back half of the year. So I think the corollary is identical. As soon as we see deterioration, we take action to do something about it and we intend to maintain that discipline.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "Okay. And so another side of that question is, you're being more proactive about defending long-standing businesses as opposed...", "David Steiner", "Right.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "Okay. But that in itself is not necessarily a bad thing either because the alternative is to replace it without being too long about this. I mean if you had a customer churn at 10%, then you're talking about having customers for 10 years. So if you've held on to somebody for 10 years and you put him in at $3 a yard 10 years ago but raised prices 6% year-over-year, you're somewhere in the $5 or $6 a yard now and the competitor's somewhere between $3 and $5 to try and pick it off.", "David Steiner", "You're exactly right. And when we look at it, we look at new business pricing, lost business pricing, the business that we look at from a lost business pricing point of view, the business that we have is spectacular business. It's way above what our competition is charging for new business. And so the smart thing to do is to maintain those customers because you don't have the -- obviously, you don't have the acquisition cost for those customers but you also have those customers already at great rates. And so you've hit the nail right on the head. The problem is that we have to spend our efforts defending the price, and we're going to do that. And I would hope that, as folks recognize, that we're not going to let go of customers as readily as we have in the past, that they'll realize that, for their own company, they're going to start a debt spiral that probably doesn't end where they want it to end.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "All right. And then you've highlighted Florida very specifically. And unfortunately, there's 3 relatively sizable -- between Advanced Choice and Waste Pro, they're noted for being the price draggers in Florida. But the other thing is such -- I can see where maybe the -- that's why your problems -- but let me understand mix. So what I'm basically hearing is that bankruptcies are increasing or basically people going out of business that used to be permanent. But the temporary would suggest that there's some economic recovery recurring as well.", "David Steiner", "I think in South Florida, I'm not sure if I call it an economic recovery. It's a dead cat bounce, right? I mean the roll-off volumes went down so dramatically that it's pretty easy for them to grow, right? And so you've actually seen a little bit of growth in the temporary business but you've seen shrinkage in the permanent business.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "All right. And then on the free cash flow side, to hit the goal for the rest of the year, you've done just under $500 million, if I brought math correctly, for the first half. That means you have to do 750-ish in the second half. And noting this $80 million that you're going to capture in savings between the yield and cost cuts, so that would suggest to me the run rate was 670 going in. That seems stronger than the normal. It's 55, 2nd half, 45, 1st half mix of your free cash.", "Robert Simpson", "It's like it will be more like last year where we have stronger free cash flow in the second half of the year than we had previously, and I think that's what we're expecting to see.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "But the degree of that strength would suggest that it's not great news to be able to tell everybody that you're lowering guidance. I get all that. But reading through it, the degree of that strength would say that if I roll into '12, I'm going to be up in free cash.", "Robert Simpson", "In '12?", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "To '12, 2012.", "Robert Simpson", "But we haven't given guidance on that yet. But Michael, I don't know why that wouldn't be true.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "Right. Just following the logic on this. The 2012, that's got to be higher than 1.25 based on what you're describing how this plays out in the second half.", "Robert Simpson", "Well, I think that's right. I mean we're taking a lot of steps. We're paying the price in SG&A now to grow our business, to reduce our costs. And we should see the benefits of those, some of it in the second half of this year but accelerating into 2012 and later years.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "Okay. So not to press the fine point, where's the Board's tolerance or patience with regards to the show me this is really happening?", "David Steiner", "Yes, Michael, it's interesting because obviously, you have to spend money to make money. And we had a lot of opportunities to get long-term benefits. We identified it at the beginning of the year. We knew we had to spend money in order to get those benefits. I mean that's just the nature of the beast. But we also expected volumes to bounce back. I mean, look, the reality is that these dollars that we're spending to benefit our future wouldn't even be recognized if we were showing volume growth and continuing to get 2%-plus yield. It wouldn't be affecting our numbers whatsoever. We happen to be spending money for the future in the teeth of volumes and price that aren't as strong as we thought they would be. And so you have 2 choices, right? You either say, okay, we're going to cut the spending because we're not seeing the volumes with price come in, or you say, we're going to continue to do what we think is the best thing for the long term of this company. And you spend despite the fact that you\u2019re seeing -- because you know you are going to get the future benefit and you keep spending despite the fact that it's been a tough year. I said it in my script, it's a tough balance to do for the long term and the short term. But we're going to spend to benefit the long term. But on the other hand, we're also going to go to our organization and say, look, we've got to find everywhere we can to cut out costs other than the investment in the future. And so when you talk about a Board, our Board is obviously a long-term thinking Board. We're a long-term thinking management team. And so I think they have -- as long as they're seeing the progress, I think they've got the right amount of patience.", "Robert Simpson", "I think they recognize that the journey is not a straight line.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "Okay. And clearly, they targeted an $80 million number. You can't tell the market to not actually deliver on it. So you must have an awful lot of visibility on that number.", "David Steiner", "Well, as we said, a good part of that is from pricing actions, and we've already done that. Now if we had to roll that back dramatically, but we built into the plan what we think is a reasonable amount of rollback of that, and so that could affect it. And on the cost side, we've already taken a lot of the action to pull those costs down. So yes, we're pretty caught confident there.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "All right. And then lastly, this isn't public records. So the Woodlands, Texas municipal bid, you guys lowered the price pretty significantly to keep it. I mean it was $12.50 a home and now you're at $9. So I mean that seems pretty -- is it taking that kind of change to be able to keep business?", "David Steiner", "Yes, it's a different -- we also had a different level of different service in there, right? And so I think that's a great point. That's a place where it looks like we are reducing price, but basically what we did was we went in with different service levels and we actually do just as well on that contract than we did at the higher price. And so it's one of those actions that is a good business decision but that also that makes it look like you're dropping price.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Corey Greendale with First Analysis.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corporation", "First question is, Bob, I think you commented that you think that increasing the yield level won't hit volumes. Could you just square that with the idea that right now you're going to rollback price more? And if it's not going to hit volumes, why not in for 2.5 points of price instead of 2 points?", "Robert Simpson", "Yes, I think what I was saying, Corey, is not yet in what I've -- first of all, I think we've shown over time that raising prices hasn't really impacted our churn rate. Our churns have been between 9 and 11, ever since I got here 12 years ago. It stayed in that range and it's still in that range now. So the impact of raising prices hasn't been a significant impact in how our volumes have performed. Now we have increased rollbacks in the second quarter and that maybe indicate a higher level of competition. But we're still going to get 2% yield even with a little bit higher level of rollbacks. We think the real driver of the volumes isn't the price increases. It's the economy and where businesses are right now.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corporation", "Okay. And David, I think you said the roll-off, relative temporary roll-off strength was a dead cat bound to that. I think that's right. Assuming the cat doesn't keep bouncing indefinitely. Wouldn't that suggest that back half of the year, what you're going to see probably is more out and out weakness versus the mix issue?", "David Steiner", "Yes, from a volume perspective -- Corey, we just haven't seen -- and it's actually very interesting to watch our volume reports because what you'll see is a couple of weeks where you start to think that you're turning the corner and we've actually had a couple of weeks where our volumes were not only above 2010 volumes but we've done a roll-off in the disposal side. But they're not only above 2010 volumes, but they've been above 2009 volumes. And then all of a sudden, they've flattened out. And then on the commercial side, we just haven't seen -- unfortunately, I think that cat's been dead for a while and we just haven't seen any bounce on the commercial side. And that, to me, is indicative of the fact that there's not a lot of strength on the consumer side of the United States economy. There's strength on the manufacturing side. There's strength on the server-side. But right now, there's not a lot of strength on the consumer side.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corporation", "Okay. And could you just give your thoughts on kind of the coordination between you all in Houston and the field in terms of some of the price rollbacks that you're seeing? Is that completely consistent with what you would have expected in Houston and with what you would have advocated for? Or would you say that the field has maybe been a little bit more aggressive in rolling back price to keep volumes in than you would have liked and you're looking to change that?", "David Steiner", "No, I think actually, they're doing a good job. I mean again, it comes down to the question of how fast could you add customers to replace the customers that you let leave you and at what rate are they leaving you. And when they're leaving us at the highest rate that we've seen from a rate per yard, rate per pull on the industrial site, when they're leaving us at the highest rates we've seen in a number of years, those are the types of customers -- not the highest rates in the volume point of view but the highest rates from a price per yard and price per pull point of view, those are customers that you don't want to lose. And then you've got to go out and acquire new customers to replace them if you want to maintain your volume. And that cost you some money. And in this environment, that's not an easy thing to do either without lowering your price. So it's the right strategy for us. Can we do better? Yes, we can do better. We can save them at higher prices, and we've got our folks focused on doing that. But it's the right business decision to make and it's one that we've got to continue to make.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corporation", "Okay. And then a couple of questions on Oakleaf. I presume it's a relatively capital light model. But can you just give us some sense of what their CapEx is?", "David Steiner", "Yes, their CapEx is fairly low. Obviously, for us, we've got -- as I said before, we've got sort of the 2 business models. We've got the 1 business model where we will have to go in and become the hauler. But our preferred method would be to work with the vendor network to allow them to offer other services that we have, whether it's recycling, LampTracker, other types of services, and then able to offer disposal and recycling services to them across their business line. That's our preferred method. If we go in a market where we go about that method, obviously, there's no additional capital because the containers will stay in place. If we aren't to work out those types of arrangements with the vendor network, then we're going to have to go and replace them and spend some capital. But we don't see that. As I recall, Bob, that was sort of in the $10 million to $15 million on the high end that we have to spend in capital in the back half of the year. And again, if we can work with the vendor network in a win-win manner, we won't even have to spend that.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corporation", "Okay.  And could you just revisit -- I think in answer to the previous question, you were talking about being able to influence the people in the network to use your disposal. Can you just elaborate on that? And what is it about owning Oakleaf that makes that a more easier process than it would have been discussing that with those people when you didn't own Oakleaf?", "David Steiner", "Yes, well, it makes it easier because we now control a big portion of their collection business, right? I mean in the example I used, if 10% of their business is Oakleaf business, we would prefer to leave that in place and work out an arrangement with the vendor hauler where they bring us recycling volumes and disposal volumes at a level that's cost neutral or maybe even cost beneficial to them. So that's a huge win for them. It's a huge win for us. The reason why we're able to do that, that we aren't able to do now is we don't have -- 10% of their business in that market isn't controlled by Waste Management. As of today, it is. And so if you want to maintain that business, then we've got to look at the other parts of our business relationship to make it a win-win. It's not a win for Waste Management if one of our vendor haulers just simply maintains that $100,000 of business in the market and we do nothing. That is not a win for Waste Management. There's only 2 ways we can win: one, put it in on the back of our trucks and bring it in to our landfill. But then we only get that 10% of the business. If we can get 100% of their volumes into our disposal network, that's a huge win for us. And if we can do it at a cost-neutral, even a cost-beneficial number to the vendor hauler, it's a win for them. And so it's a bigger win for us and a good win for them, and we see that as positive for everyone.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corporation", "Okay. I was just going to ask when that transaction is going to close?", "David Steiner", "Closed today.", "Operator", "That is all the time we have for questions today. Are there any closing remarks?", "David Steiner", "Yes, what I'd like to say is a couple of things. Obviously, we're not happy with what happened in our second quarter. And hopefully, what you've heard today is that we're going to take actions to get this thing right. But we're not going to do that by sacrificing the future. And then I think a couple of other things. On the Oakleaf transaction, I think we'd be remiss if we didn't mention the amazing work that our team did putting this together. We've been in discussions with them for quite a long time but we got into some very serious discussions over the last month or so. ", "And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention John Stein [ph], our legal team and Joe Cassin and Buddy West and Shawn Hill in our finance group and Scott Stadelman in the sales department and tons of other people that have been working night and day to get this deal done. It was a phenomenal job by them. This is going to be a great opportunity for Waste Management. It's also going to be a great opportunity for the folks at Oakleaf. So we're really looking forward to getting to know our new partner. And I can promise you, we'll be meeting with them regularly to let them know what's going on, as we will with the vendor hauler network. ", "And then finally, I wanted to say this is actually Bob's last quarterly conference call. And from my point of view, we've been together now for about 7 years. Bob's been a great business partner, but he's a better friend than a business partner. And we will certainly all miss his sage advice as he wanders off to retire to his beloved Kingwood. So Bob, congratulations on the retirement. And I'm sure I'll be visiting your house often.", "Robert Simpson", "Please come out.", "David Steiner", "Thank you, all.", "Robert Simpson", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you for participating in today's Waste Management Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call.

We took a lot of costs out in the quarter, and we will continue to attack costs. However, we'll also continue to focus on our long-term cost and revenue initiatives, because in a slow growth environment, those initiatives will help to drive earnings improvement.", "Revenue for the third quarter increased by $181 million or 5.6% from the prior year period. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of positive year-over-year revenue comparison. We achieved this despite the third quarter of 2010 having benefited significantly from the Gulf Coast cleanup effort. Excluding Gulf Coast volumes from the comparison, volumes would have been down only 0.3%, which was the best performance we've seen in years. Higher commodity prices, improved recycling volumes, acquisitions, year-over-year internal revenue growth from yield and surcharge increases all contributed to the revenue growth. ", "Internal revenue from growth from yield on our collection and disposal operations was 1.6% in the quarter and is at 2% year-to-date through September 30. The quarter's result is consistent with our results in the second quarter of 2011, demonstrating our continued pricing discipline. The combined internal revenue growth from yield at the industrial, commercial and residential lines of our collection business was 2.1% in the third quarter. Commercial and industrial yields were 3% and 2.2%, respectively. IRG from yield in our residential line of business was 0.8%.", "We continue to meet with municipalities that are seeking concessions and we're working with them to change service levels, extend contracts or offer value propositions that would benefit both the municipality and Waste Management. These are good business decisions, but they've negatively impacted our residential and our overall yield.", "In the third quarter of 2011, we saw improvement in our price rollbacks as they returned to more normal levels after a spike in the second quarter. We maintained customer churn at about 10.7% in the third quarter, a 10 basis point improvement from the same quarter in the prior year. We need to continue to focus on retaining our customers, and we expect our churn rate to improve into 2012. On the landfill yield front, the special waste and C&D waste streams had the sixth consecutive quarter of positive internal revenue growth from yield. ", "In recent months, we've increased our environmental fees as our environmental costs continue to rise. We've also continued our general price increase program, and those actions will be reflected in our fourth quarter yield results. However, a change in contract pricing at one of our waste-to-energy operations in South Florida will have between a negative $5 million and a negative $6 million impact on yield in the fourth quarter. Excluding this from our yield calculations, we expect our fourth quarter results to bring us very close to achieving 2% yield for the full year.", "On the volume side of the business, internal revenue growth from volume declined 2% in the quarter. If you exclude the volumes associated with the Gulf Coast cleanup efforts in 2010, IRG from volume declined only 0.3% in the quarter. Our commercial collection line of business saw a year-over-year IRG from volume decline of 4.1%, and the residential line of business saw a 3.4% decline year-over-year. Both of these collection lines improved sequentially from the second quarter and are the best IRG volume results that we've seen in 2011 for these business lines. ", "Industrial IRG from volume declined by 2.9% on a year-over-year basis, which is an improvement from the second quarter of 2011. So collection volumes are improving but not as fast as volumes from recycling, which on an organic basis, grew 8% year-over-year. If we include recycling volumes we obtained from acquisitions, our recycling volumes have increased 14% year-over-year. As you know, customers are becoming more interested in diversion and we have a growing network of MRFs to support this demand. We will continue to invest in recycling assets to better meet our customers' needs.", "In the landfill side of the business, third quarter 2011 internal revenue growth from volume improved by 1.5% compared to the third quarter of 2010. IRG from volume for special waste was positive 3.6% year-over-year. IRG from C&D volume declined 0.4% and MSW volumes declined 4.8% year-over-year. The MSW internal revenue growth from volume improved 270 basis points from the second quarter of 2011.", "Income from operations in the collection line of business improved 2% in the third quarter when compared to the same quarter last year. This was our highest third quarter income from operations and our highest margin in the collection lines of business in more than 6 years. We increased our income from operations despite lower volumes by flexing costs and maintaining our pricing discipline. ", "In our waste-to-energy line of business, income from operations declined $10 million, primarily related to the expiration of a long-term power capacity agreement in our South Florida market. In the fourth quarter, we expect income from operations in our waste-to-energy business to be flat when compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. Our position as a leader in the North American recycling business continues to be a strength in 2011, with increased commodity prices and volumes contributing about $0.05 of positive year-over-year earnings per diluted share in the third quarter. ", "Commodity prices have increased approximately 29% and recycling volumes, including acquisitions, have increased approximately 14% when compared with the same quarter last year. In the fourth quarter, we expect commodity prices to decline modestly from their current levels and we expect earnings per diluted share from recycling to be about flat compared to the fourth quarter last year. As you may recall, recycling prices in the fourth quarter of 2010 remained strong throughout the quarter. But we expect 2011 to be more in line with long-term historic trends, with commodity prices showing a seasonal downtick in the fourth quarter. We saw the beginning of that seasonal downtick in late October.", "The integration of Oakleaf into our company is progressing as we expected. Since the acquisition, we've closed on several new business opportunities and expanded some existing contracts. We're continuing to work with the customers and the third-party hauler network to ensure a smooth transition. Our relationship with the third-party haulers is strong and we're working with them to find solutions that will benefit customers, haulers and Waste Management. ", "With the holiday season upon us, customers want to ensure that any service transition will not interrupt their seasonal business. So the integration will slow somewhat over the holiday season and will speed up beginning in the first quarter of 2012. Consequently, we should see the benefits from the Oakleaf acquisition begin to ramp up in the second quarter of next year.", "In the third quarter of 2011, we saw the best volume performance we've seen in sometime, which is encouraging. However, we need to see further strength in our MSW and commercial lines before we can be comfortable that this is a sustainable trend and that we'll see positive year-over-year volume comparisons. So for the remainder of the year, we expect volumes to follow the same pattern as the rest of the year, at about negative 1.5% to negative 2%, which makes it important that we maintain our focus on costs and pricing. By doing so, we still expect to achieve full year adjusted earnings of between $2.14 and $2.18 per share -- per diluted share. ", "And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.", "Steven Preston", "All right. Thank you, David. It's great to be here. It sure beats competing against Waste Management. I'm also looking forward to meeting many of you on the phone in the near future as I get out on the road. So I'm going to give an overview of our costs and our cash flows, and then we will open the line up for some questions. ", "Our operating costs increased by $172 million in the quarter to 63.2% of revenue. The biggest contributor was cost of goods sold, which increased $92 million in the quarter, mainly because of rebates to recycling customers due to higher recycling commodity prices and volumes. Direct fuel costs increased about $39 million. That was primarily because of a 32% increase in price per gallon of diesel fuel. And in the third quarter, the fuel surcharge revenue actually offset the higher cost of the fuel completely. ", "Labor costs increased $21 million in the quarter, primarily related to merit increases. Tuck-in and other acquisitions contributed about $17 million to the increase in foreign currency translation for our Canadian operations accounted for an increase of about $7 million. ", "We also achieved approximately $28 million of benefit in operating expense in the third quarter from the actions that we took to reduce discretionary spending and eliminate positions, as well as from the expanded rollout of our procurement initiatives. We expect to see an increasing benefit from those initiatives in the fourth quarter, even more so, going into 2012. SG&A costs in the third quarter were flat year-over-year but improved as a percentage of revenue by 60 basis points to 10.8%, despite the fact that we spent about $10 million on those procurement and cost reduction initiatives.", "Our third quarter of 2011 was affected by several special items that were identified in our press release. As we normally do, we have adjusted for asset impairments and restructuring costs. We also excluded the accounting impact on our environmental remediation obligations due to changes in the 10-year Treasury rate, which have declined from 3.5% to 2.0%. ", "And finally, last year, we excluded the negative impact of creating a $28 million closed landfill remediation reserve. So in the third quarter, we also excluded a $9 million benefit from reducing that reserve when a lower cost remediation was selected by the EPA. And as we mentioned on the second quarter conference call, we also adjusted for Oakleaf integration costs and operations.", "Interest expense for the third quarter decreased $9 million compared with the prior year period, primarily due to the improved pricing of our $2 billion revolving credit facility, which was amended in May of 2011. And also, at the end of the quarter, our average -- weighted average cost of debt was 5.3%. Our debt to total capital ratio for the quarter was 60.5%. That was consistent with our target ratio of 60%, and the floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 17% at the end of the quarter. ", "Our income tax rate, as reported for the third quarter of 2011, was 32.3%. The reduction in our third quarter rate is primarily due to audit settlements and adjustments from filing our 2010 income tax return that benefited our EPS by about $0.02 a share. For the full year, we expect the recurring effective tax rate to be approximately 35%. ", "Turning now to cash flow. Third quarter 2011 net cash provided by operating activities was $659 million. In the third quarter of 2010, we received a federal tax refund of $65 million. So if you exclude that item, net cash provided from operations increased $47 million or 7.7%. Our capital expenditures for the third quarter were $313 million, leading us to a free cash flow for the third quarter of $372 million, which was $52 million less than the prior year. That was largely due to an increase in CapEx of $51 million, as well as the $65 million federal tax refund we received in 2010. We still expect our free cash flow for 2011 to be about $1.25 billion.", "In the third quarter of 2011, we paid $158 million in dividends. We also repurchased $360 million worth of our common stock, continuing our long-standing emphasis on returning cash to shareholders. In October, we also repurchased an additional $47 million of common stock to complete our board-authorized share repurchase program for 2011 of $575 million. And finally, we completed approximately $488 million in business acquisitions, including Oakleaf, during the third quarter.", "So in conclusion, we are entering fourth quarter with a stable price and volume environment, solid momentum in our procurement and cost reduction initiatives, as well as good progress on the Oakleaf acquisition. ", "So with that, Brandi, let's open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Wunderlich.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Welcome onboard, Steve. On the recycling price issue, it would appear that 2012, we're not going to fall of a cliff but in all likelihood, prices will probably average lower than they have in 2011. Can you talk about any kind of a metric that you have, a $10 move equals what or -- to think about what that headwind will look like going into 2012?", "Steven Preston", "Yes, if you look at recycling prices -- and obviously, it's driven by fiber but a $10 movement in fiber prices equates to about $0.01 a year.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay, equals $0.01. All right, that's great. And then on the free cash flow side, the word about -- I mean, it makes me think of the people in New England using the word \"yonder\" and it means around the corner or 20 miles, how do we think about what about is as you think about the free cash? And more importantly, to make $1.25, either you're going to have one heck of a cash from ops number, which sounds like a big working capital shift or you spend less money. How do we get there based on where you are year-to-date?", "Steven Preston", "Yes. Well, we certainly have some hard work to do to hit that $1.25 of target but we do believe it's achievable. It's, certainly, Michael, not in the bag. We're going to have to be very focused, I think, in the fourth quarter on managing working capital, as well especially focusing on capital expenditure. So I think it's going to come from a number of places, but we're really going to have to focus on every one of them to bring that number over the line.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "But do you stay with your budget of $1.35 million in CapEx, given that you've got 100% bonus depreciation this year and maybe not next year?", "Steven Preston", "I think we stay with our budget of $1.35 million for the time being although we're -- the fourth quarter is a big quarter for CapEx. We're looking very hard at the entire list of expenditures that we're expecting to make this quarter and making sure that every $0.01 we put out there is well spent. So there's certainly an incentive to do it this year because of bonus depreciation, but I think we're also going to be very circumspect in what we -- in the amount that we spend.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then there was a slide presentation you all did recently at a conference. It's Slide 19, and it showed a cost saves and then sort of a second half, the benefit. And basically, the conclusion was between the third full quarter and the fourth quarter, there ought to be a $0.05 improvement. Are we going to still see that $0.05? And that means then, it's a $0.68 number in the fourth quarter for earnings?", "Steven Preston", "Well I think there are a number of moving pieces there. I think in terms of the cost improvement, we still expect to see strong sequential improvement between the 2 quarters and that's going to come really from a number of areas. When you look at that $0.04 to $0.05 to the $0.09 to $0.10 from third to fourth quarter, that includes a number of components, right? It includes the revenue improvement initiatives that some of which David went through. The environmental surcharge and the price increases includes the labor reductions that I mentioned. It includes the procurement initiatives. So there are a number of different pieces that go in there. And so I think every one of those components is actually going to see some sequential strength from third to fourth quarter. Now some of that is going to -- from a year-over-year basis, it's going to be somewhat offset by the commodity pricing that you mentioned because we had a strong benefit from commodities in the third quarter. Fourth quarter to fourth quarter, we're going to see less of that. So to an extent, some of that benefit we're seeing on the cost side is going to be -- is going to serve to offset the commodity price benefit we got in the third quarter.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So that slide should be revised, and it shouldn't be $0.05 improvement sequentially then.", "David P. Steiner", "Michael, it's probably not a full $0.05 because remember, as Steve said, that's both cost and revenue. We're probably $0.01 behind, maybe $0.01, maybe $0.02 behind on that, mainly coming from our growth initiatives. But then, as Steve mentioned, we got a $0.05 benefit in the third quarter from recycling. We don't expect to get a $0.05 year-over-year benefit in the fourth quarter.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "That's fair enough. I just want to understand how the numbers should play out as far as the model. And then the tax rate, if you're going to do 35% for the year, that means fourth quarter has to be much higher. What are you using for your fourth quarter to get to the 35% for the year?", "Steven Preston", "Right. So the 35% for the year was sort of -- I think the words I used were the recurring tax rate. What we were trying to do is basically say the base tax rate that we're looking at is $35 million [ph]. But periodically, as we announced in the quarter, we have adjustments that would have stacked that number. So in the fourth quarter -- right now, if you look at that 35%, that would not assume any of those adjustments but I don't want to call that yet. We may have somewhat of an impact from fourth quarter tax adjustments. But at this point, that's -- think of that as more the recurring underlying tax rate of the business.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, if BP was $47 million -- or not $47 million, 1.7% in the third quarter, what is it in the fourth quarter?", "David P. Steiner", "It's about 80 basis points in the fourth quarter.", "Operator", ".", "Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "The first question is just on pricing. Were you expecting pricing to accelerate relative to the second quarter? And then, maybe if you could just comment on where you're seeing increased competition, in which market? And is the pricing headwind all due to these resi contracts? And maybe just touch on how aggressive you're being on the landfill side.", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, when we look at pricing, from a competitive point of view, I think we see a fairly stable pricing environment. Look, in a slow economy, I'd rather see that stable price environment where it was 3 years ago in a great economy, 3%, 3.5%. But in a slow economy, you'd expect there to be a little more competitive reaction and we've seen that but it hasn't been anything dramatic. So when we look at the third quarter, most of the pricing actions that we took, the raise in the environmental fee and moving up price increases, most of them occurred throughout the quarter so we didn't get the full benefit in the third quarter. We certainly will see that uptick in the fourth quarter. So in the third quarter, it was offset a little bit by residential pricing, both CPI and price rollbacks that we've had to put in to maintain contracts. But again, those are good decisions. We're going to take the right pricing actions to maintain the right business. And so we continue to have rollbacks albeit at a much lower level than in the second quarter. We continue to see residential pricing a little bit weak. So that was the headwind in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, again, we've got that one big contractual headwind in South Florida from our waste-to-energy plant. If you exclude that, we would expect to see improvement in the fourth quarter on the pricing side.", "Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And just on the landfill side, what are you guys pushing through on price right now and how much additional running room do you think you have there?", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, I think we have a lot of additional running room. Basically, if you look at the overall landfill pricing, it's up about 1.3%. But we still have plenty of room to go there.", "Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And just on Oakleaf, how much -- how should we think about that business in terms of what it's generating right now on EBITDA? You said you can bring that up to $80 million of EBITDA. How long does that process take? What is the business generating right now and what do you have baked into your guidance for Oakleaf?", "Steven Preston", "All right. So Oakleaf right now, I think, was about a cost of $0.01 a share in the quarter. And that is really the mixture of fully unintegrated Oakleaf plus any integration costs associated with that, as well as higher interest expense. And think of the next 2 to 3 quarters as being heavy integration periods. So I think, in the next couple of quarters, we would expect it to look roughly like we do now. I think some of those integration costs are going to hit sequentially over the next few quarters. Getting into the middle of next year, we would really begin to see -- we expect to see a pretty significant ramp in the benefit from Oakleaf, and that comes from really 2 -- 3 primary areas. Okay? It comes from working with third-party haulers to expand our relationships with them. So that if Oakleaf is giving a hauler business, we have the opportunity, not only to get the disposal work on that particular haul, but to expand our relationship. So it's an important incentive to drive disposal volume to our facilities. Secondly, in a number of the markets, Waste Management will be taking some of that volume and internalizing it. And then thirdly, there is a significant opportunity to consolidate the operational side of the 2 companies we have. Many aspects of what both companies do are overlapping. And as we put those on one platform, we would expect to see the benefit. So as you ramp that up, the next 2 or 3 quarters, we would be sequentially taking some costs to drive that integration. Some of that is going to be for streamlining. Some of that is going to be for equipment that we put out in the field and repair. And then really sort of in the second quarter going through the third, fourth quarters of next year, we would expect to see that ramping. Full year next year, I don't think it's going to be a significant impact. But the run rate coming out of 2012, sort of fourth quarter going into the following year, is when we would expect to really be achieving that full benefit.", "Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Got you. That's helpful. And just the last question, on SG&A. On your long-term SG&A target, does that need to change now given the macroeconomic environment we're in, as well as the sort of structural cost takeout that you plan to do? It seems like that's a little behind. Does that need to change or you feel pretty comfortable with that?", "David P. Steiner", "No. Actually, I feel very comfortable with that but it's going to be driven primarily by technological upgrades. Right? I mean, when you look at our SG&A costs, we have a lot of costs that are out in non-consolidated functions. And so you've got to drive those consolidations with technology. And so I fully expect to see that happen over the next 2, 2.5 years.", "Operator", ".", "Our next question comes from the line of Scott Levine with JPMorgan.", "Scott J Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Welcome aboard, Steve. First question, additional color on pricing. I think last quarter you had indicated that the Southeast, in particular, was challenging, and it was residential municipal that were the areas where you're experiencing the most pressure. And I think you've affirmed that the latter is still true. I was wondering if you could provide any additional regional color with regard to pricing additions across your entire footprint, whether there are any changes versus 3, 6 months ago, perhaps?", "David P. Steiner", "Yes. I think when you look at our yield being pretty steady the last 2 quarters at 1.6%, the word -- again, the word to use is stability. And so we don't see any sort of unusual pricing action in any particular area of the company. Where we've seen the most pricing pressure has been on the rollback side and then in the residential line. And then you've got -- the South has certainly had struggles. Part of it is down in South Florida with our waste energy plants. A lot of those contracts, a lot of those disposal contracts were long-term disposal contracts. And they happen to be rolling off much like some of our electricity contracts. They happen to be rolling off at a time when the market isn't as strong as it was 4 years ago. If that -- if this contract had rolled off 4 years ago, we'd be in a heck of a lot better shape than we would be today. It just so happens that contract is rolling off in South Florida, and that's going to --  that's going to hit us. But again, if you eliminate that contract from the fourth quarter, we fully expect to see price begin its march back up. And then next year, when you see CPI getting better, we'd expect that to continue. Now again, next year -- every year is harder than the prior year because you've got a lot of different things like fees and surcharges anniversaring. And so we've got to find a way to overcome those.", "Scott J Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Got it. But again, to reiterate your point on CPI and the impact of CPI on your pricing, your expectation is that will have a positive impact on core price in '12?", "David P. Steiner", "Should have a positive impact, yes.", "Scott J Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Got it. And then turning to free cash flow deployment. You guys have been aggressive with the buyback, it seems, in the third quarter. You guys typically make an announcement, I believe, on the dividend in December. Any changes in terms of the thought process moving [ph] into next year in terms of free cash flow deployment or your appetite for acquisitions?", "David P. Steiner", "No, I wouldn't expect any dramatic shift.", "Scott J Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. One last question, I think in the operating revenues by lines of business, it looks like your revenues from other had roughly doubled sequentially from $105 million to $210 million. I was wondering if you could remind us of what's in that category.", "David P. Steiner", "Would that be the Oakleaf revenue? I'm asking our folks here.", "Steven Preston", "Oakleaf would be about $106 million.", "David P. Steiner", "Yes.", "Scott J Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. So that's almost all of it there?", "David P. Steiner", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Corey Greendale with First Analysis.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division", "First of all, I just -- I wanted to clarify on the guidance, the full year EPS guidance, does that use the $0.63 in Q3?", "David P. Steiner", "Correct.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division", "Okay. And then, I was hoping, David, you might be able to just talk a little bit about what has shifted in terms of your expectations from the last conference call. I don't know if $0.63 was exactly what you were anticipating or not. But just -- if you could kind of quickly touch on price volume, the cost side of it, just what -- and commodity prices, what the moving pieces are in terms of what shifted since last quarter.", "David P. Steiner", "Yes. When you look at this quarter compared to last quarter, obviously, our -- you've got sort of a double whammy. Right? We've spent a lot less on our short-term and long-term cost and revenue initiatives. So we spent less and we saved more, and you should see that continuing into the fourth quarter. We're going to spend less and save more. So when we looked at third and fourth quarter, we knew we had to do $1.25 just to get to the bottom end of the range. And we knew that, historically, our fourth quarter is slightly down from our third quarter. So we knew we had to have cost savings ramping up, going into the fourth quarter in order to make the year. And I'm pleased to see that that's exactly what happened in the third quarter. So we're pretty comfortable with that range $2.14 to $2.18.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division", "Okay. And just on the $0.63. So the -- within the bullet point kind of description in the press release. And you mentioned in the commentary, Steve, there's the benefit of the tax item, and you didn't pull that out of the $0.63. So could you talk about why we should view that as more of a recurring item and shouldn't pull that out of the $0.63?", "David P. Steiner", "I mean, look, there's absolutely no doubt that we would rather have that $0.02 to be driven by cash-generating items than tax rate. But taxes are what taxes are, right? I mean, they're going to fluctuate year-to-year. So earlier in the year, we paid a higher tax rate because of -- before we have these audit settlements. And so we sort of paid that price in the early part of the year. This was basically just the catchup from the higher tax rate we had earlier in the year.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division", "Okay. And one more, I think in your commentary, David, you've mentioned that you think churn will improve going into 2012. Just -- can you give us a little bit more on that why you think churn improved?", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, look, with churn -- look, the churn rate is driven, as you can imagine, a lot by our rollback rate. And we need to make good, balanced pricing decisions, right? And so when a customer calls up, there's certainly more competitive action out there going after customers. And again, you'd expect that in a lower-volume environment. We need to make the right decisions to maintain those customers and if that means that we have to roll back the price, we're going to look at that piece of business and determine, is it worth rolling back the price or do we let that customer go? And so we're going to put an added focus on that. But look, the reality is that most customers don't leave over price. They leave over service issues. And so as we use technology to improve our service issues, we fully expect that. And as we become an easier company to do business with, we fully expect that to drive down the churn rate.", "Operator", ".", "Our next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk with Wedbush.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "I was hoping, David, you could provide a little bit more detail on your outlook and expectations as it relates to commodity, commodity prices, given it's a little bit greater impact now in your business and what appears to be a little bit more than seasonal volatility in the October prices of OCC and ONP. So I hear you say that there's not maybe headwinds or easier comps over the next 4 quarters, but could you talk about maybe what the drag could be?", "David P. Steiner", "Sure. And with commodities, you're absolutely right. We're more and more moving toward that in our business, and commodities have become certainly a worldwide market. And so you've got the export market, primarily China, driving a lot of pricing, including driving some of the domestic pricing. And so traditionally, what you see in the fourth quarter is you see the pricing tick down as the Chinese mills start -- they've already shipped a lot of their Christmas goods, and so they're starting to slow down in the back half of the year. So you see the China mills start to slow down, and then you'll see the domestic mills start to slow down. And that's, frankly, exactly what we're seeing today. We're seeing the Chinese mills starting to slow down, and so you're seeing pricing come back in China 15% to 20%. That really hasn't hit the domestic market yet. We fully expect that the domestic market will soften beginning in sort of throughout the November time frame. And then we'll go back into a stable pricing environment as we come out of the new year. That's been the historical trend. Last year, frankly, was the anomaly. Last year, fourth quarter prices stayed strong throughout the fourth quarter. So what we're seeing here is nothing that we didn't expect. We're looking at flat year-over-year earnings. If we continue to see deterioration in the export market, could we have maybe $0.01 impact, a negative $0.01 impact in the fourth quarter? We could, but it's certainly not what we're projecting right now.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Just to clear up here, the fourth quarter or the full year $2.14 to $2.18, are you assuming current prices or what you had at the beginning of the year in terms of average price for commodities? Or how should we think, because I know you said earlier, $10 drop would equate to about $0.01. I assume that's for the full year, but we have seen more than $10 just in each of the past couple of weeks in those markets so...", "David P. Steiner", "Well, we absolutely have. But what we're looking at -- it depends on if you look at it sequentially, if you look at it year-over-year. When you look at it year-over-year, you've got 2 things: you had strong prices throughout the quarter in the fourth quarter last year; and then we've got more volume. Remember, we grew volume by 14% year-over-year so that helps make up for the earnings on a year-over-year comparison. But you're absolutely right, it goes back to what Steve was talking about earlier. On a sequential basis, you will see weakening in prices. And so you can't just say, \"We're going to save money in cost and that gets sequentially added to the third quarter,\" because you will have a sequential downturn in earnings from recycling. And so those are going to obviously offset each other to make up -- to help us drive that fourth quarter earning.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "And then my follow-up or second question, sort of a 2-parter, if I may, could you comment or provide quantified EPS impact on amortization from Oakleaf transaction? And then secondly, you had talked about, and I know this is in progress, but $100-plus million contribution for the quarter. But what are you hearing from the customers about the ability to sustain the relationship with WM going forward?", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, actually, the customer relationship part has been very encouraging. We put together a plan, Steve and his group, when we started to look at doing the deal. The very first thing we put together was a plan to get out and meet with the customers and let the customers know that this combination for them is actually going to be very good. What you've got is a combination of the biggest and the best company in the industry from a brokerage point of view that knows where to go to get services. And you've also got the biggest and the best company from an asset point of view on the range of recycling and other assets that can meet those customers' needs. And so as we like to say, the combination made us both stronger and so we're able to better meet the wide range of customer needs. So, so far, the customer relationships have been very good. We've actually expanded business with a number of those customers and added a number of new customers that were in the Oakleaf pipeline. So, so far, that's been spectacular. We're looking forward to bringing that combined service offering to a lot more customers in 2012.", "Steven Preston", "I think that's right. And just to answer your first question, on a quarterly basis, we're looking at about $7.5 million worth of amortization.", "Operator", ".", "There appears to be no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference back over to Mr. David Steiner for closing remarks.", "David P. Steiner", "Thank you, Brandi. Thank you, all, for joining us. We'll be seeing you on the road and looking forward to introducing you to Steve. And we won't talk again until 2012. So given that, have a happy holiday season, and we'll see you next year.", "Operator", ".", "Thank you for participating in today's Waste Management Third Quarter 2011 Conference Call.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2011 earnings conference call. With me this morning are David Steiner, Chief Executive Officer; and Steve Preston, Executive Vice President of Finance, Recycling and Energy Services. David will start things off with a summary of the financial results for the quarter and an overview of our plans for 2012. Dave will cover our revenue growth, including price and volume trends, operating costs and the financial statements. We will conclude with questions and answers. During their statements, any comparisons made by David and Steve, unless otherwise stated, will be with the fourth quarter of 2010.", "Before we get started, let me remind you that in addition to our earnings press release that was issued this morning, we have filed a Form 8-K that includes the earnings press release as Exhibit 99.1 and is available on our website at www.wm.com.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of Waste Management is prohibited. ", "Now I'll turn the call over to Waste Management CEO, David Steiner.", "David P. Steiner", "Thanks, Ed. Good morning from Houston. Looking back at the full year, 2011 was a year of continued investment in our future and a growing conviction that we're on the right track in transforming our company for continued leadership in an evolving industry. We produced strong free cash flow in 2011 despite volumes being below our original expectations, which enabled us to invest in our future and position the company to accelerate our earnings as volumes improve. 2011 had a number of other positives. We invested in programs to drive costs out of our system. Those programs took hold throughout 2011 and we'll supplement them with new programs in 2012. We saw volumes improve throughout the year, and we expect to see continued improvement in 2012. Recycling prices were strong through the first 3 quarters of 2011. We added a number of recycling assets during the year and expect to add more in 2012, which will contribute to our continued growth in this strategic area. And finally, we supplemented our national accounts approach through our strategic acquisition of Oakleaf. That will provide us a new platform to service national accounts while strengthening the Oakleaf vendor network. ", "Now turning to the recent quarter, we had a very solid fourth quarter. We earned $0.63 per share, an increase of 5% compared to the $0.60 we earned in the prior year quarter. Our collection, landfill and transfer station businesses performed well during the quarter and had their best income from operations margin since 2006. In the fourth quarter, our total revenue growth from yield for our commercial and industrial lines of business recovered to the highs that we experienced in the first quarter of 2011. And our commercial new business pricing was at the highest level since 2010. Despite a very competitive market, our fourth quarter results reflect our continued commitment to yield management. ", "On the volume side, we've seen positive signs as each of our collection and MSW landfill lines of business have improved sequentially for 3 consecutive quarters. We continue to benefit from strong growth in special waste and recycling commodity volumes. ", "Finally, during 2011, we continued to produce strong cash flows and returned cash to our shareholders. For the full year, our net cash provided by operating activities was $2.5 billion. We had over $1.2 billion of free cash flow, and we returned $1.2 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We also spent $867 million on acquisitions in 2011, about half of that was on our Oakleaf acquisition and the remainder primarily on recycling assets and tuck-in collection operations. ", "Turning to 2012. We continue to see competitive pricing on new residential municipal contracts and in the commercial line of business. Nevertheless, we'll continue our disciplined approach to yield management. In the first half of 2012, yield will be negatively affected by the effect of our waste-to-energy business on our yield and some rollbacks we implemented to extend municipal contracts. But we expect yield to pick up in the back half of the year as many of the contract issues anniversary, our second half municipal contracts CPI adjustments take effect and we maintain our focus on our core yields programs. ", "So overall, we expect yield to average 1% to 1.5% for the year. We expect the full year 2012 internal revenue growth from volumes to be flat to slightly positive compared with 2011. In the first few weeks of 2012, we've seen a mild winter, but until we see the seasonal uptick in volumes and positive volumes in MSW and commercial yards, we're hesitant to say that margins will improve substantially in 2012. ", "During the fourth quarter, recycling commodity prices declined approximately 8%. For 2012, we expect recycling commodity sales prices to be below the 2011 average by about $15 to $20 per ton. Even at these lower levels, prices are still above the 5-year average, and we will continue to invest in recycling assets to better meet our customers' increasing recycling needs. And lower recycling commodity prices should have a negative year-over-year impact on earnings per share of approximately $0.03 to $0.05, most of which will occur in the first half of the year. Also on the commodity front, electricity prices have remained stubbornly low. This will certainly have a negative impact on 2012 income from operations at our waste-to-energy plants. We also have substantial rollbacks on tip fees in our South Florida waste-to-energy business. At one of our plants, below our tip fee went into effect last August. And at the other plant, it starts early this year. In all, we expect the year-over-year impact on diluted earnings per share from our waste-to-energy operations to be negative $0.04 to negative $0.06 per share. Again, virtually all in the first half of the year. ", "Our long-standing business model is to use yield and cost savings programs to offset inflation in our cost base in order to drive margin expansion. And when volumes turn positive, we get great leverage off of our high fixed cost base. ", "In the first quarter of 2012, yield will be muted and we'll reinvest some of our cost savings into our routing and logistics initiatives. On top of that, the first quarter is our seasonally slowest volume quarter, so it will be very difficult for us to overcome the $0.05 to $0.06 of headwinds that we've mentioned for the first quarter. But in the second quarter, we'll see our seasonal uptick in volumes and earnings should improve. Then in the third and fourth quarters, we expect the headwinds to abate, yield to pick up, and we should get strong earnings benefits from our Oakleaf integration, our cost programs and improving volumes. The combination of all those positive trends in the second half of the year should drive substantial growth in earnings and margin expansion and allow us to achieve our 2012 targets. We expect to achieve our second half and full year earnings growth by remaining focused on our 3 key long-term strategies, namely, knowing our customers better, which will lead to higher sales and retention; investing in recycling and other diversion assets to extract more value from the waste stream; and investing in programs to increase our operational efficiency. ", "On the customer front, we remain committed to increasing revenue by providing customized and unique solutions for our customers. For example with municipalities, we can offer a very impressive array of additional services. We can offer single-stream recycling, CNG trucks, Bagster, At Your Door household hazardous waste removal and recycling rewards through our new relationship with Recyclebank. Another example of our customer focus is our Oakleaf acquisition, which has accelerated our penetration into the retail and restaurant segments. ", "With respect to diversion assets, in 2011 we increased our emphasis on recycling and also made some small investments in organic's processing assets. And we continue to make small investments in new technologies. We expect that some of these new technology companies will reach the public market in 2012 and 2013. And we will continue to look for ways to maximize our return on those investments. ", "Finally, in 2011 we focused on reducing costs through better supply chain management. We achieved savings in our procurement of third-party transportation, travel expenses and telecommunication costs. In 2012, we expect these savings to accelerate, and we expect to generate additional cost reductions. For instance, we will continue to improve the delivery of our services in the field through more efficient routes, reduced unproductive time and better customer support with greater use of onboard computing technology and reengineering field processes. ", "In summary, 2011 was a tough year, but we finished it on a positive note with strong fourth quarter results that we will build upon going into 2012. In 2012, the first half of the year will be harder than the second half of the year, but we expect the back half of the year to provide solid earnings growth that will position the company well for continued earnings growth. Our employees are focused on continuing the progress that we've made on our strategy, and in 2012 we expect once again to accomplish our goals of growing our revenue, increasing our return on invested capital and returning cash to our shareholders. ", "And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve to discuss our fourth quarter results and our 2012 outlook in more detail.", "Steven Preston", "Thank you, David. I'd like to review the contributions from yield and volume in the various lines of business to give you a better sense of trending going into this year, and then I'll get into the drivers in some of the key expense and cash flow lines. Revenue for the fourth quarter, excluding Oakleaf's, increased $94 million or 2.3% from the prior period. This is the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. Our revenue improvement was driven by year-over-year increases in both field and acquisitions, and we also began to see improving volume trends in many areas of business. ", "Internal revenue growth from yield on our collection and disposal operations was 1.4% in the quarter and 1.8% for the full year. A change in pricing at one of our waste-to-energy plants in South Florida reduced fourth quarter yield by 30 basis points and the full year by 20 basis points. So without this adjustment in South Florida, the yield for the year would have actually been 2.0%. The combined internal revenue growth from yield in our collection business was 2.6% in the fourth quarter, with 4.1% growth in commercial, 2.8% growth in industrial and 0.5% growth in residential. ", "In the landfill line of business, internal revenue growth from yield was positive in both the MSW and C&D segments. That improvement was, however, offset by lower yield in special waste business, which is highly variable based on the nature and the geography of the jobs. The biggest drivers of the special waste decline were increased volume for soil and sludge jobs and an increase in lower price direct landfill jobs at our subtitle sea landfills. But in total, special waste was actually a good story because the overall business grew nicely in the quarter. ", "As in the past, we will remain our commitment to yield improvement in 2012. Our 2012 first half comparisons will be negatively affected by the rate reductions we accepted when we renewed our South Florida waste-to-energy contracts as well as major residential contracts. In the second half, pricing in most of these contracts will be comparable to the prior year, and we should begin to see CPI price increases in a large number of residential franchises. So our yield in the second half should benefit from more favorable comparisons. ", "On the volume side of the business, internal revenue growth from volume declined 0.6% in the quarter, which is actually encouraging since it's the smallest decline we've seen since before 2008. In fact, internal growth in our landfill and transfer station businesses is the best result we've seen since before 2008. And in the collection line of business, it's the best result since the third quarter of 2010. More specifically, internal growth from collection volumes declined 3.8% in commercial, 2.2% in industrial and 1.3% in residential for the fourth quarter. These collection volume declines were nearly offset by the landfill side of the business where fourth quarter 2011 internal growth was positive 4.9%, which is the best quarterly performance we've seen in many years. While MSW internal growth from volume was negative 2.8%, it's a marked improvement from the negative 5.5% we saw in the third quarter of 2011 and the smallest decline since early 2010. C&D was slightly positive at 0.9%, and special waste was positive at 12.9%. ", "In addition, recycling improved 2% internally in the quarter and 9.1%, including acquisitions. Income from operations in the collection line of business improved 3.5% in the fourth quarter when compared to the same quarter of last year, while operating margins increased 20 basis points. We again increased our income from operations despite lower volumes by flexing our costs and maintaining our yield discipline. The landfill business improved 4.6% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. And in both cases, these are the best operating margins we've seen in these business lines since 2006. ", "Operating costs increased by $70 million in the fourth quarter to 62% of revenue compared to 61.2% in the fourth quarter of 2010. The increase primarily consists of direct fuel costs of $30 million, recycling rebates of $13 million and acquisitions at $26 million. As you know, all of these items have offsets in the revenue line as well. SG&A costs were $367 million in the fourth quarter, flat when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. So as a percentage of revenue, SG&A costs improved 20 basis points to 11.3%. In the fourth quarter, higher wages and associated benefits were offset by savings related to lower professional fees and lower travel and entertainment costs. We expect full year 2012 SG&A costs to remain flat as a percentage of revenue. ", "At year end, our weighted average cost to debt was 5.4%, and our total debt-to-capital ratio for the quarter was 60.4%, which is consistent with our target ratio of about 60%. And the floating rate portion of debt in our total debt portfolio was 18% at the end of the quarter. Our income tax rate as reported in the fourth quarter was 32.5%. That reduction in our fourth quarter rate is primarily due to audit settlements as well as tax credits. ", "Turning now to cash flow. Fourth quarter 2011 net cash flow provided by operating activities was $732 million. This is an increase of $110 million from the fourth quarter of 2010 or 17.7%. And the increase is primarily related to improvements in working capital. Our capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $415 million and our free cash flow for the quarter was $331 million. So for the full year of 2011, free cash flow was over $1.2 billion after capital expenditures of approximately $1.3 billion and excluding the impact of litigation loss of $27 million. In the fourth quarter, we also paid $156 million of dividends, and we repurchased $47 million of our common stock. So for the full year 2011, we paid $637 million of dividends, and we repurchased 575 million of our common stock, returning over $1.2 billion to shareholders. ", "Our 2012 capital allocation plan allows us, again, to return up to $1.2 billion to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Our Board has indicated an increase in our dividend of 4.4% to $1.42 per share on an annual basis, resulting in a dividend yield of approximately 4.1%. This is the ninth consecutive year of increasing dividends. The dividend has grown from $0.01 a share in 2003 to $1.42 in 2012. So for 2012, the anticipated dividend equates to $665 million being returned to shareholders. The Board has also authorized up to $500 million in share repurchases. As always, the amount of share repurchases will depend on a number of items including changes from expected levels of capital expenditures, business acquisitions and investments and debt repayments. We expect between $150 million and $200 million, $250 million in business acquisitions and investments, and we expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.4 billion. Free cash flow in 2002 (sic) [2012] is expected to be between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion and that includes a negative impact from bonus depreciation of approximately $200 million as compared to the 2011 cash taxes. ", "David also mentioned the impact in the first half of the year from commodity prices and from our waste-to-energy operations which should improve in the second half of 2012. At the same time, many of the drivers that will improve results in 2012 are more heavily weighted to the back half. The benefits from the Oakleaf integration will be negligible in the first half of the year, but are expected to accelerate in the second half as we complete the consolidation of our national account operations and we complete negotiations with our vendor hauler network to increase their use of our disposal facilities as well as our other services. ", "In addition, the benefit from our operational improvement programs will increase throughout the year. We've already begun to see the savings from our procurement programs, which we will use in part to fund 2 other initiatives we've discussed with you in the past, first driving efficiencies through routing technologies and not anymore computers and as well as streamlining our back office operations. The field efficiency programs are already in 4 areas. We'll continue to roll those out over the next 2 years. And the back office programs are in development and they will begin to roll out in 2013. So when you put it all together, we expect 2012 will be a year of solid earnings growth and continuing strength in cash flows, and we estimate that our 2012 fully diluted earnings per share will be between $2.22 and $2.30 a share. So with that, Regina, we'd like to open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Levine with JPMorgan.", "Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So with regard to your comments on price, the guidance implies relative stability in 2012 versus what you reported in the fourth quarter. I was wondering if you could comment on what kinds of trends you saw as the quarter played out. And then I think, David, you mentioned commercial in addition to the municipal business. I'm not sure whether there was any noteworthy development in that area, whether there was any additional color from a regional perspective, just looking for additional thoughts on price trend.", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, Scott, it's interesting when you look at 2012, and you're right, we mentioned both municipal and commercial, and the commercial business has always been highly competitive. It always will be highly competitive. And so you sort of see swings up and down. Would I expect 2012 to be a year where we get great price increases like we got in 2011? Yes, we're going to put those price increases out on the street. The issue that we had in 2011 I expect to continue through 2012 is rollbacks on the commercial side of business. And so from a competitive point of view, what you're seeing is more and more pressure requiring rollbacks and then you're also seeing a lot of companies that are offering new business without fees and surcharges. And so that's been the case forever. I'm sure it will be the case forever, and that's just what we have to deal with. We've got to do a better job of making sure that we don't roll back those price increases, because we'll continue to be aggressive, but we're just rolling them back too much. And then on the municipal side, you are seeing a little bit different pricing environment. It certainly -- those are big contracts, and so it's certainly become more aggressive. You've got municipalities that are facing budget shortfalls, so they've become more aggressive. And so when I look at 2012, the reason we will be, like you say, sort of flat to 2011 is that we've got to do a better job of the price rollbacks, and we're going to see deterioration in the municipal contracts not just because it's competitive but as you know, we've got that situation in South Florida with our Broward plant that all-in is going to have, as I recall, around a $20 million effect in 2012.", "Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Got it. And maybe turning to Oakleaf. So if I interpreted Steven's comments correctly, net neutral to earnings year-over-year in the first half and then positive in the second half, I'm assuming your guidance includes Oakleaf, because I know you excluded that from your operating number in '11, is that correct?", "Steven Preston", "Yes, that's right. When you look at Oakleaf throughout the year, there are 2 really primary pieces to that improvement. First of all, it's the consolidation of the operations for our national accounts. And that is happening really beginning in the first quarter coming in ratably through the year. The other piece really is important to the whole strategy that integration, which is making sure that we work with our vendors to optimize this relationships longer-term, both in terms of having a solid network in place and in terms of the financial benefit we get with those. So our teams are out there right night now negotiating arrangements which will begin ticking in really now through the second quarter going into the third quarter as we begin to drive more volumes to our disposal facilities and broaden our relationships with those vendors.", "Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Got it. One last one, if I may. Looks like the earnings sensitivity on the waste-to-energy side is as large as it is on the recycling side. Do you have a rule of thumb you can provide on EPS sensitivity to fluctuations on electricity pricing? A part of this is the Florida situation. Is there an EPS sensitivity that we can use for waste-to-energy like we have with recycling or like you've given?", "David P. Steiner", "I think when you look at the Wheelabrator impact, it more -- it feels more heavily with specific contract situations where we went from a fixed price arrangement to market price or a change in the tipping fees. Whereas there is some sensitivity, obviously to electricity prices, we're already at a very low level for electricity prices. As you know, those are tied to natural gas. So we actually would expect to see less downside volatility on the electricity prices. And hopefully none of us are expecting upside, we're not projecting that, but we're expecting that really pretty much to be flat this year. So it's both a smaller item. It's a lesser driver of the impact that we saw in Wheelabrator this year and we think that they are at relatively sustainable low levels right now.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Fisher with Raymond James.", "William H. Fisher - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "I had just a couple of questions related to recycling on price environment, really on the outlook for '12. I think you mentioned you expected the commodity price to be down $15 to $20 and, Dave, what would that be roughly beyond a percentage basis? And then kind of related to that, you're obviously growing recycling volumes very strongly, I think up 9%. With the acquisitions you did, could that number be up double digits in '12? I'm just wanted to get some color on that.", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, I think the $15 to $20 equates more sort of like to the 10% to 15% range on the commodity side. We do expect to see continuing growth in volumes. Some of those acquisitions will layer in positively in 2012 as well.", "William H. Fisher - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. I mean, could that be similar types of growth rates as you've seen in Q4? Does that kind of taper off?", "David P. Steiner", "I think we should see similar growth rates but we also did a few acquisitions in the fourth quarter, so you should see more volumes. Now the interesting thing about those acquisitions is that the first probably 3 to 6 months, you don't get a lot of earnings out of those deals. And so we'll see higher volumes throughout 2012. Obviously, we'll see the earnings impact in the back half of the year from the new plant.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Wunderlich Securities.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "One of the questions I have on volume in the guidance, container weights in the commercial business, are you seeing a trend where your starting approach is 0 which suggests that after 3 years of economic recovery, the consumers kind of found their behavior, and so container weights should stabilize and therefore, third-party volume come in hue [ph] with commercial, that's a positive?", "David P. Steiner", "Yes. It's interesting you asked that, Michael, because it's always one of the areas that I look each quarter. And surprisingly to me this quarter, we saw container weights across the company actually positive, and we saw them positive throughout each of the 4 geographic groups save one small area in the south. So seeing the container weights come back certainly is good news. But like we said, we've been saying now for a couple of years, we don't want to call a volume turn until we see sort of those core volumes, like you say commercial volumes in MSW turned. Right now a lot of our good volume numbers are being driven by special waste. And as you know, those can be cyclical as far as being event work. And so until we see that commercial business turn positive and we see the MSW turn positive, we don't want to call a turn in volumes, but it certainly was an encouraging sign to see container weights up in the quarter.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and I get that. So segueing into the special waste, do you have a sense of a pipeline of activity coming into that year that you can sort of frame -- you had some double-digit volume changes in '11. How do you think about those volume changes in light of your guidance in '12? What are we thinking about there?", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, I think we'll continue see strong volumes in special waste. As you know, the visibility on that is probably sort of the 3- to 6-month time frame, so it is hard to say anything long-term. But the jobs that we see coming into the first quarter, particularly because we've had good weather so far for most of the first quarter, the special waste continues to be strong.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then you produced about 8.5% of revenues and free cash today. What's its take, one, can you be a 10% free cash generator and if so, when do we see that? What happens in the model if this is the economy to live in by way, the economy isn't any different than it is right now, how do you get to be a 10% free cash generator?", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, Michael, if the economy stays the way it is right now, first off, obviously, we have to drive additional cash generation. And that's why we're investing in our cost programs, right? We're also got to continue to get good yield and that's going to drive cash generation. But then we've also got some fairly large numbers on CapEx. It will be at $1.4 billion again this year. And that's driven by the investment in fleet which, as you know, we underinvested in fleet with the regulatory changes for engines in 2007 and 2009, so we've got a little bit of catch-up to do there. And then we've got investments that we need to make in the growth areas, particularly recycling and other diversion assets. And so while we're doing that, the CapEx is a little bit higher. Now we're not going to build out recycling assets forever. At some point in time, we're going to be done. We're not going to be -- there may be some new other types of diversions that we invest in the future, but we'll worry about those in the future. And so the 3 things that drive it are getting our cost programs in our yield to drive more cash generation and then ultimately having a lower CapEx after we've built up our fleet and spend the money for the diversion assets we need to spend.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "And when would you think the CapEx slows?", "David P. Steiner", "Well, we were roughly $1.3 billion last year. We're saying $1.4 billion this year. I certainly would expect that type of run rate, sort of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion for the next 2 years.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then lastly on your guidance, the bonus depreciation impact is assuming 50% or are you assuming that the President gets what he wants and it goes back to $100 million?", "David P. Steiner", "No. If goes back to $100 million, we'd cut that impact in half. So we think the impact will be about $100 million rather than the $200 million.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So there's a swing of $100 million in your free cash potential or is that 1 1 to 1 2?", "Steven Preston", "If there is a potential positive of $100 million over and above the guidance we gave, if the 100% bonus depreciation passes.", "David P. Steiner", "Frankly, Michael, if we get that additional $100 million in cash, we will likely invest it into the fleet to the last question to get there a little bit faster. And for us, investing in the fleet right now is a great thing because we can buy C&G trucks which, as you know, have a great return, great payback and obviously, are better for our customers.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "How big of a deal is that new engine that Cummins is coming out with in '13?", "David P. Steiner", "Boy, Michael, you're going to talk to us about engines? I'm not going to -- I don't want to comment on any particular company's technology. Obviously, we're working with all of our vendors to make sure that we can get not only a more environmentally friendly truck, but a more efficient truck from a weight point of view, from a productivity point of view.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. I was just curious if you thought it was a big -- it sounded big enough to wait for it, is what I'm hearing. Is it just keep buying and when it comes, if that's the right engine, you'll buy that one too.", "David P. Steiner", "We're certainly going to keep buying.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley.", "Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Could you comment specifically on the outlook for landfill pricing which is, perhaps, where you have the most control? Is this still one area where you can really put a stake in the ground and provide a target for the year in terms of pricing?", "David P. Steiner", "Yes. Vance, I'm glad you mentioned that because as you all know, landfill pricing has sort of been my quest for the last 3 years. And we actually just recently brought in -- actually, we will bring in Monday, so we haven't brought in, will bring in Monday a new gentlemen to run our pricing department, and it's going to be one of the first things that I sit down with him to discuss is how do we get more traction at the landfill? In the fourth quarter, when you look at it from a per unit basis, our MSW was up about 3.2% in yield. I think everybody's heard me say over the last few years that with the huge amount of capital that we have to put into landfills, we've got to get better pricing. And so I don't want to put a number around it quite yet because our new pricing director doesn't start until Monday, but you can bet that's going to be one of the first things that I sit down and talk with him about.", "Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. That's good to hear. And could you also provide an update on some of the JVs, whichever ones are worth mentioning, if it's Home Depot or Whole Foods, how are the initiatives coming along? Are they profitable? Will they be soon?", "David P. Steiner", "You mean JVs in terms of what?", "Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "So in other words, the Bagster and other stuff like that with Home Depot to get...", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, yes, yes. Bagster, we continue to see good growth in bags. I mean, obviously, this is the seasonal downturn for that because folks aren't doing a lot of home improvement projects during the winter months. But it's right on course where we wanted to be and it's a great product addition. I will tell you the other initiatives, the primary one they will look at is healthcare services and that's not going as fast as we'd like it to go, but I think 2012 is going to be a year where we really start to see the offering gain some traction, and we're certainly going to be very aggressive in going out and attracting that healthcare business.", "Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, great. Just one last question for me. I think on pricing gates, you had some in place for 2011. Are those lifted for 2012?", "David P. Steiner", "To the yield gate?", "Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Yes.", "David P. Steiner", "Yes. Yes, we actually lifted the yield gate last year and had yield as part of our overall compensation program. And this year, we've actually moved yield out of our compensation program. So we're going to get it through good old-fashioned elbow grease.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Corey Greendale with First Analysis.", "David Warner - First Analysis Corporation", "This is actually David Warner for Cory. I have a question, just to go back to commodity prices really quick. It looks like you're seeing or you're assuming the largest impact in commodity prices in Q1. I just wanted to get your thinking as to why you wouldn't see similar impacts in Q2 and Q3?", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, I think we're going to see commodity prices for the first half of the year continue. So you're right, we see the impact in Q1 more clearly because we're in the middle of it and we feel it's easier to estimate. We're hoping that we'll see that curve increase seasonally as we get into the year. If you look at the curve last year, prices kind of peaked in March and sort of stayed up at that level and kind of went up and down for a while. And we're expecting a more traditional increase in prices this year. So we think it's going to continue be a headwind. We just think it's going to compress a little bit relative to the curve last year.", "David Warner - First Analysis Corporation", "Okay. And one more. Just some of your thoughts on Veolia assets and what your acquisition outlook is for 2012.", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, when you look at acquisitions for 2012, as Steve said, we're looking sort of $150 million to $250 million in tuck-in acquisitions, recycling assets. That's sort of our typical run rate. We've said before that if we see opportunities, whether it's investment or acquisitions, that we always have the ability to manage our ability to do that through share repurchases, but we don't see any big acquisitions in the pipeline. Obviously there are a few, Veolia being the big one that folks are talking about. I think if there's one thing that our shareholders know about us is that we're going to be disciplined buyers. And I wouldn't see any reason to buy any solid waste company at a higher multiple than where we trade, because there's one company I know we can buy at a good multiple and that's our own. And so if we do get involved in any acquisitions, they will not be at numbers that would be above our own trading multiple.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Stewart Scharf with Standard & Poor's.", "Stewart Scharf - S&P Equity Research", "Most of my questions have been answered. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the trend rate and just how that's looking relative to last year.", "David P. Steiner", "It's a great point, because obviously, that has an effect on not so much on yield, but on overall profitability. And like I said before, we're seeing the rollbacks increase. We saw the churn rate increase a little bit. It was about 10.9% in the quarter, but it's been running slightly above 10% for the year. And so it is another effect that we have going into 2012 from a yield perspective, if you want to look at it that way. But the churn rate is slightly up, but nothing that will deter us from continuing our focus on yield management.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk with Wedbush.", "Albert Kaschalk", "Just to the recycling question again, I want to -- can you elaborate on what the mix of the material has changed or is changing or expected to change in '12, given the strong volume, which appears to be more than compensating for some of that price decline that's expected? In other words, are you seeing...", "David P. Steiner", "Higher price? The higher price mixed toward aluminum and other materials?", "Albert Kaschalk", "Well, I mean is 60%, 70% of the material fiber-related or is it less than 50%? What's the composition of the recycling material?", "David P. Steiner", "For us, it's not the composition of the recycling; it's what you do with the composition of the recycling, right? And so where we've been focused for the last year is when you get 5 returns in, they can be in a lot of different classes. They can range from very low price classes to very high price classes. And so where we've been focused is to sort of, if you will, tweak those recycling assets to move the lower-priced tons into higher-priced tons, right? And that has a marginal impact. I would tell you that in my mind, the mix issue in 2012 won't have a substantial impact. The big impact is going to be driven by volumes and commodity prices. And when you look at that, so you look at volumes year-to-year, they should get better from our new acquisitions but those new acquisitions take about 6 months of start-up mode before they turn profitable. And so you're not getting a lot of first half benefit from the new volumes. You start to get that benefit in the back half of the year both from volume and from price.", "Albert Kaschalk", "It seems like the -- what you laid out in terms of headwinds for '12 that we would be peaking in the headwind in the third quarter as opposed to the first quarter. So I think there's something more there that we're not hearing, but...", "David P. Steiner", "No. I think we peaked in the first quarter on the headwinds. It's sort of flat in the second quarter and then it turns better in the third quarter. So it certainly peaks in the first quarter. It's about the same in the second quarter, but obviously, as I mentioned, you've got the seasonal uptick in volumes, which makes up for some of that. And then the headwinds are very slight in the third quarter and then they actually turn slightly positive in the fourth quarter.", "Albert Kaschalk", "You mean from a volume respective right, David, because...", "David P. Steiner", "Now, from a -- just from an overall -- the 2 big headwinds are recycling and our waste-to-energy operations. And there's a number of issues that go in that. Obviously, commodity price is the biggest, new recycling, and then there's a number of factors in waste-to-energy. And so each of those factors turn either turn positive or they anniversary. For example, on our waste-to-energy plants where we have that South Florida contract, that anniversaries in August. And so they either become flat in the back half of the year or they turn positive. What we look at on commodity pricing is that they're going to continue to be a little bit below last year in the third quarter, but then they actually turn above last year in the fourth quarter. So again, you got a lot of headwinds in the first quarter, about the same a lot of headwinds in the second quarter, just a slight amount of headwinds in the third quarter and then flat to positive in the fourth quarter. And then combine that with the positive effects of yield in the back half of the year, obviously the uptick in volumes in the back half of the year and the uptick in yield in the back half of the year, and that's where you get the earnings growth in the back half of the year.", "Albert Kaschalk", "Okay. On Oakleaf, prior to your acquisition, you had a pretty big national accounts business. If I was thinking about the integration, it would seem that there would be some charges coming from that business. Is that something we should be anticipating coming down the road here?", "Steven Preston", "Those are really incorporated in the guidance that we gave. So we talked about benefits being the back half of the year and really negligible in the front half of the year. First quarter, we could see some pressure from that, but that's all integrated in there. And actually as we begin taking some of those costs, we already begin recognizing some of the other benefits of the transaction. So we'll probably have a little bit of pressure from it in the first quarter and that will probably go away in the second quarter by the time we get to the back half when we get to seeing net-net bottom line benefits.", "David P. Steiner", "So you might see a small restructuring charge in the first half of the year, obviously that we normally exclude from earnings, but it won't be a significant amount of money.", "Albert Kaschalk", "Okay. And then finally, if I may. If I look back over couple of years, right, we have relatively $3.3 billion of, I think, EBITDA give or take a little bit. And debts increased here quite a bit and you're comfortable, it sounds like, with a 60% debt-to-cap ratio, if I heard you right. But yet, EBITDA isn't really growing and free cash flow has been relatively stable. So there's a lot of moving parts in the economy, but what can help to provide some visibility or guidance here to that EBITDA growing relative to where it has been staying flat over the last several years?", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, I mean, first on 50% debt to cap, when you talk about stability, there's obviously a lot of positives to that stability even through the economic downturn, we continue to generate that $1.2 billion-plus of free cash. And so that's why we're very comfortable having a little higher debt balances than maybe some other companies that you look at. But as far as the EBITDA goes, it comes back to what I talked about earlier, which is we've absolutely got to drive EBITDA through continued focus on our cost programs and managing yield. And then as volumes start to improve, we've got a very high fixed cost base. So as the volumes start to improve, obviously, you've got great incremental margins at the landfill and you've got very good incremental margins on the collection line of business. So we've got to -- we want to see that growth, it's why I keep talking about the commercial line of business and the MSW volumes at the landfill, because those are 2 of our highest margin, highest contribution lines of business. And as you see the volumes start to improve there, that's when you start to see the leverage of this business take off.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to David Steiner for any closing remarks.", "David P. Steiner", "Well thank you, all. We certainly think that we had a very solid fourth quarter and finished off a very good 2011. We look forward to continued growth in 2012 and we look forward to seeing all of you all as we travel on the road during the year, so thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you for participating in today's fourth quarter and year-end 2011 earnings release conference call.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. With me this morning are David Steiner, Chief Executive Officer; Steve Preston, Executive Vice President of Finance, Recycling and Energy Services; Jim Fish, newly appointed Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Trevathan, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. David will start things off with a summary of the financial results for the quarter. Steve will cover our revenue growth, including price and volume trends, operating costs and the financial statements. David and Jim will then discuss the restructuring plan announced today. We'll conclude with questions and answers. During their statements, any comparisons, unless otherwise stated, will be with the second quarter of 2011.", "Before we get started, let me remind you that in addition to our earnings press release and the press release announcing our restructuring plan that were issued this morning, we have filed a Form 8-K that includes the earnings press release as Exhibit 99.1 and is available on our website at www.wm.com.

Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in today's press releases and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Form 10-K.  Additionally, during the call, David and Steve will discuss our earnings per diluted share, which they may refer to as EPS or earnings per share, on an \"as adjusted\" basis.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the express written consent of Waste Management is prohibited.", "Now I turn the call over to Waste Management's CEO, David Steiner.", "David P. Steiner", "Hey, Ted, and good morning from Houston. In the second quarter of 2012, we earned $0.52 per share, a 4% increase when compared to the second quarter of 2011, as we grew both our revenue and our net income. Our core solid waste business continues to perform well as the combined income from operations for our collection, landfill and transfer station business grew 3.4%, and margins in our core business expanded by 60 basis points. Our core solid waste business has seen steady improvement, and we expect that to accelerate into 2013 as a result of our current restructuring and our field-based initiatives. We also saw a second consecutive quarter of volume growth in our core solid waste business.", "So our core business continues to perform well, but the overall company performance was dragged down by $0.07 per share of headwinds, primarily related to declining commodity prices. Internal revenue growth from volumes was positive in the second quarter and has shown good stability over the first 6 months of the year. We saw positive volume growth in each of our industrial, special waste and recycling operations. Our residential business was still negative, but the rate of decline has improved each of the last 6 quarters. We'd like to see more consistent growth in our MSW and Commercial business, however, our volumes in those lines are trending pretty much as we expected. As such, we still expect to achieve our full-year volume guidance of flat to slightly positive, with the most likely scenario having volume slightly positive for the full year.", "Looking at our IRG from yield in the second quarter of 2012, each of our collection, landfill and transfer station lines of business saw positive yield. Both Special Waste and roll-off achieved positive yield and positive volume. So we're maintaining our pricing discipline, but we're certainly not satisfied with yield at 1%. Just like we did in the past, in order to take the mix effects out of our yield calculation, we also analyzed core price increases or increases on current customers. Core pricing is basically price increases plus all fees other than our fuel surcharge, less all price rollbacks. When we look at the core price component of solid waste yield it increased 2.8%, which was similar to last year. Average recycling commodity prices were 20% lower during the second quarter when compared to the second quarter of 2011. This resulted in approximately a $0.03 decline in our earnings per share for the second quarter of 2012. Through the first quarter, we saw commodity prices rise like we expected. However, as we moved into the second quarter, the rise in commodity prices stalled and actually began to decline. So we saw a negative $0.06 EPS effect from recycling commodity prices for the first half of the year, which was slightly worse than we expected.", "For the second half of the year, we originally expected no negative effect from commodity prices, but given current prices and our future outlook that prediction is no longer valid. We now project that for the second half of the year, recycling commodity prices will be slightly lower and will have a negative year-over-year impact on earnings per share of approximately $0.05. However, volumes continue to grow as customers continue to demand more recycling services. We've invested in recycling assets in the past and will continue to do so in the future.", "Turning to our Waste-to-Energy business, average electricity pricing declined a little more than 10% in the second quarter when compared to the second quarter of 2011. We experienced headwinds in the second quarter of 2012 from rollbacks on tip fees in our South Florida waste-to-energy business, as well as low electricity pricing. These drove a $0.03 drag on earnings per share for the second quarter compared to the second quarter of 2011. We now expect to see a negative $0.02 per share impact from our waste-to-energy operations during the second half of 2012, which is slightly higher than our original estimate of a negative $0.01 per share impact in the back half of 2012.", "In summary, through the first half of 2012, we were happy to see that our core solid waste business has grown and margins have continued to improve. This has helped us grow adjusted earnings per share year-over-year despite larger-than-anticipated headwinds from recycling, waste-to-energy and fuel commodity prices.", "In the third and fourth quarters, we anticipate seeing benefits from procurement savings, the integration of our acquired Oakleaf operations and reorganization savings, which will help to offset the additional $0.03 of commodities headwinds we experienced in the first half of the year. However, we also expect to see the continued decline of recycling commodity prices and a negative impact from our Waste-to-Energy business in the second half of the year. Consequently, the unexpected $0.07 of headwinds in the second half of the year have made us more conservative on our full-year adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance. We now see our full year being between $2.15 and $2.20 per diluted share. So we expect our core solid waste business to continue to perform pretty much as we expected at the beginning of the year. The change in our guidance is not driven by core operations, but is driven by our expectation that commodity prices will be lower in the second half of the year. Of course, commodity prices are inherently unpredictable and with recycling commodity dependent on both domestic and foreign markets, we've seen a fair amount of volatility just in the first 6 months of the year. So although we expect to see a $0.07 year-over-year decline in EPS in the back half of the year, that number is merely a current prediction of future commodity markets. As such, it could change if markets improve or deteriorate beyond our current expectations. Consequently, if commodity prices have a different effect on earnings than our predicted $0.07 per share, our outlook would obviously adjust accordingly, either positively or negatively.", "Finally, as this is Steve's last earnings call, I'd like to thank him for his partnership. Of course, he'll be with us for the next few months helping with the Oakleaf integration and working with me on other projects, and he's leaving the finance organization in terrific shape for Jim.", "I'll now turn the call over to Steve to discuss our second quarter results in more detail.", "Steven C. Preston", "Thank you, David. I'm going to begin by talking about revenue drivers, including yield and volume in the various lines of business. And then I'll get into a discussion of our costs and our cash flow. Revenue for the second quarter increased $112 million or 3.3% from the prior-year period. This is the 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. While our revenue improvement was largely driven by acquisitions, primarily Oakleaf, as David mentioned, we also saw positive internal revenue growth from both yield and volume. Some of that growth was offset by a significant decrease in revenue from lower commodity pricing. Yield in our collection disposal operations grew 0.6% in the second quarter, but adjusted for the change in pricing at our waste-to-energy plants in South Florida, our yield growth for the second quarter of 2012 was 1.0%.", "In the collection business, yield grew 1% in the second quarter. More specifically, commercial grew 1.4%, industrial grew 1.7% and residential grew 0.2%. In the landfill line of business, all the main waste streams achieved positive yield in the second quarter of 2012. Overall, landfill yield was a positive 1.4%, which is the highest yield we've seen since the first quarter of 2011. MSW yield grew 1.2%. In addition, C&D yield improved 1.7% and special waste yield was a positive 1.9%. Internal volume growth was 0.6%, which is a slight improvement from the work day adjusted volumes that we saw in the first quarter of 2012. But more importantly, this is the first time we've seen 2 consecutive quarters of volume growth since the second and third quarters of 2005. This growth was driven by landfill volumes, which grew 1.3%. And while MSW waste stream declined 0.7% and C&D volume declined 1.6%, other lines, driven by Special Waste, grew 2.0 -- 2.8%, rather, and that is what supported the overall volume growth. Landfill volume growth was particularly -- was partially offset by collection volumes, which declined 0.4%. More specifically, collection volumes declined 2.9% in commercial and 0.6% in residential. In the industrial business, volumes grew 1.8%.", "In addition, recycling volumes improved 1.1% organically in the quarter and 11.5% when you include acquisitions. Of course, commodity prices were down in the quarter, but we do remain committed to the recycling line of business, as David mentioned. With improved internal growth from both yield and volume, income from operations in the combined collection, landfill and transfer station businesses improved more than 3% when compared with the second quarter of 2011, and operating margins improved 60 basis points.", "Operating costs increased $110 million in the second quarter to 65% of revenue compared to 63.9% in the second quarter of 2011. The largest driver was subcontractor costs, which increased $98 million, primarily related to the addition of Oakleaf, which delivers most of its services through third parties. The remaining $12 million of increase consists of labor costs increasing due to acquisitions as well as new recycling plant startups. We also saw higher prices in our cost of tires and parts and lubricants, but these increases were partially offset by savings from lower cost of goods sold due to lower commodity prices, as well as cost savings in the landfill operating cost and risk management areas.", "SG&A costs were $372 million in the second quarter, which was an improvement of $10 million. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A costs improved 60 basis points. The main drivers of the improvement in SG&A costs were reduction in consulting fees as well as incentive compensation accruals.", "So as we pull apart the various items affecting margins, we need to dig a bit further into the various lines of business. So our core collection and disposal lines expanded margins significantly. That contributed 60 basis points of improvement to the overall margin of the company. And SG&A savings added an additional 60 basis points of improvement. However, the recycling and waste-to-energy headwinds that David mentioned, reduced margins 120 basis points, and our acquisition of Oakleaf further reduced margins 70 basis points. And then fuel impacted margins negatively by an additional 10 basis points. So as a result, our core business margins improved 60 basis points, but our overall income from operations declined 30 basis points when compared to the second quarter of 2011.", "Updating our initiative progress during the second quarter of 2012, our procurement program delivered $0.02 of earnings per share, which helped offset costs incurred to rollout our routing and logistics programs. At the end of the second quarter, our weighted average cost of debt was 5.1% and our debt-to-capital ratio was 60.2%. Our floating rate portion of total debt -- of the total bit [ph] debt portfolio was 10% at the end of the quarter. Our income tax rate as reported in the second quarter of 2012 was 34.3%, largely in line with the rate of 34.5% in 2011.", "Turning now to cash flow. Second quarter 2012 net cash provided from operating activities was $669 million. This is an increase of $191 million from the second quarter of 2011. The increase is primarily related to improved working capital, which includes the impact of terminating certain interest rate swaps. Some of that increase also relates to the timing of tax payments and interest, which should even out over the next 3 quarters.", "Our capital expenditures for the second quarter were $351 million, resulting in free cash flow for the quarter of $332 million. Free cash flow improved $126 million when compared to the second quarter of 2011. And as the year progresses, we still expect to generate between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion of free cash flow for the year, and we expect to divest certain noncore assets to help offset higher CapEx and higher cash taxes anticipated in 2012 compared to 2011.", "We returned $165 million to our shareholders to the second quarter -- to the second quarter dividend and we invested $25 million in acquisitions.", "As I close, as David mentioned, I will be turning over the CFO reins to Jim Fish, and continuing to work on the Oakleaf integration, as well as selected project. I have to say, I leave this role with a smile on my face not only because my brief time here at Waste Management has been so fulfilling, but also because I'm confident that there are many great things in store for this company.", "Now I'd like to turn it back over to David and Jim Fish to discuss the changes in our organizational structure.", "David P. Steiner", "Thanks, Steve. As you all know, we've been investing in a number of initiatives to streamline our organization and to get closer to our customers. Today, we took a big step in our efforts to streamline our operations, and we consolidated a reporting layer to move field operations closer to our corporate initiatives. We're focused on 3 areas of our business: improving our yield; improving the efficiency of our operations; and getting closer to our customers through our segmentation efforts. The restructuring is designed to improve the implementation of these initiatives by creating a direct line of communications between the field and the corporate staff. And by the way, most of the corporate leaders of these initiatives are people that came out of our field operations, so we expect to have more alignment and quicker reaction time as we implement our strategies. Certainly, the actions we're taking will move more responsibility to our Area Vice Presidents and their staff.", "Our new structure is designed to drive performance and accountability from the Area Vice Presidents to our 2 new SVPs of field operations, Jeff Harris and John Morris. Consequently, there will be a heightened level of accountability for our Area Vice Presidents for all aspects of performance, from yield and volume, to implementation of our initiatives. So the reorganization should not only save money in the short term, but it should also lead to improved performance over the long term. We now have our 17 best leaders running our area operations, supported by a talented and efficient staff. I have complete confidence in the people that will lead our operations and our support functions and look forward to working closely with them to achieve our goals. Our new senior leaders are ideal for the new roles. Jim Trevathan has been at Waste Management for over 30 years, and has served in roles ranging from sales to operations. Aligning the 2 field SVPs with Jim is a natural extension of his current role, which includes responsibility for our field-based initiatives, like service delivery optimization and customer-focused growth. Jeff Harris has been in our company for over 12 years, and in the industry for 30 years. Jeff has run operations from New York to Canada and most recently served as the head of our Midwestern group, which has been our top performing group. Going forward, Jeff will manage the areas in the former Midwest group and will add operations on the east and west coast. John Morris has been at Waste Management for 15 years and in the industry for nearly 20 years. John has extensive experience in field operations, and for the last 5 months served the company as Chief Strategy Officer. John has long been recognized as one of our top performers and has all the experience and capabilities to take on the role. John will manage the more southern areas of our company, stretching from California to Florida. Through the restructuring we've created a number of other opportunities at all levels of the organization, and I know our people will excel in their new roles. So we head towards 2013 with renewed energy and commitment to our strategy.", "With that, I'll let Jim Fish go over the reorganization in more detail.", "James C. Fish", "Thanks, David. As I mentioned 3 weeks ago when we announced my new role, I come to the CFO position with a field-based operational focus. When I discussed the new role with David, I told him the areas I'd like to focus on, were growing the business, reducing its cost structure and efficiently allocating capital to increase our returns. Today, we announced a plan to streamline the organization and reduce SG&A costs. We have been analyzing the cost structure and staffing requirements needed to support our front-line personnel and our long-term strategies. We will continue to focus on reducing costs through our procurement efforts and our technological improvements in routing and logistics. We specifically designed this restructuring with the primary goals of streamlining our delivery of corporate support, while not disrupting our front-line operations. More than 90% of the cost reduction is expected to come from corporates and support functions.", "Going forward, I will be helping to design and implement the programs to achieve our goal of an additional 200 to 300 basis points of cost reductions. Not only are we taking action to remove cost, but the reorganization is designed to improve alignment between our corporate initiatives and a field implementation of those initiatives. We now have a direct line of communication between the corporate support teams and the areas that are responsible for executing on the strategies. A simpler and flatter organization will not only have lower SG&A costs, but also should result in sharper focus as we identify and execute upon our opportunities and deliver the value to our shareholders. Clearly, this reorganization is designed to save money in the short term, but our goal is to drive improved performance in the longer term as well.", "Overall, the reorganization is anticipated to eliminate approximately 700 positions. This includes the elimination of a layer of management consisting of our 4 geographic groups. In addition, we've made significant reductions in our corporate office. We are also reducing the number of our areas from 22 down to 17. A year ago, we had 25 areas.", "The company anticipates a third quarter pretax charge to earnings in the range of $50 million to $60 million, primarily from employee related costs. The charges does not include facility lease or other charges that cannot be estimated today but that we will likely incur as we move forward. The cost savings from the reorganization will occur over time, with a small amount anticipated in 2012, but with an anticipated savings of over $130 million annually in 2013. We will monitor our results by tracking headcount and associated benefits and costs, and we will track other expense categories, such as consulting fees, to make sure we don't merely replace employee costs with third-party costs. So we are going to work for the remainder of the year to position the company to get the full benefits of the reorganization in 2013 with no backtracking.", "Taking these costs out is the equivalent of a downpayment. We're still on target for the implementation of routing and logistics and with the increased efficiencies created from the reorganization. We will be able to move forward more quickly into centralization of additional back-office functions. Over time, this should allow us to achieve an additional 200 to 300 basis point improvement that we are targeting.", "And with that, operator, we can open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley.", "Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I may have missed it, but could you provide the dollar amount of the environmental fees in the quarter, and can you comment, maybe, on what the expectation is for environmental fees in the third quarter? I'm just wondering the impact that has on pricing.", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, we had about just a little bit over $80 million of environmental fee in the second quarter. I wouldn't expect that number to go down in the third quarter. Remember, last year in August, we raised the environmental fee from 7.5% to 10%, and so you've got the anniversary-ing of that this year, but I wouldn't expect that number -- it's been very consistently around $80 million since mid last year.", "Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, that's very helpful. And could you also provide a feel for the pace of residential contracts rolling off? Is there an accelerated pace starting this month and continuing into the fall? Just trying to, again, gauge the impact there.", "David P. Steiner", "From a pricing perspective?", "Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Sure.", "David P. Steiner", "Yes. So what we've got in the back half of the year for CPI on our contracts is roughly 2%. And so it's 1.5%, 2%, Ed, as I recall it, and so that's what we're counting on for the back half of the year.", "Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, great. And just one more real quick question. On the noncore asset liquidations, can you tell us anything about what that relates to?", "David P. Steiner", "Pardon me?", "Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "On the noncore asset liquidations, can you tell us what the noncore assets were?", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, absolutely. As you all know, we've had a lot of different investments in energy. We've made some investments in energy assets to offset fuel costs. And so those are pretty valuable assets and we'll look to monetize some of them.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Just a follow-up on the sale of noncore assets, if you've kept the free cash flow guidance at $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion, if you take a look out and exclude potential or what they're contributing today, what does free cash flow look like?", "David P. Steiner", "What the noncore assets are contributing today?", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Well, David, you're in the process of restructuring again and trying to get the run rate on free cash flow for the business. And you certainly lowered EPS for the commodity headwinds that are out there, but it didn't seem like there was a drop down in free cash flow and I would think with sale of some of these assets, I've got to believe they're contributing some cash to the business today.", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, they're contributing some cash. But in the back half of the year -- Steve may remember -- as I recall in the back half of the year, that would be around $20 million. So not a huge amount for the back half of the year.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "But going forward on a pro forma basis for the business, I mean, is it $100 million or what are we...", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, so what we've got going on here is we've got these energy assets that as you drill out -- so we're spending capital to drill out these assets, too. So as they continue to produce, you continue to drill out. So you've got 2 things going on. You've got capital going out, you've got some income coming in. So net-net from a cash flow point of view, even given the earnings that you would lose on the current production, you would pick up cash, because as we sell the assets, we'd have less of a capital commitment. So net-net going into 2013, that should actually be a positive contributor to free cash flow.", "Steven C. Preston", "And you'll see it coming through that -- a lower CapEx line just to take forward a little bit of what David said.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. With these restructurings, some new hires or a replacement now, having a COO. 2 questions: First, do you anticipate some potential goodwill impairment? I assume some of this headcount reduction, 700, has to be coming from Oakleaf operation. And then secondly, could you touch on why the change in strategy or philosophy on getting back in place a COO. I think some of us have our own views on that, but would welcome the opportunity to hear you.", "David P. Steiner", "So the 700 includes nothing from Oakleaf. And the 700, by the way, includes nothing from the consolidation of our former National Accounts into Oakleaf. It's completely and absolutely 100% separate from Oakleaf. No, there won't be and we don't anticipate any type of goodwill write-off from the Oakleaf operations. When you talk about the COO role, we brought Jim in here now -- what, Jim? A little over a year ago to basically take all of our field-based initiatives -- look, Jim, as I think one of you all very appropriately said, Jim is an operator's operator. Jim's been in this industry a long time. Jim's forgotten more about this industry than I'll ever know. So we brought him in here about a year ago in order to drive the big corporate initiatives we had going on, primarily service delivery optimization and customer-focused growth. So as you take out these 4 geographic groups, the layer of management and you're left with 2 operators, those 2 operators need some support staff. Those folks out in the group weren't doing nothing, they were doing a lot of things to help those folks manage their business. So they're going to need some staff to help them out. And by the way, they're going to be here in Houston. And so it made perfect sense to have them align themselves with Jim's corporate staff to provide the support they need to manage those lines of business. And so it made absolutely perfect sense. If you're really going to try to drive these initiatives in the field, why wouldn't you have the person that's responsible for the corporate support functions for those initiatives also have the folks that are responsible for the implementation in the field of those initiatives. And so it made absolute perfect sense to have them all reporting to Jim, and I'm absolutely confident you're going to start to see them drive some real savings into the business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bill Fisher with Raymond James.", "William H. Fisher - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Just wanted to follow-up on -- or a question on the pricing. On the outlook for the second half in terms of your guidance, can you touch on the factors that impact whether it moves up or is constant like the anniversary-ing of the environmental fee and the CPI and whatnot?", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, it's a great point. I do see it sort of remaining constant in the back half of the year. We do have the anniversary of the environmental fee coming up. We've got some benefit coming from the CPI increases. But as you all know, earlier in the year, we renewed a lot of contracts at lower rates, so that affects it a little bit. But what we're seeing, frankly, in pricing are a lot of positive signs. We're seeing the volume firm, we're seeing net service increases pick up. And so from my perspective, it's time for us to get a little bit more aggressive on new business pricing. And so that doesn't hit yield on the bottom line overnight, but moving into 2013, you should see our yield pick up from its current 1%.", "William H. Fisher - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And just on Oakleaf, how far along are you in the process of -- on the third-party haulers either using your landfill or potentially bringing some of that volume in-house?", "Steven C. Preston", "Yes, we've actually -- we've made a lot of really good progress in the last quarter. And I think on the last earnings release call we mentioned that, that second quarter was going to be an important time for us to advance our negotiations with the vendors. So we made good progress really at the top of list when you think about how we're sequencing this, at the top of the list are the larger regional and sort of multiregional providers. They've got the most volume and negotiating with them moves the needle most quickly because you can get at them a lot more easily. And we've gotten through most of those negotiations and feel pretty good about it, and that probably gets us about 2/3 of the way to our EBIT run rate. Now we're beginning to -- we're sort of concluding those discussions and jumping into discussions with the smaller vendors. That takes more time, because the volume is smaller, and as a result there are a lot more out there, but there's still a tremendous amount of opportunity in that chunk of providers. So our integration team is pretty optimistic that we're going to hit our run rate. It's probably going to move somewhat into the first quarter of next year. We hope to hit it really kind of Jan 1. I think it's probably going to move to February, but we'll have a lot of it going into January 1. So from that perspective, it's been a pretty good quarter for us.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Dave, the first question is just on your CPI exposure. Maybe if you can help us think about how much of your business resets each year. Is it different this year versus last year in terms of how much resets? You can give a dollar amount or talk about it qualitatively -- however you want. And then also maybe just update us on your churn rate.", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, the churn rate, first off, actually dropped in the quarter to 9.6%. And Hamzah, as you know, with the CPI-based revenue, it rolls off in January and July. About 7% of our revenue will be repriced in the back half of the year. As I said, that's about 2% CPI.", "Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Got you. And then, Dave, maybe if you could -- you've made a lot of management changes, clearly this year. All of them have been internal. Maybe if you could just talk about why you didn't do this earlier, maybe also touch on is there any disruption to the operations with the management changes? Is it a pretty smooth transition? How should people be thinking about all these management changes?", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, I think it's a great question, Hamzah, and I'm glad you asked it. Because when I joined this company, I think we had 110 areas. And when you have 110 areas, you have absolutely no choice but to have an intervening layer to manage those 110 areas. And so you've seen us drop those areas from 110 down to 25 at the beginning of this year, and now we've dropped them down to 17. And so when you look at what we did, it's frankly, it's the culmination of what we've been doing now for the last 6 years, right? It's basically we've been consolidating the structure below the group level, so that at some point in time, we'd be able to take out that group level and have a direct -- report directly to corporate. And to the second question, look, whenever you do something like this, it is the first and only question you ask yourself the whole time, which is, can we get this done without affecting our front-line operations? And I will tell you if there has been one theme to this reorganization, it has been, let's make sure that we get this done without affecting front-line operations. So as Jim pointed out, 90% of the cost savings are going to come from support functions above the district pool where our operations occur. And so we made sure that when we did that, that we could cover those functions. I'll just give you a quick example. Our view of it was, take accounting, for example. We had an accounting structure in our corporate -- in our corporate group structure, right? We also have accounting in our corporate structure here in Houston, and we have a big accounting structure in the areas at that time, each of the 22 areas. And so we said, look, if we have that much support from an accounting point of view, both at the area and at corporate, do we really need that group-based accounting support? And so we took a very logical approach to say, if there is a lot of support for that function in the area and in corporate, we would be able to either eliminate that function at the group level or at least consolidate down from 4 in each of the groups to a fewer number. So we took a very methodical approach to making sure that everything we did not only didn't disrupt our delivery operations, but it didn't disrupt our corporate operations.", "Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just a last question from me, does the restructuring plan change any of your SG&A targets going forward? Or how should we think about -- you guys had SG&A target out there, I don't remember when, but does this change that thinking, can you update us on that?", "David P. Steiner", "Yes -- no, it doesn't change the thinking at all. Our ultimate target is 9% or below for SG&A. Obviously, this takes 100 basis points out of that, but we're still too high. Anyone that looks at this business knows that we're still too high. And so the second phase is to make sure that we can start consolidating some of those back-office functions that drives SG&A down further. Now that's going to take a couple of years for us to do that. In the meantime, we're going to be focused on operating costs through our efficiency and routing programs.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Scott Levine with JPMorgan.", "Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So with regard firstly to the guidance, it looks like you're lowering $0.07 for incremental commodity headwinds in the back half, and the midpoint of your EPS guidance is coming down like $0.085. So is it right to think that with the exception of the commodity deterioration that the remainder of your outlook for the business is effectively intact with what it was at the beginning of the year? Or have there been any other puts and takes from your perspective impacting your guidance change?", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, I think that's absolutely correct, Scott. I think you hit the nail on the head. And when we look at it, the core business again is operating just fine. And when we look at the full year, it's not just about the $0.07 in the back half of the year, but we're $0.03 to the negative in the first half of the year from Commodities and recycling and waste-to-energy. So we've got to make up that $0.03 in the back half of the year while fighting that $0.07 of headwinds. And so, look, we thought it was a little bit -- we thought it was appropriate to get a little bit more conservative on the guidance. And we're going to overcome that $0.03 of headwinds by all the programs that we've been talking about in the back half of the year.", "Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Got it, that's helpful. And then a point of clarification on the free cash flow. So good quarter, but still well below 50% of the way to your target for this year. What gives you the confidence you can still hit that $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion? And then as a follow-up to that, is there a certain amount of divestiture proceeds from the divestiture program that's included in the $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion target?", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, we've got a couple of divestitures that we're working on, but we've been working on them for quite a while, so it's not uncertain that those will happen. The noncore assets are the primary driver of the cash flow in the back half of the year.", "Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And how much is that additive to the -- in the 1 point, how much is embedded within the $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion for assets proceeds?", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, if you look at the schedules to our press release, we've said that likely around $250 million would be the minimum number that we'd sell.", "Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "$250 million, got it. Okay, and then maybe lastly, in terms of uses of cash, so no buyback activity in the quarter. Are you still committed to your target for this year, should we be thinking about lower numbers? Is the M&A pipeline more active? How should we think about cash flow deployment?", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, as we said last quarter, we wanted to -- we've frontloaded a lot of our purchasing decisions for capital expenditures this year to buy CNG trucks. And so we wanted to see how the first half of the year played out before we made any commitments for our free cash flow. Our capital deployment strategy hasn't changed at all. If we can find good accretive investments at this point in time, I think it's more likely -- well, I won't say it's more likely. At this point in time, I will tell you, we're not looking for noncore investments. We're either going to buy solid waste tuck-ins or recycling facilities. If we can find good targets in that arena, we spend that cash, if not, then we're going to return it to our shareholders.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Wunderlich Securities.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "On the free cash flow, if we could go back to that table you referred to that said Cash Flow Reconciliation (b). One of the adjustments as you go from a cash from ops from $2.450 million to $2.300 million. Can you talk through what's in that $150 million change, so we can understand how much of that might be working capital versus net income and get a better feel for where that ends up? Is there a restructuring, for instance in that, from a cash standpoint?", "Steven C. Preston", "Why don't I jump in. We've got a number of kind of chunks in this, if you want to call it that. If you remember, with the elimination of bonus depreciation or 100% bonus depreciation coming into this year, we've got a fairly significant increase in the amount of taxes, cash taxes we pay this year relative to last year. And that's a fairly significant item. And then the other issue, as David mentioned, we are trending somewhat higher on CapEx. Some of that is going to higher fleet purchases, as well as some investment to the growth assets, which are being offset in large part with the divestitures. So it's really, Michael, it's mostly around trying to predict those moving pieces which are fairly chunky and really not having to do with the underlying kind of cash generation of building the business.", "David P. Steiner", "And the restructuring, Michael, is not included in those numbers. As I recall of the charge, I think we're saying about 40% of it will be cash out this year and the rest will be cash out next year.", "Steven C. Preston", "Sort of $20 million to $25 million, so it's not really a significant number.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "All right. But if I could drill in a little bit, Steve, in your prior guidance, you assumed your cash from -- provided from operating activities would be $2.450 billion. You've now lowered that to $2.300 billion. What is in that $150 million? That's the cash taxes now are higher, is that what I'm hearing? So cash taxes are materially different than what you had estimated because of the bonus depreciation? What else is in that, that causes that $150 million?", "Steven C. Preston", "So we've -- I'm sorry, Michael, what bridge are you looking for again? I know, for example...", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "On Page 11, well, I think it's Page 11. It's your table called Full Year 2012 Free Cash Flow Reconciliation (b), and you have the Scenario 1 and 2...", "David P. Steiner", "I think primarily what you've got going on there is working capital and then don't forget the $0.07 of earnings that comes out of -- that's another $50 million.", "Steven C. Preston", "That's true, that's true.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Because what I'm trying to get a feel for is, I think, structurally, there's about $950 million to $1 billion of cash from the core business. And that's going to get better because you're taking $130 million in cost saves, or maybe it's up to $150 million if you count '12's impact in '13. So that's what I'm trying to get a feel for is that I've got a step back, but I got a visible step forward is what I'm trying to understand.", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, so what you've got going on this year, Michael, is CapEx up and cash taxes dramatically up, right? And so next year, when we go to put together our budget for next year, we're going to take all of that into account to generate the cash that we need to generate. This is not a business that is -- what we're saying is this is not a business that systemically produces $950 million to $1 billion of free cash. The number is higher than that, and we're going to manage it to make sure that we keep it there.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then one of the investments you have been making is in the recycling side. And admittedly, it's added volatility to the model, but it's high returns at a certain price. What price of the commodity does that investing either get pulled back or stop?", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, when we look at our models, we assume average 5-year pricing. And frankly, that's about where prices are right now. It's about at average 5 years. At average 5 year, they're very accretive to return on capital, and I don't remember what percentage below it. But frankly, I don't remember the percentage below it has to go in order for it to not be. But I'm just going to think off the top of my head here, Michael, thinking back into the models. I would guess that you have to see an additional 20% plus decrease in pricing before you get there. And I'm saying that just because our models are generally in the 20% range at average 5-year pricing. So you'd have to come back down 20% to 30% in order to get it down to below the 15% IRR that we generally look at.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then as part of the restructuring, are you eliminating the old silo structure as well? Is that one of the other actions that's happening?", "David P. Steiner", "Yes. So I mean, you're exactly right. What we're doing here is we're getting everything aligned around 3 people frankly: It's Jim Trevathan and those 2 Senior Vice Presidents of Field Operations.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then lastly, if the business environment you have right now existed in 2013, how would you describe your outlook for '13?", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, Michael, I got to tell you, we see a heck of a lot of encouraging signs in this business. You see the volumes for us being pretty stable, and we expect that to continue. We're going to take out this $130 million of costs. That's obviously a real accelerator going in. As Steve mentioned, you've got Oakleaf going sort of from the $50 million run rate to the $80 million run rate in 2013. Commodity prices again are going to be a big wild card, but you would hope that you won't see any further deterioration in that. The one thing that we've got to get laser focused on in 2013 is yield. I mean, look, that's where the dollars drop to the bottom line. And I will tell you that if the business environment stays like the way it is today, and what I mean by that, is if we continue to see positive volume, we're going to have to get more aggressive on price. Look, you all know the model. Back in 2007, we were losing volume, but we were getting a heck of lot of yield and we were seeing our margins expand handsomely. We've got to get back to that model. Now the whole thing that we've been working on for the last 2 years is to get back to that model, but get back without giving up volume for price. So we got to do a better job on yield in 2013.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.", "Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So most of my questions have been asked already, but I just had a couple points of clarification. Just to be clear on the free cash flow guidance, have you changed your CapEx guidance for the year at all? Is it still at $1.4 billion?", "Steven C. Preston", "Well, if you look at the table on Page 9, the CapEx guidance is $1.450 billion to $1.6 billion and I think that's up slightly from last quarter. Last quarter I think we were out there with $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. That's part of the bridge that we were kind of working through with Michael.", "Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then talking specifically about just your -- the guidance change on the EPS side. Obviously, you've highlighted the change in commodity prices. Just to be clear though, this doesn't include the $0.07 charges that you took this quarter nor does it include the $0.08 in restructuring for next quarter or the facility closures, correct?", "David P. Steiner", "That's correct.", "Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then on the facility closures, at this point you've yet to quantify it, but you have quantified the restructuring costs. So help me understand that a little bit more clearly.", "David P. Steiner", "Sure. When you think about it, when we do this restructuring, just take the easy example is the group offices. Are we going to continue to need those group offices? Now we haven't even started talking to a landlord about subleasing that space or anything of the sort like that, we're going to start that process right now. So my guess is that we'll find a lot of consolidation opportunities. But we just can't estimate if those are going to generate a charge or not. And so we just want to let you know it's probably coming, but we can't estimate the amount.", "Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And I guess one last question. I haven't covered you guys for all that long, but for the year or so that I have, it feels like we've been taking restructuring charges every quarter. I guess for each of the last 4 quarters and then going into next quarter. With the changes that you're making today, do you feel like for the foreseeable future we're going to be through the restructuring charges once we get through the third quarter? Or is this something that could kind of prolong into next year?", "David P. Steiner", "No, you should see it through in the third quarter. So it's a great point. What you've seen from a restructuring point of view -- remember what Jim mentioned about where we've come from. We started out the year with 25 areas, we went to 22, now we're at 17. The restructuring charges that you've seen in the prior quarters were essentially related to the prelude to the big restructuring. The moving of the 25 to 22 areas, and so that was the prelude to the big restructuring we're doing today. Could you see some charges, as we said, from lease consolidations and things like that? Yes. But the bulk of it will all occur in the third quarter.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from the line of Cory Greendale with First Analysis.", "David Warner - First Analysis Corporation", "This is David Warner for Cory. Most of my questions have been answered, but I was wondering if you could speak to the impact on your ability to strategically push through price increases now that the management structure seems to become more centralized and you've eliminated some of these -- the regional or geographic management layer?", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, it's a great point. And again with pricing just like I talked about the other departments, we did the same thing with pricing. Which is we said, okay, do we have a lot of pricing support out in the field and do we have a lot of pricing support in corporate? And if we do, we can eliminate that intervening layer. If we don't, then we're going to have to do something. So when we looked at our infrastructure for pricing, both out in our areas and in our corporate offices, we have a lot of pricing infrastructure. The reality is, in order to drive that price, it had to go from corporate to group to the area. Now it doesn't. No it's going to go straight from the corporate office to the areas. And so when I talk about accountability for our area and AVPs, that's exactly what we're talking about. There's no longer going to be accountability to somebody out in the field that then has to have accountability to someone here in corporate. There's going to be accountability to Jim Fish, Jim Trevathan, John Morris, Jeff Harris and me. And every quarter, we're going to sit in front of them and say, \"Are you implementing the yield programs that we want you to implement?\" rather than having that filter between us and them. So, I'm truly excited that it'll make us a much more nimble and efficient company, and I think it'll do that not only pricing, but in all of our initiatives.", "David Warner - First Analysis Corporation", "Okay. And one more thing, do you expect that 100 basis point benefit from the restructuring to be spread evenly over 2013 or front-half loaded or back-half loaded or what there?", "David P. Steiner", "No, that will hit day 1. We will be through everything we need to be through by January 1. That $130 million will hit day 1 through January -- through 2013.", "Thank you, all for joining the call. It's been an interesting time for Waste Management. We certainly have a lot of very talented people that are not going to be with our organization, and I will tell you I'm going to miss them both from a professional point of view and from a personal point of view. As someone said during this process, if anyone thinks this is easy, they've never done it before. It's not easy, but it's something we have to do for the viability of our business. And we look forward to generating some excitement and some growth going into 2013.", "With that, Operator, we'll give the call back to you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. With me this morning are David Steiner, Chief Executive Officer; Jim Fish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Trevathan, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating officer. David will start things off with a summary of the financial results of the quarter. Jim will cover our revenue growth, including price and volume trends, operating costs and the financial statements. We will conclude with questions and answers.", "During our statements, any comparisons, unless otherwise stated, will be with the third quarter of 2011.", "Before we get started, let me remind you that in addition to our earnings press release that was issued this morning, we have filed a Form 8-K that includes the earnings press release as Exhibit 99.1 and is available on our website at www.wm.com. The Form 8-K, the press release and the schedules for the press release include important information that you should refer to.", "During the call, you'll hear certain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, projections, estimates, opinions or beliefs about future periods. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in today's press release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Form 10-K.", "Additionally, during the call, David and Jim will discuss our earnings per diluted share, which they may refer to as EPS, or earnings per share, on an \"as adjusted\" basis. Our EPS and net income, as well as income from operations margins, operating expenses, SG&A expenses and expenses as a percent of revenue, have been adjusted to exclude items detailed in our earnings press release that management believe do not reflect our fundamental business performance or are not indicative of our results of operations. These measures, in addition to free cash flow, are non-GAAP measures.", "Please refer to the earnings press release footnote and schedules attached thereto, together with the Item 2.02 of the Form 8-K filed today, both of which can be found on the company's website at www.wm.com, for a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures.", "David and Jim will also discuss our results in the areas of internal revenue growth from yield and internal revenue growth from volume. Unless stated otherwise, please note that any references to yield or volume results are more specifically referring to internal revenue growth from yield or volume.", "This call is being recorded and will be available 24 hours a day beginning approximately 1 p.m. Eastern Time today until 5 p.m. Eastern Time on November 14th.", "To hear a replay of the call over the Internet, access the Waste Management website at www.wm.com.

Steiner", "Thanks, Ed. Good morning from Houston. In the third quarter of 2012, we earned $0.61 per share. We're particularly pleased by those results given that the headwinds from commodity prices exceeded our previous expectations. Our income from operations margin grew 30 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2011. And our income from operations margin, excluding depreciation and amortization, grew 90 basis points. Collection and disposal yield was 0.8% and grew sequentially for the first time in 6 quarters, despite the anniversary of our environmental fee in the quarter. And on a work day adjusted basis, our volumes in the core solid waste business were positive for the third consecutive quarter. So as has been the case through the year, our core solid waste business continues to perform well, and we're seeing some positive trends as we approach 2013.", "Adjusting for 1 less work day in the third quarter, volumes were positive 0.5%. We saw a positive volume growth in each of our industrial, MSW, C&D, special waste and recycling operations. Year-to-date, volumes through the third quarter are positive and as such, we still expect to achieve our full year volume guidance of flat to slightly positive volumes.", "Looking at our yield in the third quarter of 2012, each of our collection and landfill lines of business saw positive yield. Our MSW, C&D, special waste and roll-off segments achieved both positive yield and positive volume.", "On the collection side, we continue to focus on our core price increases. Core pricing consists of price increases, plus all fees, other than our fuel surcharge, less all price rollbacks. When we look at the core price component of solid waste yield, it increased 2.6% in the quarter, consistent with the last few quarters and indicating our continued commitment to pricing discipline. We improved our rollbacks in the third quarter when compared to the third quarter of 2011. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in rollbacks. More importantly, only once since 2005  has our rollback percentage been lower than it was this quarter, and we expect both core pricing and rollbacks to continue to improve in 2013.", "In order to see the effects that commodities will have on our full year results, we look at both our recycling and waste-to-energy operations. With respect to recycling, when we gave our initial guidance at the beginning of the year, we expected commodity prices to have a negative impact of about $0.04 per share for all of 2012.", "Through the first 9 months of 2012, we've incurred a negative year-over-year impact of $0.14 per share from recycling commodity prices. In the fourth quarter, we're expecting an additional $0.04 per share of headwinds from recycling commodity prices. So for the full year, recycling commodity prices will create about $0.18 of headwinds versus our expectation of about $0.04, a $0.14 difference.", "Turning to our waste-to-energy business, average electricity pricing declined a little more than 12% in the third quarter when compared to the third quarter of 2011. Our waste-to-energy operations caused a $0.02 drag on our earnings per share for the third quarter compared to the third quarter of 2011.", "In our original guidance for waste-to-energy, we predicted a negative impact of about $0.05 per share for the full year of 2012. Through the first 9 months, we've experienced a headwind of $0.07 year-over-year, or $0.02 more than we expected. In the fourth quarter, we expect our waste-to-energy operations to be flat to slightly down year-over-year.", "So looking at our combined recycling and waste-to-energy operation, the total negative effect is $0.16 of unexpected headwinds for the full year. If we added that $0.16 to our $2.08 to $2.13 guidance, we would be at $2.24 to $2.29, right in line with our guidance at the beginning of the year. So you can see that without these headwinds, we would have been soundly on course to achieve our original full year goals, which demonstrates the stability and continued strong performance of our core solid waste business.", "The reorganization that we announced at the end of the second quarter is progressing as we expected. During the third quarter, we had approximately $9 million in savings, and we expect to see about $20 million in savings for the fourth quarter. This puts us on track to achieve the full $130 million in annual savings anticipated for 2013.", "So through the first 9 months of 2012, our core solid waste business has grown and margins have continued to improve. With yield and cost savings accelerating into 2013, we should see continued margin expansion. If we see a recovery in commodity prices, that would accelerate earnings growth, but we will not count on any commodity price improvements to drive earnings in 2013. We will focus on improving those things that we can control -- costs and yield -- and we expect to drive both in 2013. Of course, we'll give further guidance and assumptions on our fourth quarter earnings conference call.", "In summary, we expect our core business to continue to perform solidly as it has since the beginning of the year. Commodity prices will again be a hurdle in the fourth quarter, and as of today, we expect to see an approximate headwind of $0.04 to $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter.", "Even with this, we expect full year earnings to be between $2.08 and $2.13 per share. If we take into account the $0.07 per share incremental headwind difference in the fourth quarter, we would still be on track to achieve the earnings range of between $2.15 and $2.20 per diluted share that was given after the second quarter.", "From a cash flow perspective, we're on track to generate operating free cash flow of about $850 million, despite nearly $200 million of commodity headwinds in 2012, an increase in capital expenditures of about $200 million and about $100 million of additional cash taxes in 2012. With our focus on yield and cost improvements in 2013, and with cash impacts from commodity prices expected to abate, we expect to see operating cash flow increase in 2013 while continuing to make investments toward a natural gas fleet.", "We're building a solid plan for 2013 that I'm confident our team can deliver. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our third quarter results in more detail.", "James C. Fish", "Thank you, David. I will start by describing the changes in revenue, including yield and volume, and then I will discuss costs and cash flow. Revenue for the third quarter declined by $61 million or 1.7% from the prior-year period due to lower recycling commodity prices. If commodity prices were at third quarter 2011 levels, third quarter 2012 revenue would have increased by $115 million or 3.3% from the prior-year period. The revenue decline from recycling commodity prices was partially offset by acquisitions, improved yield and fuel surcharges.", "Yield on our collection and disposal operations grew 0.8% in the third quarter. As David mentioned, this is the first quarter of sequential yield improvement out of the last 6 quarters.", "Adjusting for the change in pricing at our waste-to-energy plants in South Florida, our yield growth for the third quarter of 2012 was 1%. We were able to achieve this with virtually no incremental benefit from our environmental fee, which had a large impact last year.", "Compared to the third quarter of 2011, in the third quarter of 2012, we had improved pricing and fewer rollbacks in the collection lines of business. In the collection business, yield grew 1.3% in the third quarter. More specifically, commercial grew 1.5%, industrial grew 1.8% and residential grew 0.8%. All of these were improvements from the second quarter of 2012.", "In the landfill line of business, all of the waste streams achieved positive yield in the third quarter of 2012. In total, landfill yield was a positive 0.6%. Work day adjusted internal volume growth was 0.5%, consistent with what we've seen in the first half of 2012. More importantly, this is the first time we've seen 3 consecutive quarters of volume growth since 2005. This growth was driven by recycling volumes at our MRFs, which grew 5.1%, and landfill volumes, which grew 4.3%. We've seen strength in recycling volumes all year, and it's encouraging to see the MSW landfill volumes turn more substantially positive recently.", "Specifically in the landfill business, special waste volumes grew 4.9%, MSW grew 3.4% and C&D volumes improved 0.1%. Landfill volume growth was partially offset by collection volume declines of 1%. More specifically, commercial volumes declined 2.5% and residential declined 1.4%.", "In the industrial business, volumes grew 1.2%. As I mentioned, recycling volumes improved 5.1% organically in the quarter and 10.4% when you include acquisitions. Unfortunately, commodity prices were down in the quarter, but we remain committed to recycling to extract value from the materials that we collect.", "The decline in recycling commodity prices also impacted our operating costs as a percent of revenue. As a percent of revenue, operating costs increased to 64.2% of revenues compared with 63.9% in the third quarter of 2011. We did see savings in cost of goods sold due to lower recycling commodity rebates.", "Without these savings, our operating costs would have increased when compared to the third quarter of 2011. Third quarter subcontractor costs added 120 basis points, and repair and maintenance costs added an additional $17 million or 60 basis points of cost. Maintenance costs have been up all year due to our waste-to-energy operations and increases in cost of tires, parts and lubes. As we add newer trucks to our fleet and improve our maintenance processes, we should see maintenance costs improve.", "SG&A costs were $332 million in the third quarter, an improvement of $48 million. As a percent of revenue, SG&A costs improved 120 basis points on an adjusted basis. The main drivers of the improvement in SG&A costs were a reduction in incentive compensation accruals and savings from our reorganization. SG&A savings from our restructuring should increase from $7 million in the third quarter to approximately $17 million in the fourth quarter. Overall savings from the restructuring was $9 million in the third quarter and should increase to $20 million in the fourth quarter.", "The incentive compensation savings will not repeat in the fourth quarter, and in the fourth quarter, seasonal revenues decline -- seasonal revenue declines typically cause SG&A costs as a percent of revenue to increase. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we do not expect to be at the third quarter level of 9.6%. However, we do expect to see an improvement when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. We expect to end the year on track to achieve the $130 million in annualized savings from our restructuring in 2013, most of which comes out of SG&A.", "Our income from operations improved 30 basis points when compared to the third quarter of 2011. This is a good result, particularly given that we had to overcome recycling and waste energy headwinds, which reduced margins 140 basis points, and our Oakleaf operations, which further reduced margins 30 basis points. Our Oakleaf operations have greatly improved from the second quarter when we saw a negative 70-basis-point impact.", "At the end of the third quarter, our weighted average cost of debt was 5.1%, and our debt to total capital ratio was 60.2%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 6% at the end of the quarter. Our income tax rate as reported for the third quarter of 2012 was 36.1%. In the third quarter of 2011, it was 32.3%. The increase is related to nondeductible losses and a return to accrual adjustment. Our recurring rate is approximately 33.8%, which is what we expect to see in the fourth quarter.", "Turning to cash flow. Third quarter 2012 net cash provided by operating activities was $574 million. Cash from operations was impacted by 2 issues, which lowered it by about $150 million. First, the temporary increase in DSO reduced cash flow by approximately $100 million. Second, we had a settlement for the termination of forward-starting swaps related to our recent debt issuance, which decreased cash from operations by approximately $59 million. Without these 2 factors, we would have seen an increase of about $75 million of net cash from operations or an increase of more than 11%. Our capital expenditures for the third quarter were $402 million, resulting in free cash flow for the quarter of $180 million.", "The previously discussed impact of the cash from operations change and an increase in capital expenditures drove the free cash flow changes. The increase in capital spending was primarily for fleet capital, of which 90% was for CNG vehicles.", "We're on track to achieve the cash from operations and capital expenditure components of our free cash flow range, which would generate between $800 million and $850 million of cash for the full year, despite the combined $300 million in headwinds from commodity pricing and cash taxes and $200 million in additional capital.", "As discussed on the second quarter conference call, our full year free cash flow range assumed the sale of selected assets. We are in the process of evaluating opportunities to sell these assets. If we determine not to sell them at this time or we do not complete the sales before year end, it will reduce the proceeds from divestitures component of our free cash flow, but it will not affect cash flow from core operations.", "We returned $164 million to our shareholders through third quarter dividend, and we invested $24 million in acquisitions.", "In summary, we are pleased on balance with the results of our operations. And for that, I thank all of our employees. Their dedication and hard work allows us to generate solid earnings and return cash to shareholders despite the headwinds we have confronted. While we still have work ahead of us, we look forward to a more rewarding 2013. Coupled with the daily efforts of our employees, we anticipate our earnings and free cash flow to grow in 2013 and beyond.", "And with that, Nicole, we can open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "The first question is just on SG&A. Is it possible for you to break out how much of the decline was due to lower incentive comp accruals and how much was the restructuring? And then going forward, Dave, maybe you can comment on your conviction level in executing on beyond the $130 million which you talked about. And maybe talk about some of the risks in not getting there.", "David P. Steiner", "Yes. When you look at the number with respect to the bonus accrual, that was about $0.03 for the quarter. When you look going forward, Hamzah, the $130 million, we have, I can guarantee you, we have locked down to the penny. We know exactly where it came from, and we know exactly how to keep it from coming back, and we're monitoring that every day. We've also put a couple of folks in charge of trying to increase that $130 million. We fully expect that we'll see some dollars from that. We haven't built that into our plans yet, but we fully expect that we'll see more than that $130 million. But the $130 million is locked and loaded for 2013.", "Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Got it. And then on the asset sales, maybe if you can give a little more color as to your thought process there. Are these assets that you want to get rid of and this is just a timing issue? Or are you still debating whether or not to sell those assets? And then maybe talk about your -- talk about maybe buybacks. You didn't buy back any shares this year. Is that something that we can expect next year, for you to buy back stock? Or is this just a new GAAP allocation policy where you're more focused in on just the dividend?", "David P. Steiner", "Yes. When you look at the asset sales, if you can imagine, the asset sales, there's a number of them and they're all in various stages of completion. So we have a couple where we have letters of intent, and we're pushing to get them closed by the end of the year. We have a couple where we're looking at letters of intent. And then, frankly, we have quite a few of the oil and gas properties that we have, that with oil in the $80 range, we did not get offers that we found attractive enough. And as you all know, we don't have to sell those properties, and so we probably will not sell those properties. And so with having those asset sales at all points across the spectrum, from letter of intent to assets that we pulled off the table, we just wanted to make sure that folks realize that we may or may not get to that full run rate by the end of the year. With respect to the capital allocation policy, that hasn't changed. We'd like to add to that mix between dividends and share repurchases. We'd like to add to that mix, making sure that we have stability on our balance sheet from a coverage point of view. But as far as our philosophy goes, that hasn't changed.", "Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And just last question, on CapEx. Is it fair to say you're running above normal right now on CapEx?", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, that's -- so when we look at it, we're probably running, Jim, $200 million to $300 million above our running 5-year average. Obviously, we were $200 million higher than we were last year. So I would say yes, we are running a little bit above average. But the good news is, is that the reason we're doing that is to invest in that natural gas fleet, which, as we've discussed before, is not only good for us from a new fleet point of view, from a maintenance point of view, but clearly with the differential between natural gas and diesel, it creates some immediate economic benefit.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Scott Levine with JPMorgan.", "Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So it sounds like generally speaking, the pricing news was pretty positive across the business overall, and I was hoping you might be able to provide some color with regard to how much of that was really a function of internal initiatives on your part, as well as your comments and thoughts on the operating landscape in general and what helps you compensate for the anniversary of the environmental fees in the quarter.", "David P. Steiner", "Yes. From the pricing environment point of view, I'd say it's a fairly stable environment. When you look at our churn rate, you don't see the churn rate going up. When you look at the rollbacks, the rollbacks have been very positive. And that all points to a very stable pricing environment. When you look at what drove it in the quarter, as usual, it's core price increases. It went up obviously because rollbacks went down. And that's where the focus is on 2013. When you look at 2013, there's 3 big components that are going to drive our yield: first, the core price increase, the price increase that we put out on the street; second, the rollback percentage; and then third, making sure that we have compliance with all of our fees and surcharges. We've seen that slip a little bit in the last few years. And so we've gotten together with the group leadership and with every one of our 17 AVPs. And I can promise you they've got a laser focus on pricing going into 2013.", "Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And I think there was an expectation there might be some increase in the contribution from fuel surcharges in the quarter. It looks like that wasn't the case. Should we expect that going forward? Or maybe a little color there?", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, with fuel prices coming down, obviously, there wasn't as much raw dollars, but we actually were positive. And remember, at the beginning of the year, we were running a little bit behind on the fuel surcharge, where we were losing a couple of million dollars. This quarter, I think, we made $4 million on the fuel surcharge. So we said it early in the year that we'll start to see it even out as prices come down, and that's exactly what's happened.", "Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Got it. One last one, if I could. The release indicates you expect earnings and cash flow to grow next year. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color in terms of what gives you the confidence to make that statement. It looks like commodities have moved up here in the month of October. And then also, with respect to the outlook for cash flow, maybe a little bit more color with regard to the impact from the issues, like commodities, like CapEx, like cash tax that were incremental headwinds that you didn't foresee in '12 and what your expectations would be for those items for '13.", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, exactly. We'll give a lot of detail on that when we do our guidance after the fourth quarter. Obviously, we'll have a lot more visibility into the year as we go through our business plans right now. But when you look at next year, there's 2 things that I would say are going to drive the cash flow. Obviously, the first is our cost programs and pricing, and that should drive an incremental -- a minimum of $200 million straight to the bottom line. And so you'll see cash generation go up nicely. That's assuming that we get no benefit from commodities. Obviously, this year we had a drag from commodities. And then if we get any types of benefits from bonus depreciation or anything like that, it's gravy on top. I would not expect us to see a dramatic change in CapEx next year. We are committed to changing over our fleet to CNG, and so we won't pull down that CapEx dramatically next year. But obviously, if environmental conditions change such that the earnings power isn't there because of changes in the economy, we certainly have the ability to pull that down a good $200 million to $300 million without affecting our business operations at all. So we should see some pretty strong cash flow generation increases next year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley.", "Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just answer the earlier fuel surcharge question from the angle of what's the willingness on the part of customers to accept these surcharges most recently. Any change in their behavior versus past fuel cycles?", "David P. Steiner", "No. It's -- I think everybody understands the nature of our business from a transportation point of view and the fuel that we use. And so frankly, what we've seen is a slight uptick in our compliance with the fuel surcharge, and we've put some processes in place out in the field to make sure that we aren't waiving that fuel surcharge. When we talked about the pricing environment, I would say that we've got a very stable pricing environment. What we have seen from some competitors is that they've waived fuel and environmental. And frankly, some of our folks started to do the same in order just to keep up with the competition. What we've told them is we're not going to do that. We're not going to waive fuel and environmental. That's just putting too much risk into our business plan going forward. You can get away with waiving fuel and environmental on Day 1. You can't get away with it for 1 year, 2 years or 3 years or 7 years, the time that we'd like to keep these customers. And so you've got to see increases as you see costs go up from both environmental compliance and the fuel. So we've put processes in place to make sure that we aren't waiving fuel and environmental. And obviously, those will continue into 2013. So we see nothing but increased compliance from that point of view. And we haven't seen a push back from customers really at all.", "Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, got it. And could you just elaborate a bit on the labor dispute? What's the nature of the issue there? And is it mainly behind us now?", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, it is. I mean, look, as you know, anytime you have a labor dispute, there are a lot of different issues. This was primarily economic. I mean, it was a disagreement as to what we thought wage increases should be in this economic environment. It only lasted less than 1 week, so we are able to get that out of the way. And we put some reserves in for some liquidated damages for some of the communities up there to make sure that we take care of our customers. But other than that, it's certainly behind us, and we continue to have very good relationships with our unions throughout the country.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Michael Hoffman with Wunderlich Securities.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "A question on free cash flow, David, your comment about it growing. So is it fair, based on the way you've characterized some of the data, we should be north of $1 billion on a comparative basis of that $850 million for this year?", "David P. Steiner", "We'll obviously -- yes, we'll give a lot more guidance when we give our 2013 guidance. But, yes. I mean, if you take the $800 million to $850 million that we're talking about this year, and you add that incremental $200 million that I'm talking about from cost and yield, it absolutely should be over $1 billion.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then Jim, the DSO hit this quarter, when does that reverse? What quarter or...?", "James C. Fish", "So, Michael, there were 2 components there that -- and first was really a handful of our municipal customers, who effectively made third quarter payments in the fourth quarter because their payments came in on the first and second of October. So that will reverse itself in the fourth quarter. The second component was really a number of our large customers, national account customers and energy services customers, who basically did a better job of managing their DPO than we did of managing our DSO. So I expect that, that will be an area of focus for us. To answer your question, though, about the number, we expect it to come back down by about 2 days. It was up by about 3 days in the third quarter. We expect at least 2 days to come back down at the end of the fourth quarter.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "At the end of the fourth quarter. Okay. And then your comment about the reorg had $9 million -- I just want to make sure I understood this correctly -- $9 million in the G&A favorably this quarter, $20 million in the third, fourth quarters. And that doesn't include, David, your comment about the $0.03 for bonus -- or not bonus depreciation, bonus accruals.", "David P. Steiner", "That's right. It was actually  $9 million total, $7 million in SG&A for the quarter, and $20 million in the fourth quarter and $17 million that will come out of SG&A.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And the fourth quarter bonus accrual adjustment should be the same as the third quarter, so we should take that out, too?", "David P. Steiner", "No, no. We won't have any significant bonus accrual reversal in the fourth quarter.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then to be clear, the Board's view on dividends is that they are paying a dividend and it's their intention, if they can, to grow it. That's clearly their intention still?", "David P. Steiner", "That's absolutely correct.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. There's no -- all right. And then lastly, can you help us understand the capital you're investing in the alternative technologies as you sort of the drive the future growth of the company. When should we start to think about those being breakeven on a free cash basis, let alone turning positive?", "David P. Steiner", "On a free cash basis, they are currently breakeven. But when we look at it, we look at it from a sort of a portfolio point of view as to when will these investments pay off. In other words, they are already cash neutral. The question is, when do they -- when are we able to monetize those? You might have seen one of our investments had a public offering out this year. They ultimately pulled it. But we would expect to see quite a few of those investments start to go public in the next 2 years.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Corey Greendale with First Analysis.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division", "First, I just wanted to follow up on the question Michael was asking about free cash flow. The $200 million drag from commodity prices, that's 2012 versus 2011, correct?", "David P. Steiner", "Correct.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division", "So to get back that entire $200 million, you would need commodity prices to get back to 2011 levels, on average. Is that the right way to think about it?", "David P. Steiner", "That's right. And look, when we put out our plan, I don't expect us to assume any benefits from commodity prices. Look, we think they're at a trough. We certainly think there's more upside than downside at this point in time, but we're not going to build in a dramatic rebound into 2013. We'll build in -- we'll build in more flat type prices for 2013 and then hope we'd get some benefit.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division", "Okay, I understand. One -- couple questions about the disposal side of the business. So if you just look at the national data, construction activity has been recovering pretty nicely for almost 1 year now. And I think in the script, Jim said that C&D volume was up 0.1%. Do you think -- is there still a lag effect here, where you would expect to see that pickup, given what we've seen as somewhat of a recovery in construction? Or do you think this is, for whatever reason, you're not going to get as robust volume growth as construction activity has been?", "David P. Steiner", "You know, Corey, we hear a lot about the construction activity. And frankly, we're not seeing it dramatically in the volumes yet, but we're certainly starting to hear from our folks out in the field that they see it coming. When I look at the quarter, frankly, the most encouraging thing that I saw in the quarter was that we're starting to see the volumes bounce back in the South and the West. They were the most dramatically affected by the downturn. And you're starting to see them turn positive from negative in a lot of the lines of business. To me, now look, obviously that's because they went down pretty dramatically in the downturn. But seeing those volumes start to pick up in the South and the West, I think, is probably a good sign that we will see some construction pop in 2013.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division", "Okay. And David, I know -- I think I know how you feel about disposal pricing. But could you just talk a little bit about how much room you think there is for upside in the near term, maybe 2013, how much -- where you think that might be able to get to?", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, look, I mean, you all have heard me say it before that disposal pricing is absolutely pivotal to us to sustain all of our pricing programs. And so we need to be more aggressive in 2013. As I've said to many of you, it's hard to be aggressive when you're seeing income from operations going down at your landfills, and that's what we saw between 2009 and early 2012. We've now had 3 straight quarters where we've seen improvements at the landfill side of the business. You saw that our volumes were pretty strong this quarter. So I would expect that in 2013, that will allow us to be more aggressive at the landfill.", "James C. Fish", "I might add to that, Corey, just one thing. When you look at our landfill volumes, pretty strong landfill volumes for the quarter, landfill price at 0.6%, and we also had an anniversary of our environmental fee on the landfill side of the business. We've talked a lot about it on the collection side of the business. But we had an anniversary of our environmental fee on the landfill side of the business too, which we've overcome. But as David said, really as pricing at the landfill goes, so goes pricing on the collection side of the business.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Jim, I think you mentioned earlier that residential collection yields were up about 80 basis points this quarter, which is a pretty nice acceleration from last quarter. Can you maybe just talk to what some of the biggest drivers were behind that improvement?", "James C. Fish", "Sure, yes. The biggest drivers, of course, are going to be twofold. One is the absolute price increase. The other is the reduction in rollbacks. And then of course, CPI. When you think about residential, a big chunk of that is CPI-driven. Our expectation for CPI is about 1.5%. It's about right. So we think that residential is still going through a bit of a competitive battle here, but we also see some encouraging signs on the residential side that possibly some of these contracts we've lost in the past due to price, those folks are not having such a good experience there, and we may see them bounce back.", "Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And to that point on rollbacks, can you maybe just give us a sense of how much overall rollbacks went down in the quarter and maybe what you're targeting for improvement in 2013?", "David P. Steiner", "Yes. Rollbacks -- rollbacks were down about 30% in the quarter, which obviously is a nice improvement. Look, if we could keep rollbacks at their current level as I said, it's the lowest level we've seen since 2005, with the exception of 1 quarter. So we're going to look for improvement next year. I'm not sure that we'll be able to get that 30% improvement, but we're going to target a good 20% to 30% improvement for next year.", "Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And I haven't heard much of a mention or any mention at all about the potential hurricane impact. I know it's obviously very early, but I'm just curious if you have any either business disruption or potential cleanup work that's baked into your current guidance.", "David P. Steiner", "Yes. We'll let Jim Trevathan, our COO, talk about the storm effects.", "James E. Trevathan", "Yes, Joe. I guess the first thing I would mention is that we've done extensive work the last couple of days. We battered down many of our East Coast operations just in preparation of the storm. Another piece -- a good piece of news, our people, our team members are all accounted for and safe. We start there. We're starting to see those operations start back today and will over the next couple of days. Right now the assessment's under way as to how much damage has been sustained. Generally, Joe, we don't see -- we see a little bit of impact the first couple of days around volume negatively. And obviously, with facilities down, any rebound in those volumes will occur over the coming weeks and months. Too early to really tell, but we have huge effort under way, given our experience in the South and along the East Coast around hurricane support. We've got teams ready to go with equipment, with personnel, technicians ready to go support those areas in their cleanup efforts. I do think it's a little early for us to tell about any volume change, though, other than the first couple of days that will be negative.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "A question for you on thinking about the leverage to the construction recovery. How do you see that playing out over the next couple of years? If you look at what C&D volume is today relative to the entire pie of the business versus what it was when construction was a lot better, as you think about construction activity normalizing, how much incremental volume upside is there in the business for you and how do we think about the potential incremental margins on that volume?", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, the incremental margin on our industrial side of our temporary roll-off business is pretty high, probably in the 35% to 45% range. And when you look at the potential bounce-back, the good news is, I think what we've seen over the last 18 months is that the bounce-back depends on 2 things, right, supply and demand. And what we've seen in the last 18 months, I believe, is that we've basically seen the pickup take up all of the supply. So in other words, in the downturn, you obviously had a lot of the local competitors that were stacking cans in the yard because they had nowhere to put them. What you've seen in the last 18 months is that all of those local competitors have generally used up their cans. They've got their cans and their trucks out on the street. And as you all know, it's pretty difficult right now for a small business to get a big loan from a bank. And so it's hard for them. And given the state of the economy, a lot of them aren't making big investments in new trucks and cans. And so I think what you've seen in the last 18 months is that we've started to eat up that excess supply that was on the market as demands picked up. And so now as demand picks up, I think what you'll see is that the large national companies that have more available assets will start to get more than their fair share.  On the downturn, we certainly lost more than our fair share because we wouldn't drop our price to maintain our volume. Those local competitors would do that. And so you should see, if construction bounces back, to me, that would be the most positive thing that could happen to our business because there's the ability to both get volume and price because of the slack in supply that's out there. So obviously, that's something that we all hope for in 2013. But again, we're not going to build that into our plan.", "James C. Fish", "Alex, one quick addition to that. In some ways, we have replaced some of that lost construction business in some areas of the country with energy services business. So when you look at our volumes, you see that special waste is up pretty significantly while C&D is basically flat. And it's the same equipment for the most part that we're using, so we're just taking equipment that would have otherwise been dedicated to construction business, and redeploying it. And it shows up when you look at landfill volumes and special waste, it shows up when you look at collection volumes with industrial still being fairly strong.", "Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "That's helpful. And could you just remind us what the environmental fee was last year in the third quarter that you had to overcome this year in the third quarter?", "James C. Fish", "7.5% was the environmental fee 1 year ago, and we bumped it to 10%.", "David P. Steiner", "We bumped it to 10% 1 year ago.", "James C. Fish", "Yes, we bumped it to 10%.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Adam Thalhimer with BB&T Capital.", "Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "David, what percent of your total business today would you characterize as urban markets? And I'm just curious with GDP growth getting a little bit better in Q3 versus Q2. Are you seeing any improvement in the dynamics in urban areas?", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, the urban areas have always been more competitive than the rural areas. But as you mentioned, they also have a lot more room for growth. And when I talk about seeing the volumes in the South and the West bouncing back, obviously, that's where a large part of the population is in California and Florida. And so I think you're absolutely right. I think you will see -- I think in the downturn you saw probably a relative outperformance in the rural markets. In an upturn, I think you see an outperformance in the urban markets. As far as the split between urban and rural, I'll let Ed research that and get that number for us.", "Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Okay. And then one more percentage. Have you ever broken out the percentage of your business that is C&D today versus perhaps the housing peak back in 2005, 2006?", "David P. Steiner", "Yes, we've looked, and I will tell you we don't have those numbers at our fingertips. But we've looked at that to see what we think would happen at peak versus trough. We don't have those numbers at our fingertips.", "Operator", "And you have a follow-up question from the line of Michael Hoffman with Wunderlich Securities.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "A question I forgot to ask. The $130 million in reorg savings, what is your expectation about the timing of when that's fully in the model?", "David P. Steiner", "Of that, when you look at the ramp-up from $9 million in the third quarter to $20 million in the fourth quarter, you can see it starts to ramp up almost to where it's at that $10 million a month run rate in the fourth quarter. We will hit the ground -- in 2013, we will hit the ground on Day 1 at that $130 million run rate.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So we can count that as -- if we're modeling it, we can say 100% of that is a benefit in '13?", "David P. Steiner", "That is absolutely locked and loaded.", "David P. Steiner", "And thank you, all, for joining us this morning. I know that many of you on the phone are in the region that was affected by Hurricane Sandy. As Jim mentioned, we have a lot of facilities and a lot of employees up in that region also. I just wanted to let you all know that our thoughts and prayers are with you. And as Jim mentioned, we've got a lot of experience dealing with these types of events. And there's one thing I can guarantee you. When it comes to waste management, for those folks that are in the affected areas, you've got the absolute best in the business that are going to help you as you go about cleaning up after the storm. And with that, operator, we'll sign off for this quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you for participating in today's conference call.

Before we talk about the specifics of the quarter, we wanted to look back at the full year 2012, and give a short overview of 2013.", "When we look at our business performance, we can divide it into three areas; traditional solid waste operations, our recycling operations, and our waste-to-energy business.", "Our traditional solid waste business performed about as we expected in 2012 with margins improving, adjusted yield at 1% and volume slightly positive. We expect each of those metrics to further improve in 2013 and we expect to take significant cost out of the business as a result of our restructuring, our productivity initiatives, and our back-office consolidation.", "So I\u2019m very optimistic about our traditional business. We expect to see about 7% to 10% growth and earnings in our additional business driven by pricing, cost controls and volume improvements. The expected growth and earnings would have been much higher about 15%, but for the expected increase and accruals for bonuses and long-term incentives in 2013, which was much lower in 2012. So our traditional solid waste business is very well positioned to perform in 2013.", "On the recycling front, commodity prices had a dramatic impact on 2012 earnings. 2012 saw significant declines in commodity prices driving $0.17 decline in earnings. Despite these results, we continue to believe that our future depends on diversion technologies, because our customers are increasingly demanding that we provide those services.", "Consequently, we will continue to invest in diversion assets as evidenced by our recent acquisition of Greenstar, which will add about 1.5 million tons of sorted and brokered recycling commodities to our business. This acquisition is integral to our strategy of extracting more value from the waste stream, it aligns with our customer sustainability goals and it differentiates Waste Management from other competitors.", "For 2013, we expect that Greenstar will have a negligible effect on earnings, because we agreed to pay certain post closing expenses in return for a dollar-for-dollar reduction of the purchase price. After we complete the integration, which should occur by end of 2013 and assuming five-year average commodity prices, we would expect to receive from Greenstar about $30 million in annualized income from operations excluding depreciation and amortization.", "With Greestar added to business a $10 movement in commodity prices would have about $30 million to $40 million effect on earnings. So we are very well positioned to commodity price increase. As we have with our existing recycling business, we will also work to negotiate recycling contracts on new volumes that provide protection if commodity prices decline.", "For 2013, we built our plans using commodity prices that average about $100 per ton based upon the mix of commodities in our single-stream facilities. In that case, our overall recycling business will be down approximately $0.02 in 2013 compared to 2012. In January, the Blended rated our recycling facilities as approximately $93 per ton.", "Some of you may remember the space of our collection pricing programs that we called our business improvement plan or BIP. BIP basically identified our underwater collection customers and implemented large price increases to bring those customers up to an acceptable level of profitability. Most of the customers about 80% accepted the price increases which were in the 15% to 25% range and the good news was that those customers that left were unprofitable, so it didn\u2019t affect our profitability.", "Given where commodity prices have been over the last year and increasing complexity in contamination levels of materials we see, its time for us to do something similar with our recycling customers. As contracts come due, we will likely need to implement double digit price increases on some customers to return them to profitability.", "As for our waste-to-energy business, in 2012, our operations had a negative impact of $0.08 to our earnings per share. Natural gas and electricity prices remained low. In addition, some of our long term waste disposal and electricity contracts are expiring and we\u2019d expect them to be rebid at lower prices.", "The biggest impact to our waste-to-energy business will come from our South Florida plants, where long-term disposal contracts are being rebid at rates as much as $15 per ton, or 26% lower than current rates. After the South Florida reset, we\u2019ll only have about 10% of our long-term disposal and 5% of our long-term power contracts expiring in the next two years.", "Accordingly, overall we expect our waste-to-energy business to have a negative $0.2 impact on 2013 earnings. There should not be significant variability in the earnings related to commodity prices, as we have about 68% of the electricity pricing for the portfolio locked in for 2013.", "Returning to our solid waste operations, we continue to see positive signs through January. Yield for collection and disposal was the highest all year in the fourth quarter of 2012. And we continue to see improved MSW volumes, which should help landfill pricing.", "Before we expect both price and volume metric to improve in 2013, and our January results reflected that. Of course, one month does not make a trend, but we\u2019ve set the plans and incentives in place to drive yield above 1% and moving toward 1.5% in 2013. We expect the full-year 2013 volumes to be 0.5% to 1% positive, compared with 2012.", "Turning to free cash flow; in 2012, we generated about $829 million of free cash flow. We saw a significant drag on free cash flow from our recycling operations, cash taxes, and working capital. In 2013, we expect to grow free cash flow by 33% to 45%, to $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, without the benefit of any divestitures.", "However, we accomplish our $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion goal for free cash flow in 2013; but first, we forecast cash from operations to increase about a $100 million. We should also get about a $120 million benefit from working capital, primarily as a result of reduced bonuses for 2012 but would normally be paid in 2013.", "And finally, we will manage our capital expenditures in line with our free cash flow goal. We expect to spend about $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion in capital expenditures in 2013, which should allow us to continue to move to a natural gas fleet and invest in our business, while achieving our $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion free cash flow goal.", "Though we will not spend our full 2013 capital budget until we know we can reach our goal, we generally spend about $1 billion in capital expenditures to meet our landfill fleet container need. With the increase in our purchase of natural gas vehicles, we will certainly spend that level of capital in 2013.", "Additional capital is spent on growth projects such as landfill gas to energy projects, recycling plants, transfer stations and new contracts. We fully expect to spend capital on these types of project in 2013, but we will better monitor the pace of spending to remain on track to meet out free cash flow expectations.", "In other words, we will aggressively manage our capital spending to achieve both our ROIC and our cash flow goals. If the economy is not as strong as we expect, where commodity prices slide in 2013 like it did in 2012, we will manage our capital expenditures accordingly to meet our free cash flow goals.", "We expect to achieve our cash flow goal without any benefit from divestitures. Any divestiture would obviously create additional free cash flow. And we do expect to have some divestitures in 2013 and 2014, but we did not build our targets assuming that will happen. If they do happen, that would be great and would give us more of an opportunity to pay down debt, return more cash to our shareholders or invest in our business.", "As an example of the types of assets, divestitures that might add to free cash flow, in the past few years, we spent cash on growth projects another areas outside of our traditional solid waste business. We believe these investments have positioned us well to meet the changing needs of our customers.", "In the next two years, we expect to reduce the number of investments and harvest or monetize some of our investments through sale or public offerings. I expect the cash proceeds we realize from those investments should exceed any amounts that we invest. In addition, we\u2019ve also invested a number of hydrocarbon assets that we estimate have a value in excess of $200 million.", "As you know, we look to monetize those investments in 2012, but the markets were not receptive. We continue to look for opportunities to monetize these assets, but we will not sell at the best prices. So again, I would expect these assets to be net cash positive over the next few years.", "Turning now to our earnings guidance; you can see that we\u2019re forecasting modest EPS growth in 2013 between 3% and 6%, but very strong free cash flow growth of between 33% and 45%. I previously discussed how we\u2019ll grow cash flow in such a significant pace.", "Projected earnings growth has been impacted by about $120 million of compensation headwinds from accruals that we expect in 2013, assuming target payout of our annual long-term incentive plans, compared to a significantly low incentive compensation expense in 2012.", "We do not expect to have those headwinds in 2014. So we expect our 2014 earnings growth to get back to the 8% to 12% growth that is our goal in a more normalized economic and commodity environment. And of course, if commodity prices rebound, we\u2019re in a great position to benefit from such a rebound.", "So in summary, when we look at 2013 and beyond, we expect to get back the strong and steady free cash flow at about $1.2 billion per year and growing over time. We\u2019re confident that we can move towards that goal in 2013 while still growing our company and without any help and in fact assuming some headwinds from our recycling and our waste-to-energy businesses.", "When commodity prices rebound and when the price resets are done at our waste-to-energy operations, those areas should contribute to cash flow growth along with our continued focus on pricing and cost controls. Additionally, we believe that we can manage capital expenditures over the next few years to achieve our free cash flow targets while continuing to invest in our core business, including our natural gas fleet and diversion technology. And finally, as we monetize some of our past investments, we\u2019ll have further opportunities to produce free cash that we can use to pay down debt, return to our shareholders or invest in our business.", "So that lays out our 2013 plan. We\u2019re going to return to those things that drove profitability from 2005 to 2007 pricing and cost controls while continuing to invest in our future. We\u2019re confident that we can achieve our goals in a low growth economy with current commodity prices. Overtime we expect the commodity prices and recovering economy should return us to growing free cash flow and the 8% to 12% annual earnings growth.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our fourth quarter results and our 2013 outlook in more detail.", "James C. Fish, Jr.", "Thank you, David. I\u2019m going to review the results of the fourth quarter and expectations for 2013. I\u2019ll start with a review of the fourth quarter yield and volume; I will then go into the key drivers of expense and cash flow.", "Revenue for the fourth quarter increased by $28 million or 0.8% from the prior year period; our revenue equivalent was driven by year-over-year increases in both yield and acquisitions, and we also continue to see improving volume trends in many areas of the business. The growth was muted by a decline in recycle commodity prices.", "Yield on our collection and disposal operations was up 0.9% in the fourth quarter and 0.8% in the full year. Adjusted for the change in pricing at our waste-to-energy plant in South Florida, our yield growth for the fourth quarter of 2012 was 1.1% and was 1% for the full year. This is the second consecutive quarter of sequential yield growth and demonstrates our commitment to yield management.", "Pricing efforts that we implemented during 2012 accelerated in the second half of the year, and we\u2019ve continued to see positive results in January. The combined internal revenue growth from yield and our collection business was 1.3% in the fourth quarter, with 0.9% growth in commercial, 2.2% growth in industrial, and 1.5% growth in residential. Our industrial and residential had the highest yield of the year in the fourth quarter.", "In the landfill line of business, we achieved yield of 1%, up from the 0.6% that we saw in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter both MSW and C&D had the highest rate per unit we\u2019ve seen all year. We are extremely committed to yield improvement in 2013.", "As David mentioned, we expect yield in the range of 1% to 1.5%. On the volume side of the business, internal revenue growth from volume improved by 0.4% in the quarter. This is the first year since 2005 that all four quarters had positive volume on a workday adjusted basis. The growth was primarily driven by an increase in recycling volumes at our Maersk, landfill tons, and the industrial line of business.", "Specifically, in the landfill business, C&D volumes grew by 20.7%, almost all from Hurricane Sandy. MSW grew by 3.2% and special waste volumes improved 0.4%. In the second half of the year, we\u2019ve seen a nice improvement in MSW volumes, the largest drivers increased volume from Oakleaf and vendor haulers. Recycling and landfill volume growth was partially offset by collection volume declines of 1.6%. More specifically, commercial volumes declined 2.7% and residential declined 2.2%, and the industrial business volumes grew by 1.3%.", "In 2013, we anticipate that volumes should improve slightly from 2012, and range from 0.5% to 1% for the full year. I will now discuss operating costs. Operating costs increased by $71 million in the fourth quarter to 64.3% of revenue compared to 62.9% in the fourth quarter of 2011.", "The primary drivers of the increase were cost associated with operating recently acquired businesses, maintenance and labor. When compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, maintenance cost increased 6.6% and labor cost increased 2.3%.", "SG&A costs were $355 million in the fourth quarter, an improvement of $26 million. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A cost improved 90 basis points to 10.3%, the main drivers, the improvement in SG&A costs, or a reduction in incentive compensation accruals and savings from our reorganization. We fully expect 2013 adjusted SG&A costs to remain flat to improve 10 basis points as a percentage of revenue.", "We expect significant costs reductions from our reorganization in 2013. We also have plans in place to reduce SG&A costs further. 2013, we are looking at non-labor SG&A costs and in 2014, back office consolidation to continue the down drive SG&A costs to a goal of 10%.", "At year end, our weighted average cost of debt was 5.2%; our debt-to-total capital ratio for the quarter was 59.8%, consistent with our target ratio of about 60%. Floating rate portion of our debt portfolio was 10% at the end of the quarter. Our income tax rate as reported in the fourth quarter of 2012 was 32.4% and 34% for the full year, for 2013, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 35%.", "Turning to cash flow, fourth quarter 2012 income from operations, excluding depreciation and amortization was $873 million, and net cash provided by operating activities was $577 million. Our capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $378 million and our free cash flow for the quarter was $215 million.", "For the full year 2012, free cash flow was $829 million, after capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion. Our free cash flow would have been up had we not had approximately $200 million in headwinds from commodity and cash taxes and $200 million in increased capital spending primarily related to C&D vehicles.", "We returned $165 million to our shareholders through our fourth quarter dividend and we invested $72 million in acquisitions. For the full year 2012, we returned $658 million to our shareholders in dividends and we invested $250 million on acquisitions. Our Board has indicated it will increase dividends in 2013 by 2.8% to $1.46 per share on an annual basis, which would result in dividend yield of approximately 4%. This is the tenth consecutive year of increasing the dividend. For 2013, the anticipated annual dividends equate to $680 million to be returned to our shareholders. We also have an authorization to repurchase up to $500 million of our shares.", "During 2013, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion and free cash flow in 2013 is expected to grow between 33% and 45% to between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion. In 2013, we are focused on improving yield, reducing costs and efficiently allocating capital. For yield, the fourth quarter results are accelerating in January. They are stepping in the right direction and we have a long way to go to achieve our goals.", "On the cost reduction fronts, we are on track to achieve our full annual savings from the restructuring, but we are not stopping there. We have plans in place to continue to reduce our cost structure in both operating and SG&A costs and continued rollout of our routing and logistic solution will help us achieve the cost reduction targets.", "To reinforce this, our annual incentive compensation plans and corporate cost saving scopes for employees and field operations, 50% of their plan is based on improving operating costs as a percent of revenue. For corporate employees, 50% of their annual bonus is based on achieving SG&A targets. As we look at capital and the declines in landfill tons, we\u2019ve seen over the last several years, we need to spend capital on assets that are performing the best and fit within our long-term strategy to extract value from the materials that we manage.", "If a project, a landfill or a collection asset is not meeting minimum returns, we will make the tough decision to rationalize the use of that asset and reduce capital, or shift it to a more economical use. Also, with respect to allocation of our cash, in the past few years, we\u2019ve made investments in new technologies and payouts over a longer period of time.", "In the next few years, we\u2019ll focus more on building out our existing suite of conversion technologies, such as our Philadelphia spec fuel plant and investing in areas that offer quicker returns like traditional solid waste dumping acquisitions.", "So when you put it all together, we expect that 2013 will be a year of modest earnings growth, but with free cash flow growing between 33% and 45%, and we estimate our 2013 fully diluted earnings per share to be between $2.15 and $2.20 per share.", "I want to close by thanking our employees who worked tirelessly throughout a tough 2012 to position our company for an improved 2013 and beyond.", "With that, Carmen, let\u2019s open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Credit Suisse.", "Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Good morning. Thank you.", "David P. Steiner", "Good morning.", "Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Hey, David, my first question is, if you could talk about your interest for the work that you\u2019ve done may be to explore a more tax efficient structure, whether it be on the MLP or REIT side, I realize that there are precedence on the landfill MLP side, but the REIT side may be tougher given the various businesses you are in, but the landscape that has changed in the last 12 months.", "So maybe if you could talk about any work you\u2019ve done there, which external advisors you\u2019ve hired, when you did the work, and just maybe talk about your long-term interest in moving to a more tax efficient structure, particularly as you become a more focused company in terms of divesting non-core assets.", "David P. Steiner", "Yeah, Hamzah, I think obviously we are always interested in methods to create shareholder value. Since the first day I came here, I\u2019ve been interested in the REIT structure, but as you know the rules and regulations weren\u2019t particularly conducive to it. Certainly in the last couple of years, we\u2019ve seen the developments that are more positive with respect to looking at a REIT structure, but there is still a lot of uncertainty out there. And so we\u2019ll continue to monitor those developments and we\u2019ll see how it plays out.", "I would not expect that we would go out and try to set a President by getting a private letter rule or anything sort like that. We\u2019d like to see a little bit more positive development before we incur that kind of expense. But in the meantime, there is always a lot of both operational and as you know technical issues that you have to resolve and we are constantly looking at those through our tax department, through our outside advisors.", "Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse", "That\u2019s a very helpful. And then maybe if you could talk about how investors should think about the restructuring the plan that you guys have in place. It seems like nothing flows to the bottom line this year, because you have higher bonus accruals. If you look long-term, should investors expect this restructuring plan to be real? Are we going to see Waste Management\u2019s margins 300, 400 bps higher by the end of 2015? Or shall we continue to expect offsets on the costs side longer-term? Any color you can give there.", "James C. Fish, Jr.", "Yeah, look, so in 2013, the good news in 2013 is that the offset of the restructuring is purely an accounting accrual, it\u2019s not cash, right. So we will drop that $110 million from the reorganization. We will drop the cash to the bottom line in 2013. There is absolutely no doubt about that. But when you look ahead to 2014, to get that 300 basis points of margin improvement, we have to do a few things.", "First, in 2013, we are looking at additional non-labor SG&A savings, and we will get those during the course of the year. And then in 2014, we start our back office consolidations and that should get us another 100 basis points of cost improvement. The other areas where we are going to get the cost improvement or get the 300 basis points of margin expansion is about 100 basis points of operating costs, which are riding logistics efforts.", "And then we\u2019ve got to get our yield backup \u2013 pushing backup towards 2%, while continuing to grow volumes, right. So the other place you get that margin expansion is through raising yield and growing revenue. So I\u2019m confident we can get that over the next two to three years. This year, we just happen to have that bonus accrual that will offset it from earnings point of view, but won\u2019t offset it from a cash point of view.", "David P. Steiner", "So I will just add to that Hamzah, that we are taking a very strong stance on not only non-labor SG&A, but further labor-related SG&A costs going into 2013.", "Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. And then just last question from me, have you guys thought about bringing the pricing back that you had, a number of years ago and you took that out. Is that something that you want to bring in an up market or down market? Maybe help us understand that dynamic.", "David P. Steiner", "Absolutely, and as you know, Hamzah, my commitment that pricing is doesn\u2019t matter, but it\u2019s up or down market. We\u2019re going to put the plans in place to drive yield. But you\u2019re absolutely right. I do think that we may have lost a little bit of our focus on yield and we took the yield gate off, that certainly when you put incentive plans in place, it drives behavior.", "So what we\u2019re doing in 2013 is we aren\u2019t putting a price gate in place. What we\u2019re putting in place is an incentive plan, right. And so what we\u2019ve got is a plan that allows our field leaders to earn about 50% of their annual compensation dependent upon them achieving yield of 1.5% for each of the next two years. And so that\u2019s a significant amount of compensation and risk for them. And I fully expect that we\u2019ll see the appropriate behavior for them to realize those benefits.", "Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot.", "David P. Steiner", "Certainly.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Bill Fisher with Raymond James.", "William H. Fisher \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Thank you. Good morning.", "David P. Steiner", "Good morning, Bill.", "William H. Fisher \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey, just some questions maybe on volume side, one on just the special waste outlook, can you just give us some color on what you are looking at for drilling or other waste streams in 2013 if you can grow that?", "David P. Steiner", "So for drilling, Bill, I would say that we are pleased with the progress we\u2019re making in that sector. It tends to move around, you see some of the shale plays move rigs between Marcellus to Utica over to Bakken. But we\u2019ve made progress on that front and then I would say that special waste right now looks pretty decent for us going forward.", "William H. Fisher \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And then on the collection side, you are getting some growth on the industrial and even on the landfill side, which is great. On the commercial collection, you seem to stuck in the negative buying range there. What would really takes that to turn, is it just more the simply the economy or pricing strategies or what\u2019s on that end?", "David P. Steiner", "Yeah, as you know, Bill, that\u2019s been stubbornly low over the last few years. We think that it\u2019s more economic related than it is pricing related. But certainly in 2013, we are going to be more aggressive than we\u2019ve ever been from the pricing point of view. But we\u2019ve also seen our rollbacks come down to the lowest level they are in the year and we thought a modest increase in the churn rate of 20 basis point increase in the churn rate. So, that\u2019s what leads us to believe that it\u2019s not our pricing program that\u2019s driving it, it\u2019s more economic related.", "William H. Fisher \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with BB&T.", "Adam R. Thalhimer \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Good morning. I wanted to ask David, what\u2019s the long-term strategic vision for the waste-to-energy business?", "David P. Steiner", "Yeah, the waste-to-energy business for us obviously has introduced some volatility into the earnings because of natural gas prices and the reset. What happened here was a lot of these plants were built 20 years ago and when they were built with financing; the 20-year bond had contracts that went with them both on the disposal side and on the electricity side.", "And so as those contracts roll off, they become merchant both from a disposal capacity and in electricity point of view. They couldn\u2019t have come off, obviously they couldn\u2019t have rolled off in a worst time from a disposal point of view and that\u2019s what we are seeing in South Florida.", "If they had rolled off in 2007, we would have been in a heck of a lot better shape, but we can\u2019t control the timing. But when you look at it long-term, it\u2019s been a great business for us. They are very valuable disposal assets, and you\u2019ve got some significant growth opportunities over in Europe.", "Right now, I would say, we are absolutely the leading company in the UK, which is a high growth market; we are the leading company in design and developing new projects there. So we think that once we get through these reset like I said in the next two years, only 10% from a disposal point of view and 5% from an electricity point of view, we will roll off in the next two years. So we should start to see some stability in the core business and we should start seeing that profitability uptick.", "Adam R. Thalhimer \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay, great. And then can you just comment may be a little bit on the construction and demolition business and what your outlook is there for 2013?", "David P. Steiner", "Yeah, I think the good news is we\u2019ve seen some good stability and actually some decent growth in our roll off business. Now, a lot of that obviously comes from the oil shale plays. But from a construction point of view, we\u2019ve seen good volume growth. We expect that to continue into 2013, but we don\u2019t expect it to bounce dramatically back to where it was sort of in the 2005 and 2007 range. So we are expecting modest growth in 2013 and if something better happens, we will be pretty surprise.", "Adam R. Thalhimer \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "David P. Steiner", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities Inc.", "Good morning.", "David P. Steiner", "Good morning.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities Inc.", "I want to try and drill down upon intended on this yield for 2013 1% and 1.5% and specifically the lack of pull through maybe that\u2019s coming through with the margin line and specifically EBITDA margins. So we heard earlier last week about pricing wasn\u2019t necessarily improving dramatically, but I hear from your color and cadence and by the tone that you expect pricing to increase. So specifically if I could where \u2013 what markets not necessarily geography, but what functional service area do you think price improvement is expected to be the greatest?", "David P. Steiner", "Look we started in September of last year putting together very specific market area by market area plan. I will tell you that there is no particular area of focus right, in other words, we\u2019re looking at pricing across the board. Now, when you look at it just from a pure dollar point of view, the biggest dollars obviously come out of our commercial line of business. And look with our cost going up, we need to get the kind of price increases that will cover our costs and help us to expand those margins.", "So just from a pure dollar point of view, you expect to see it mostly in the commercial line of business. But, it\u2019s why we talked a little bit about recycling commodity prices, my personal opinion is that over the last couple of years, we have certainly focused on commercial and roll off pricing. We haven\u2019t been as focused on landfill and recycling prices.", "In a market like we had in 2012, where we lost $120 million year-over-year from commodity prices, we need to be more aggressive in our pricing structure in order to return to profitability. On the landfill side, now that we\u2019ve seen some pretty good MSW growth over the last 12 months now, it\u2019s the time for us to get a little bit more aggressive on the landfill side. And as we all know, the landfill side is going to help support the collection side.", "So, if I look at 2013, I wouldn\u2019t say now that there is a \u2013 there is one geographic area that we are focused on, or one particular line of business that we are focused on, but I would tell you that we are going to put more focus than we have in the past on our landfills and recycling.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities Inc.", "David, what I\u2019m specifically struggling with and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m alone in this, but even with some of this price increase and the cost focus that you\u2019ve been sharing with us, we don\u2019t see a point through down to the EBITDA line. And I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s really more just headwinds in the end markets for price, or if it\u2019s competitors choking volume away, or what\u2019s the real root of the cause and I was, may be just hoping to see if you could shed some light on that?", "David P. Steiner", "You know, look when we did the, for example, when we did the Oakleaf deal, obviously, that was pretty margin dilutive, because it\u2019s a brokerage business model, and it\u2019s meant to be margin dilutive, because you\u2019re earning low margins, but with no capital involved, right. And so, I don\u2019t think it would be unusual to see those EBITDA margins go down.", "Now, we\u2019ve anniversaried the Oakleaf acquisition, now is when you actually should start seeing those EBITDA margins turn the other way in 2012. And quite honestly, we talk about our price in yield gates and our compensation plan in 2012 margin is 25% of the annual bonus for all of our leaders in the company and in order to earn that bonus margins have to go up next year.", "So we sort of expected to take, have diluted margins both from Oakleaf and from recycling commodity prices when you can understate the $120 million, $130 million that came down in commodity prices in 2012. We don\u2019t expect those same types of headwinds in 2013, so that\u2019s when you can see the margins turn back and we\u2019ve got the compensation plan that required us for that to happen for us to get paid.", "James C. Fish, Jr.", "So, I have one quick comment Al, but this is not so much that pricing is not fallen to the bottom line, but we\u2019ve got some things that we are focused on, I mentioned operating expense was up $71 million for the quarter that we mentioned back in the third quarter, we\u2019ve got to reign in maintenance costs, so maintenance costs was \u2013 in the fourth quarter was again up year-over-year pretty significantly.", "So we feel like it\u2019s not that the yield isn\u2019t falling to the bottom line, but we\u2019ve got some cost pressures that we are very much focused on and that\u2019s why I wanted to mention the fact that we\u2019ve got maintenance cost that there is somewhat out of line and our estimation, we\u2019ve bought lot of trucks in 2012, that just start to have an impact, but it\u2019s also a process issue there, so we got to manage that seem to get it and some others that have not learned their secrets yet. So we will look to pass that on to the rest of the company.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities Inc.", "Okay, I guess you are still long way either from 2% yield which I think is a little bit longer maybe it\u2019s a near-term target, maybe it\u2019s 14%/15%. But I just don\u2019t hear from you and others that the end market is necessarily accepting a facilitating price at the upper end of that 1.5, I hope I\u2019m wrong, but\u2026", "David P. Steiner", "No, I think actually the markets \u2013 I think at this point in time, the market is going to favor [of it]. We did come out of the deepest recession that we\u2019ve been in, a lot industries I think bounced back from that recession pretty quickly. As you all know, volumes in our industry have not bounced back as quickly as they have in some other industries.", "So I think people were a little bit, I can\u2019t speak for anyone else, I\u2019ll speak just for the Waste Management folks, the Waste Management folks were a little bit tepid in trying to put their toe into that pricing water. That\u2019s what I talked about earlier. When you had people that were a little bit tepid on putting their toe in the water and we didn\u2019t have the incentive in place to drive that behavior, I do think that we lost a little bit of our focus on pricing.", "It won\u2019t happen again. 2013, we\u2019ve got to drive that and look how we got to take sort of one step at a time. So we\u2019re going to get that thing up above 1.5% and then we\u2019ll start talking about margin up about 2%. But I think you\u2019re absolutely right, we\u2019d expect that to happen over the next couple of years.", "What we\u2019ve got going on pretty dramatically in the last couple of years are the anniversaries of our fees, particularly our environmental fee. That\u2019s reached 10% at this point in time. The question is how do we get those core price increases to make up for the anniversary of these and surcharges. We\u2019ve got the plans in place to get that done and as we start to see those anniversaries roll off, now you\u2019re starting to see all core price dropping to the bottom line and that\u2019s part of what will help us drive at above 1.5%.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities Inc.", "If I may just a clarification on the non-core asset sales, what are we calling non-core now, if hydrocarbon business, it sounds like that\u2019s going to be kept in the shared if you will and you\u2019re going to make some investments there, but what\u2019s non-core, what should we be viewing as non-core?", "David P. Steiner", "Yeah, when I\u2019m talking about non-core, I\u2019m talking about anything that is not solid waste or recycling related.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities Inc.", "Okay, but that...", "David P. Steiner", "So there is two categories, there is the hydrocarbon properties which we talk about. And then there is the investments that we\u2019ve made in a number of companies that use alternate processing technologies. And some of those companies, as we\u2019ve said all along, we design what I would call one of the better green portfolios in the United States, some of those companies are going to win, some of them are going to lose, I mean that\u2019s what the nature of the beast is.", "But we\u2019ve made those investments two and three years ago, a couple of those in the next two years I would expect to come to fruition. You don\u2019t invest in companies that go public the next day, you invest in companies and they go public over a longer period of time. And so I would expect over the next few years we\u2019ll see a couple of those investments go public, which give us the opportunity to monetize it if we decide to. We have a couple with that aren\u2019t as strategic to us which we thought maybe three years ago and we may look to settle some of those investments. And then we are not going to make a level of investments that we\u2019ve made over the last few years.", "Look, we\u2019ve got our \u2013 what I call our green portfolio in pretty good shape. We\u2019ve been investing over the last few years at a fairly high rate, we\u2019re not going to invest at that high rates going forward. And so, what we are trying to say is, those should be net cash positive. We\u2019ll still make some small investments but we\u2019re not going to make the size of investment that we made over the last three years and we\u2019re going to start to monetize some of those.", "So over the next two to three years, you should see that portfolio turn from being a net cash drag to be net cash positive, and its the exact same thing with the hydrocarbon properties. We\u2019ve been investing over the last three years. You should see us monetizing over the next three.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities Inc.", "Thank you, David, for your time.", "David P. Steiner", "Sure, no problem.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Michael Hoffman with Wunderlich Securities.", "Michael E. Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "Good morning and thank you for taking my questions.", "David P. Steiner", "Hi, Michael.", "Michael E. Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "Hey, David, how are you doing?", "David P. Steiner", "Great.", "Michael E. Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "Jim, David, could you walk through on the free cash side I think I followed this correctly. If I start with $829 million, it seems like it\u2019s add into the bottom of $1.1 billion. $110 million from restructuring, somewhere between $115 million to $200 million from less capital spending, other cost savings of $130 million to $230 million that achieved in non-labor, G&A and the cost it sold. And then I\u2019ve got headwinds of bonus accruals which I didn\u2019t do in 2012 and I\u2019m going to do in 2013, so I got a\u2026.?", "James C. Fish, Jr.", "That\u2019s just an accrual Michael; it\u2019s not cash. It\u2019s just an accrual. So that\u2019s the difference.", "Michael E. Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "So you don\u2019t expect to pay any cash out in 2013?", "James C. Fish, Jr.", "We pay it in 2014. So if we are at bonus in 2013 we don\u2019t pay at 2014.", "Michael E. Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "Okay. So the reflection here in this other cost savings, the G&A and the cost of goods savings, because I\u2019ve got a $30 million headwind from heating and electricity if that match correctly in $0.04?", "David P. Steiner", "Right, right.", "Michael E. Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "So that sort of a progress of that, I\u2019ve got that sort of match approximately\u2026", "James C. Fish, Jr.", "Yeah, you got \u2013 you sort of start with $825 million. We had $100 million from operations. If you add a $120 million from working capital and that gets you up to sort of $1 billion plus and then the filler if you will is the CapEx. Like as you said somewhere between $50 million to $100 million gets you to the bottom end of that range.", "Michael E. Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "Okay, all right. And then how do you think about the incentive comp plan as it relates to the returns on capital as well. And you had nearly 5 years of a negative slope to your return line, I assuming that\u2019s an another area that most interesting thing you will change that trend. So how do I think about \u2013 you just talk to us about in your returns on capital in 2013?", "James C. Fish, Jr.", "So I would \u2013 let me take a shot it down Michael. One of the things that I talked about my script was the fact that, we\u2019re going to go through a process of rationalizing assets. And when you look at some of these assets that are underperforming that have caused that degradation in return on capital. Those are the ones that specifically we will be looking at. I think it\u2019s kind of simple microeconomics that we\u2019ve got in terms of disposal probably too much capacity chasing to few tons, as we mentioned, we\u2019ve seen a big drop off over the last few years. So I think, and maybe that I was planning I think that ultimately helps the prices climate down the road.", "Michael E. Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "All right. Well, you\u2019ve given me a perfect segway to one of my question. How do you think about the prospects of being able to [mass dwell] your space? And all the complexities around closure and post-closure and looking at accounts what can you do, is that in the task will you do that and therefore get capacity on the market?", "David P. Steiner", "I think probably one thing more complicated than REIT, and that is landfill permits. We\u2019re in the early stages there, we will give you some more information going forward, but certainly it\u2019s not easy.", "Michael E. Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "Okay. But it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s something that\u2019s being explored, that\u2019s what I\u2019m hearing?", "David P. Steiner", "True.", "Michael E. Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "Okay. And then thanks for giving the opening on the REIT too. As I write my note tomorrow if I understood your statement, Waste Management is not pursuing a private letter ruling because it does not see as a viable opportunity at this time, but it remains open to alternative corporate structures if the rules would change in the future.", "David P. Steiner", "Yeah, I think that\u2019s fair. I probably characterize it Michael. I think there is more of a chance if it\u2019s happening today than there was two years ago, but there is still a lot of uncertainty out there. And at this point in time, I would say, I don\u2019t see us sort of taking the lead to try to do something that has that much of uncertainty around it. Why do I say that? You got a lot of operating issues, you\u2019ve got a lot of technical issues, and in order to get pass both of those you\u2019ve got to spend that heck of a lot of money. And so I would like to see, I would like to see a little bit more clarity in that arena, before we pull the trigger and spend a bunch of money chasing down that radical.", "Michael E. Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "Okay.", "James C. Fish, Jr.", "I guess, Michael, with that said, I mean we\u2019ve done enough work on it on the concept to know that REITs are evolving to include some less conventional businesses and as they continue to evolve, we\u2019ll keep our finger on that first.", "Michael E. Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "Okay. Thanks.", "David P. Steiner", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Corey Greendale with First Analysis.", "David Warner \u2013 First Analysis Corporation", "Good morning. This is David Warner for Corey. I had a quick question. You mentioned some positive trends in January. I was wondering if you could give a little more color on that whether those are volume trends, or you were getting some better pricing, what actually occurred in January that makes us optimistic for 2013?", "David P. Steiner", "Like I said one month doesn\u2019t make a trend, but we exited 2012 with some momentum in pricing and that\u2019s what I talked about before, because we started in September with our folks putting together detailed plan and we went out in the fourth quarter and said let\u2019s not be shy about implementing this plan, let\u2019s not wait till January 1, implement this plan, let\u2019s start implementing them right now, so that we can make sure we get the full benefit in 2013.", "And so from a pricing point of view, I think we developed a little bit of momentum in November and December of last year and we saw that momentum carryover into January 2013. Again, we just got our books closed, so we haven\u2019t got great detail around it, but we certainly saw the momentum from our pricing continue into 2013.", "I would say the same thing with respect to volumes, we sort of a came out of the back half of the year, feeling pretty good about volumes. It\u2019s interesting that we can talk about 0.4% growth, is feeling pretty good about volumes that shows you what I talked about earlier that this industry\u2019s volumes haven\u2019t recovered like some. But on the volume side, we saw some good numbers in January too.", "So again, I\u2019m not going to \u2013 we always say that you got to get four or five months into the year before you can really start to understand what\u2019s going on because of the seasonality, because of the weather, because of the business, Michael. And so, I\u2019m not ready to declare victory, but given that we did see those January results, we just thought it would be useful to give you all some color to let you know that the momentum that we saw coming out of the fourth quarter continued into January.", "David Warner \u2013 First Analysis Corporation", "Okay, thanks a lot. That\u2019s helpful. Just one follow-up on the landfill C&D volumes were up, I was wondering if you could maybe sort of just disaggregate Sandy out of that and then talk about whether you are seeing some evidence of nation housing recovery showing up in the C&D volumes?", "James C. Fish, Jr.", "So actually the large majority of that increase in C&D volumes was due to Sandy. C&D doesn\u2019t make up a huge percentage of our overall, but certainly the percentage increase was impressive and that was primarily due to Sandy. We are seeing anecdotally and talking to some of the ADPs seeing the housing market start to show some signs of strength. And I mention that on the special waste side, we\u2019ve got a fairly strong pipeline going forward, so I think I\u2019d say we\u2019re cautious about optimism.", "David P. Steiner", "Yeah, I don\u2019t about you all, but for about two years from 2010, 2012, when I go overseas particularly the China, it was the only place you\u2019d go where you see cranes on the skyline. Over the last year traveling throughout the United States, I\u2019m starting to see cranes on the skyline again, which I think is a positive sign.", "Again, we\u2019re not going to call that good times are here again. But I think it\u2019s safe to say that we believe what we\u2019re seeing is some stability and that we will actually continue to see some modest growth.", "David Warner \u2013 First Analysis Corporation", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "David P. Steiner", "Good morning.", "James C. Fish, Jr.", "Good morning, Joe.", "Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "The question in the change of incentive comp, I think one, you\u2019d mentioned that about 50% is now based on either a cost or margin target. I\u2019m just curious what that was before? And two, I guess what gives you the comfort that putting that high of a target on costs, it doesn\u2019t disincentive employees from pursuing growth or working capital or any other critical metrics?", "David P. Steiner", "Yeah, look, incentive plan design is part of science, part hot. And I\u2019ve been doing this for a long time and take a lot of time and effort to do it. And what you\u2019ve got to do is you\u2019ve got to properly balance the metric, right, you hit the nail right on the head. You can\u2019t put one metric in that drives behavior, because every metric you put in will drive some good behavior and some bad behavior, right.", "And so you\u2019ve got to put in metrics that that sometimes counterbalance each other. So when we do our plans, we generally look at margin, because margin in my mind is what means if you\u2019re going to get profitable growth. Look we don\u2019t want growth for growth sake. We want growth at accretive margins. And so that\u2019s why we put the margin piece in.", "Looking back at what you\u2019re talking with the focus on cost, we had costs in the program a year-ago, but it was less weighted. We moved the cost side to 50% this year, because we are trying to drive two things in 2013. One is our routing and logistics program and operating costs, so I\u2019ll take a step back. We\u2019ve always said to get that 300 basis points, we\u2019re going to get 100 basis points at SG&A from the reorganization which we\u2019ve gotten, we then going to get 100 basis points out of operating costs, which is our routing and logistics program, and then we are going to turn back to SG&A and get another 100 basis points after back-office consolidation.", "So we\u2019ve gotten the reorganization, we\u2019re now in phase 2 where we need to get 100 basis points out of our routing and logistics program. We also need to maintain that 130 that we got out of the reorganization. So we wanted to put a little bit more weighting on cost this year, because that\u2019s where the focus is going to be. The focus is going to be in two places, price and cost in 2013 and there is not going to be anything else, lot of other things matter, but that\u2019s going to be the two things that are going to drive profitability and frankly when you look back at our best years of profitability from 2005 to 2008, that\u2019s what drove it then.", "So we decided to put a large waiting that I talked about earlier on that incentive for the pricing side and then we decided to take 50% of the annual bonus and put it on the cost side to make sure that everybody is focused.", "And then what we did was we made the field portion is based on operating costs, so they\u2019ll be focused on implementing our routing and logistics programs. The corporate side is on SG&A, so that we don\u2019t give away that $130 million benefit that we got last year. So we think that creates a good balance between cost and growth, but we certainly want to make sure that folks are focused on both cost and price in 2013.", "James C. Fish, Jr.", "Joe, just to touch on the last part of your question there about providing a disincentive there, that\u2019s why we do it on a percent of revenue, OpEx as a percent of revenue. We certainly don\u2019t want to discourage our area leaders from growing their business with things like oilfield services, but we just don\u2019t want them to grow to top line while they dilute their margins.", "Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Understood; thanks. Could you may be just give us a little bit of historical context on this bid pricing that you\u2019ve referred to and may be just talk for the timing and willingness to recycling customers to may be accept those price increases?", "David P. Steiner", "Sure. So when we did what we call a business improvement process, what we did was we went out and found the true cost to service our customers. And what we found was about 20% of our customers were actually underwater. And you know I think it\u2019s a fundamental premise of pricing that when you got a customer that\u2019s underwater, you can be a little bit more aggressive trying to raise their price right, because if they leave you, you are not overly disappointed when you are losing unprofitable customer.", "And so we went through that process, like I say about 80% of our customers accepted the price increase and those price increases were in the 15% to 25% range. So some fairly dramatic price increases. Look, we gave away $130 million to $150 million last year in recycling, because commodity prices were down, our margins went down, our return on capital went down, and we need to make sure that our customer share some of that, plan and simple.", "So we need to go out and find those unprofitable customers that we\u2019ve got in our system and we need to make them profitable or let them lead the system. I think that we will be able to retain them while driving up the profitability, but we need to go through that process.", "Now, it is a completely different process to go through it from a recycling point of view than it was from a commercial point of view, because obviously you\u2019ve got a lot of commercial customers and you have an opportunity to do price increases under the contract at any particular point in time.", "On the recycling side, it won\u2019t b quite so easy. We do have fewer contracts, but many of those contracts don\u2019t allow the type of price movement that we would like to get, so we got to wait for them to roll off. And so, we are in the process right now of doing that analysis, understanding who are profitable and unprofitable customers are and then understanding when we can take the pricing actions to bring them back to profitability.", "Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Sure. And then I guess we had to ballpark it, I mean do you have a sense of what percentage of your customers would possibly qualify for this?", "David P. Steiner", "It would be hard to ballpark it, but I would tell you, you just think about 8 million tons we processed and $130 million that we lost and you can start to see what kind of price increases you need to get, right. I mean, look, we are not in the recycling business to loose money. We believe that absolutely we want to be in the recycling business long-term, because our customers increasingly are demanding it, and we can extract more value out of that material, we can make great money when commodity prices are up. We just need to make sure that we also make more money when commodity prices are down and that\u2019s where we are going to go through and make sure it occurs in 2013.", "Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Understood. Thanks for your time.", "David P. Steiner", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for question-and-answers today. I would now like to turn the conference back to David Steiner for closing remarks.", "David P. Steiner", "Thank you all for joining us today. As I think you can see we\u2019re pretty optimistic about 2013. We completely recognize that first and foremost Waste Management is a cash generating company. And in 2013, we\u2019re going to get back to generate that $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion of free cash. And in 2014, we\u2019re going to get back to generating $1.2 billion plus and growing it over time.", "So we\u2019ve got a team that is fully committed to the process. We\u2019ve got a team that understands the plan, and we got incentive plans that are going to drive exactly that behavior. So we look forward to a good 2013 and a great 2014 and we\u2019ll see you all on the road during the year.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the express written consent of Waste Management is prohibited.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Waste Management\u2019s President and CEO, David Steiner.", "David Steiner", "Thanks, Ed and good morning from Houston. During the second quarter, our earnings per share grew to $0.54, overcoming $0.03 of unexpected headwind. We had a negative $0.02 additional headwind from our recycling operations and a negative $0.01 from litigation settlements. Without these headwinds we would have earned $0.57 per share close to 10% earnings growth. Our disciplined approach to improving price, reducing cost and managing capital expenditures is reflected in this earnings growth and in our free cash flow.", "So we are pleased with our results of the second quarter and year-to-date which are right on plan despite the negative impact from our recycling business. The story of our quarter is that we had very strong results in our traditional solid waste operations but overall results were muted by unexpected headwinds in our recycling business. Even with these headwinds our operating EBITDA margins grew by 20 basis points.", "In our traditional solid waste business we grew income from operations margins by 80 basis points driven by our yield and cost program. We expect this margin expansion to continue throughout 2013 and to accelerate into 2014. Volumes improved sequentially in all of our collection lines of business, except recycling and roll-off. We offset roll-off volumes losses with very strong yield which drove 90 basis points of margin expansion in our roll-off business. In our recycling business we expected the second quarter impact to be a negative $0.03 to earnings per share. The actual result was a negative $0.05.", "Looking out to the third and fourth quarters we originally expected a positive $0.04 impact on earnings per share when compared to 2012 from our recycling operations. We now think that the impact from our recycling operations will be flat year-over-year in the second half of 2013. Thus, we now expect the full year negative impact of $0.08 per share versus the negative $0.2 per share we had originally anticipated.", "Many of you heard about the Chinese Green Fence which is affecting our recycling operations. The Chinese government has recently begun to enforce limits on moisture and non-conforming materials in imported fiber and plastics. The higher quality expectations have translated into additional labor and maintenance costs to remove residual waste from the recycle of materials that we process for our customers. It has also resulted in fewer volumes to sell because of the higher residual material that in turn has reduced revenue and increased residual disposal costs. So you can see why the green fence has had a negative effect on the results of our recycling operations.", "As we discussed we have been implementing a business improvement plan in our recycling line of business. First, we will be working with our customers to improve the quality of the inbound streams of material. Our contracts with many large customers limit the amount of residue in the recyclables they delivered to us. We will be working with them to ensure compliance with these limits or we will charge them to cover our increased costs.", "Second, we are modifying our operating procedures to reduce costs and residual waste. Finally we will also look at each of our recycling facilities and rationalize those that continue to lose money. Our municipal, commercial and industrial customers want to recycle their waste materials. We have the best assets in the industry to support that desire but we will do so with the pricing and operating strategy that supports both our customers and our shareholders.", "Our solid waste pricing programs had a very positive impact in the second quarter of 2013. Yield from our collection and disposal operations was 2.1%. This is the highest yield since the first quarter of 2011 and we have seen yield improve sequentially for four consecutive quarters. If you add in our fuel surcharge and adjust for our South Florida waste-to-energy plants, we achieved yield of 2.6%. We achieved core price of 3.6%, an increase of 110 basis points in the second quarter of 2012. It\u2019s worth noting that the uptick in yield more than offset the reduction in volumes. So our pricing program is working very well.", "During the first quarter we mentioned the steps that we\u2019re taking to improve yield and in the second quarter we saw positive results. Average rates for both commercial and industrial new business pricing exceeded lost business pricing for the second consecutive quarter. Service increases on our commercial business exceeded decreases for the first time since the third quarter of 2010. And price roll backs are down almost two-thirds from the peak in the fourth quarter of 2011.", "Our pricing momentum continued to build in the second quarter. In our commercial line of business we have the highest yield that we\u2019ve seen since 2011 at 3.1%. Importantly our pricing actions didn\u2019t reduce in the commercial line. In fact volumes improved slightly over the first quarter of 2013. On the industrial side we did not see volume growth in our industrial line, with volumes down 1.2% for the quarter. What we did see in our industrial line of business was a yield of 4.8% which is the highest yield since Q1 of 2007.", "We also saw the highest new business pricing that we have ever seen in our roll-off line of business. The (inaudible) roll-off customers, some value service and quality and some value price. We are clearly more focused on obtaining higher margin customers that value service and quality. And we simply won\u2019t chase low margin roll-off business. And the trade up is very positive, in both our commercial and industrial lines of business we saw margins expand by a 100 basis point.", "So we\u2019ve focused on core price increases and we\u2019ve moved core price close to 4%. In future quarters we will continue that focus but we will also turn our attention to fees and surcharges. When you look at our average customers overtime the combination of fees and surcharge is between 20% and 30% of the total bill. So every time we waive the fees and surcharges it\u2019s the equivalent of giving a 20 to 30 price decrease versus the opportunity.", "Increasingly we\u2019ve seen our competition offer to waive fees and surcharges, particularly in the roll-off line of business. When we matched that action it equates to the 20% to 30% roll back of prices which dwarfs a 4% core price increase. So in the second half of 2013 we will focus on obtaining the fees and surcharges. With fuel and environmental compliance cost growing drastically over the years this is the only way that we can ensure we cover our increasing cost, so that our other program margin can drive margin expansion.", "Overall volumes were negative 0.6% in the second quarter. But it\u2019s important to note that one of the main drivers of the declining volume was under a cycling business. Recycling volumes were down almost 1%, a notable swing from recent increases in the range of 6% to 8%. Volumes have been impacted by China\u2019s Green Fence initiatives. And we\u2019ve also seen several large new plants pass their first year anniversary.", "In both our commercial and residential lines of business we saw a sequential improvement in the rate of declining volumes for the third consecutive quarter. For the second half of the year we don\u2019t expect volumes to change much from the second quarter. That assumes slightly negative collection volumes. But our increase in yield should more than make up for the lower volumes. In our waste to energy business average electricity pricing improved almost 5% in the second quarter when compared to the second quarter of 2012. We also saw improved SG&A expenses. These improvements basically offset an increase in repair and maintenance cost due to the timing of outages.", "Overall the waste-to-energy business was basically flat for the quarter and the first half of 2013, when compared to the second quarter and first half of 2012. We still expect the full year impact on earnings per share from our waste-to-energy operations to be approximately a negative $0.02 share compared to 2012.", "In summary we had greater than expected recycling headwinds from the second quarter, but we overcame. Consequently we\u2019re on plan for the first two quarter of 2013. We overcame the headwinds through good cost controls and an IRG that is more weighted to price than volume. We expect that our continued execution on yield and cost will help us manage against the $0.08 per share of recycling headwinds that we anticipate for the full year.", "Accordingly we still expect to achieve full year guidance of between $2.15 and $2.20 of adjusted fully diluted earnings per share and free cash flow of between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion. This quarter clearly shows how well our field operations can perform when they are focused on the right items. In the past few years we diluted some of the messages to our field operations but this year we asked them to focus on two things, yield and cost and in the second quarter they delivered on both.", "Our overall IRG was right where we expected it to be but weighted more toward price than volumes which is a very positive fact. Jim will talk about our cost programs. When it comes to yield we put the plans in place and our core business field leaders are doing a superb job in executing the plan. We are focused on adding volumes in the higher margin lines of business like our Landfill and Commercial lines. In our lower margin lines of business we are either going to improve their profitability or we are going to disinvest in them.", "Given cost inflation, we must have better pricing to drive sustainable margin expansion in these lower margin lines. We simply will not chase volumes at inadequate prices. For example we have not bid on a number of residential contracts and in those that we do bid we are generally bidding higher prices. This may cost us some volumes. But losing volumes on a low margin line of business can be a very smart move to drive returns on capital. This is particularly true in the residential line of business that on a non-integrated basis contributes about 15% of our collection earnings but takes up over 40% of our fleet capital spend.", "In the temporary roll-off business, many competitors are willing to put their teams to work at a low price. We will not do that. As I mentioned our new business pricing in our roll-off line has hit its highest level in the history of our company. The 100 basis points improvement in margins in our collection business reflects the success of this trade-off of price versus volume. Obviously if we are going to charge higher prices we need to provide greater value by being a service leader and we have a number of programs designed to give great value to those higher priced customers.", "We are constantly trying to improve the value delivered to the prices we charge and we will continue to add programs for those customers to make their experience the best in the industry.", "I will now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our second quarter results in more detail.", "James Fish", "Thank you, David. I will start by discussing our strong SG&A and cash flow performance then I will expand on David\u2019s comments about results of operations from our traditional solid waste business and yield and volume in our various lines of business. I will conclude with a discussion of our financial metrics.", "In our SG&A cost category we continue to see results of our restructuring and focus on controlling cost. SG&A cost were $353 million in the second quarter and 10% of revenue, an improvement of $21 million and an 80 basis point improvement compared to the second quarter 2012 as a percent of revenue. The two biggest areas of savings came from labor due to our restructuring last year and our focus on lower controllable cost. These savings were partially muted by $30 million incremental compensation plan accrual that did not occur in 2012.", "Bad debt expense improved SG&A cost by $8 million due to the partial collection of a receivable at our Puerto Rico operation. Additionally, DSO improved sequentially. In fact we improved DSO sequentially for three consecutive quarters. We are pleased with the second quarter SG&A results but we still have a lot of work in front of us to achieve our full year goals.", "In the third quarter we expect approximately $45 million of headwind in SG&A from incentive compensation accruals. We only have $30 million in the second quarter of 2013. However for the full year we still anticipate achieving our goal of flat SG&A costs when compared to full year of 2012.", "Turning to cash flow, second quarter 2013 net cash provided by operating activities was $545 million. This is a decrease of $124 million compared to the second quarter of 2012. In 2013 we had $117 million increase in taxes paid based on our higher income and the timing of estimated tax payments. In 2012, we benefited from $72 million of proceeds from swap terminations. Cash from operations was very strong. Net of those two items cash from operations would have been up $65 million.", "Our capital expenditures for the second quarter were $235 million, an improvement of $116 million compared to the second quarter of 2012. We remain disciplined on ensuring that we spend capital on assets that fit within our long-term strategy. As we have mentioned in the past we are also looking at rationalizing our asset base. For instance, during the quarter we recorded an impairment charge on a disposal facility that was cash flow negative. When we closed the facility we will move the volume to another waste management facility so that we maintain the associated revenue.", "Putting all of this together our free cash flow for the quarter was $347 million, an increase of $15 million compared to the second quarter 2012. Year-to-date free cash flow increased $261 million to $695 million. If you exclude proceeds from sale of assets free cash flow was $621 million year-to-date and puts us well on the way to achieving our goal of generating between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion of free cash flow for the year.", "We returned $171 million to our shareholders through our second quarter dividends. We invested $30 million on acquisitions and we repaid $290 million in debt. Our pricing programs are improving each of our collection lines of business as well as our overall results. Yield on our collection in disposal operations grew 2.1% in the second quarter. Our yield growth for the second quarter of 2013 would have been 2.6% if you include the fuel surcharge and adjust for the change in pricing at our waste energy plants in south Florida.", "In the third quarter we will see a portion of our contract reset price again on tip fees in our South Florida waste energy business where a competitor took some volumes at about 40% per ton reduction from our rates. Combined internal revenue growth from yield in our collection business was 2.9% in the second quarter with 4.8% growth in industrial, 3.1% growth in commercial and 1.5% growth in residential.", "The industrial yield is the highest that we have seen since the first quarter of 2007 and for the commercial line of business it\u2019s the highest since 2011. The increase in yield has not had a significant impact on collection volumes as the commercial and residential lines of business saw sequential improvement in the rate of decline of volume loss. In landfill line of business we achieved MSW yield of 1.8%.", "Moving to volumes, internal volume growth was negative 0.6 in the quarter. The decline was primarily driven by a decrease in recycled volumes as David mentioned. We saw collection volume decline by 1.4% although the rate of decline on collection volume slowed. More specifically commercial volumes declined 2.7%, industrial volumes declined 1.2% and residential declined 1.1%.", "In our landfill line of business volumes were positive 6.6%. MSW volumes grew by 6.3% primarily from increased Oakleaf vendor hauler volumes and special waste volumes grew 5% as our pipeline for jobs remains strong. We also saw strong volumes from revenue generating cover and C&D tons. When you look at our overall operating results our income from operations margin was flat at 14.8% when compared to the second quarter 2012.", "As David mentioned our traditional solid waste business Collection, landfill, and transfer stations had a very good quarter. Income from operations in those lines of business increased $47 million and income from operations margins increased 80 basis points. The collection lines of business drove most of the income from operations increase.", "Both our commercial and industrial lines of business improved when compared to the second quarter of 2012. Residential business continues to be a challenge primarily in the South where contract changes in Florida related to the waste energy business drove a slight decline in income from operations.", "So the 80 basis point improvement in the traditional solid waste business was offset by a decline in recycling business. We have been very clear with our field operations that we must pass through the recycling increases to our customers in the coming quarters.", "Turning specifically to operating expenses, the improvement that we saw in our traditional solid waste business was muted by an increase in operating expenses primarily from increased cost in our recycling operations and the timing of repair and maintenance at our waste energy facilities. These items were $35 million of our $51 million increase.", "We remain focused on controlling cost and expect to see improvement as we progress through the remainder of 2013. In fact when you look at our traditional solid waste business our maintenance costs were essentially flat when compared to the second quarter of 2012.", "Finally looking at our other financial metrics, at the end of the second quarter our weighted average cost of debt was 5.1% and our debt to total capital ratio was 58.9% consistent with our target of about 60%. Floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 10% at the end of the quarter. Overall the results of proceeding is expected as our pricing and cost control programs have allowed us to overcome that recycling headwinds in the first two quarters and remain on plan.", "The results of the first six months of 2013 have put us in position to achieve our yield, SG&A and earnings per share and free cash flow goal. We continue to take a strong stance on controlling SG&A cost. We saved $38 million year-to-date when compared to 2012, our stated goal for SG&A is to remain flat with 2012. Even though the third quarter comparison would be tough at $45 million of compensation accrual headwinds we still expect to meet our full year target.", "Similarly we\u2019re applying a very disciplined approach to capital management. Combining this with our focus on yield SG&A and our improvement in working capital and earnings we\u2019ve already generated $621 million of free cash flow exclusive of failed assets. This puts us more than half way to our goal. We will continue this disciplined approach in order to achieve our free cash flow goal of $21.1 billion and $1.2 billion for 2013. And with that Rochelle let\u2019s open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first line comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Credit Suisse.", "Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Good morning. Thank you.", "David Steiner", "Good morning Hamzah. And happy birthday by the way.", "Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Hey, thanks a lot. Appreciate it. The first question David is just on volume. It seems like the recycling business is 12% of revenue. It\u2019s not that big. You guys said that it\u2019s 1% down on volume. Is all of the volume loss or below volume relative to expectations, given what you\u2019re seeing with the rest of the sector. Is that all you guys just walking away from lower margin roll-off business or is there something else in that as well.", "David Steiner", "Yeah, I think that\u2019s basically \u2013 Hamzah I mean as we mentioned we got the highest new business pricing that we\u2019ve ever seen in the roll-off line of business. When you think about it, if you look at the roll-off line of business, as a 20% call or 20% margin business every time you get a new can, 20% of it drops to the bottom line, every time you get 1% price, a 100% drops to the bottom line. So you have to get 5% volume in order to make up for 1% price.", "What we saw in this quarter was basically you saw the quarter-to-quarter change in yield was 1.3%. In order for that to equate to a fair trade-off we have to get 7% volume. You can\u2019t do that in this business. And so we went around and talked to our folks out in the field and they said look we can go get roll-off volume if you want us to. But what we\u2019re going to do is we\u2019re going to mess up the market at a lower price and we\u2019re going to get low margins on it.", "We would much rather go out at higher price, offer good quality for what we\u2019re doing. And get that higher price roll-up volume, and as you can see that trade-off worked very well with 100 basis points of margin expansion.", "Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. And maybe if you could give us a sense of the lag that it may take the field organization in making the adjustments on the recycling business to get the surcharges and fees, how much of a lag do you think it\u2019s going to take the field to get rid \u2013 the recycling from sort of not being a margin headwind. Is this more of a two quarter lag or any sense of expectation there?", "David Steiner", "Yeah, I mean there are two sort of two pieces to the recycling business. There is the commercial recycling that as this closes we can get sort of the spot recycling if you will. And on those types of transactions we can change the price today and we got folks and teams out in the field just doing that.", "In other cases we have long term contracts with municipalities and other folks and we need to get through those contracts we need to understand what our rights under those contracts and We need to go and talk the customers. So it\u2019s there are pieces of it that we can do quickly, there are pieces of it that take time. I would say frankly Hamzah overall it\u2019s going to take little bit of time. But what we\u2019ve told our field operations is we don\u2019t have luxury of time right now. I mean we are losing money in our recycling operations, in most of our recycling operations we\u2019ve got to turn that around. We\u2019ve got to turn around now.", "Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And just last question from me. I\u2019ll turn it over. The land fill pricing it seems like that decelerated at 1.8% relative to sort of the mid 2% it was running. Could you maybe comment on that? Thank you.", "David Steiner", "Actually it was up in the quarter from prior quarters. Last time we saw yield that high was Q1 of \u201812 on the MSW line. But look, we talked about it very vocally that we need to get that sort of 5% to 7% increase of the land fill. That is like the recycling business in that you got lot of long term contracts. You have to work through those issues. And we\u2019re absolutely working through those issues. We will not back down on our 5% to 7% price increase.", "Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thanks a lot.", "David Steiner", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question from the line of Bill Fisher with Raymond James.", "William Fisher \u2013 Raymond James", "Good morning.", "David Steiner", "Good morning, Bill.", "William Fisher \u2013 Raymond James", "Hey, first of, Jim, you mentioned I think, I just want to make sure I had the numbers right of operating cost increase like 30 million of it was Wheelabrator maintenance and recycling, is that roughly right?", "James Fish", "About 35 million was a combination of the one-time Wheelabrator advance maintenance events and recycle.", "William Fisher \u2013 Raymond James", "So the rest of it you did a math roughly was the cost was only up 1% or so you had good cost control on the rest of it.", "James Fish", "Yeah, you know, one thing, Bill that we have talked a bit about in previous quarters was maintenance cost. Actually in our traditional on our core business, maintenance costs have improved by 11 basis points, so while it\u2019s not where we want to be, we are starting to move in the right direction.", "William Fisher \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay, great, then quickly on the acquisitions and divestitures did you \u2013 I thought I saw in that Quebec papers, did you guys were able to close that RCI transaction?", "David Steiner", "Are you able to read the Quebec papers?", "William Fisher \u2013 Raymond James", "Yeah, I had to translate it but that\u2019s what it looked like.", "David Steiner", "Yes, we did, we closed it early July.", "William Fisher \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay, and any rough hand on what the annualized revenues on that would be?", "David Steiner", "Yeah, the annualized revenue is roughly a 170 million.", "William Fisher \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay.", "David Steiner", "Bill, when we had actually intended to close that, we had an agreement to close that for quite a while. When we gave our full year guidance we actually expected to close that at the beginning of the year, not in the middle of the year. So it is baked into our guidance but it will be a great acquisition for us. Lucien Remillard built a spectacular business up there and we are looking forward to leveraging the great company that he built.", "William Fisher \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay, you have some decent overlap on the hauling side too, or do you not have that?", "David Steiner", "Well, you know frankly this is sort of a minnow swallowing the whale, we have a fairly small presence from a collection point of view in the Montreal market area. RCI had a much bigger presence. So we are going to keep the RCI brand in Montreal.", "William Fisher \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay, great thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question from the line of Corey Greendale with First Analysis.", "Corey Greendale \u2013 First Analysis", "Hi, good morning.", "David Steiner", "Good morning.", "Corey Greendale \u2013 First Analysis", "First question I want to ask about the price, so given that it is moving in the right direction would you say that you have most of the pricing actions kind of fully baked in Q2 so we should expect a similar level price in Q3 or would there still be some acceleration as you keep implementing that stuff.", "David Steiner", "Yeah, you know, the regulatory cost recovery fee we did not, we did not get a full quarter benefit out of it in this quarter because we implemented it sort of in mid quarter. But we will also have you know, some head wins coming in the back half of the year from CPI, from the reset contracts in Florida. All in all I will call it sort of a wash. We said in the beginning of the year that we would be at sort of 1 to 1.5 % yield for the first half of the year we were at 1.7%. I now expect that for the full year we would probably be at that 1.5% to 2 % type of range.", "You know, there are a couple of factors that come into the second half of the year that lead me to not try to say we are going to see dramatic acceleration but I can promise you from a total dollars to the bottom line we haven\u2019t taken our foot off the pedal.", "Corey Greendale \u2013 First Analysis", "In the sense how much of that 2% yield from the regulatory recovery would be?", "David Steiner", "Just about $8 million in a quarter.", "Corey Greendale \u2013 First Analysis", "Right. And you talked about the non-compliance in some cases with the fees and surcharges, can you put some kind of parameters on that, like how much of an \u2013 what percentage the customer base is compliant with that and what kind of opportunities to get to get closer to 100% compliance?", "David Steiner", "Yeah, I mean look the opportunity is tremendous, when I talked about it especially at 20 to 30% price decrease when you waive fees and surcharges. On a commercial line of business we are about 85% compliant, on the roll off line of business we are only about 55%, because basically what you have got, the roll off line of business, you know, it is a little bit baffling to me in the low margin line of business you see folks out there waiving fees and surcharges on the roll off line of business.", "So it is very competitive in the roll off line of business our compliance is about it, 55%, so you know just take 20% to 30% price roll back and add it back into that and you can see the dramatic effect that has on earnings.", "Corey Greendale \u2013 First Analysis", "On that front as you trying to see new entrants into that business or is it primarily the entrenched players that you are seeing being more aggressing and wait and see.", "David Steiner", "Well, you know, I think it is, I think that one is sort of across the board, I think there is obviously a lot of competition in the roll off line, it\u2019s very low barrier to entry. But I would say that it is sort of across the board. Generally what you have seen is that the smaller players sometimes don\u2019t even have the fees and surcharges, the larger players generally are the ones that will roll it back.", "Corey Greendale \u2013 First Analysis", "Okay, and then just a quick housekeeping one for Jim? Jim, what would you suggest the tax rate for the back half of the year?", "James Fish", "We obviously we are going to approach the statutory rate of 35% and I will stick to that.", "Corey Greendale \u2013 First Analysis", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.", "Usha Gunthapally \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Good morning. This is actually Usha Gunthapally on behalf of Alex Ovshey. How are you?", "David Steiner", "Good morning, doing well.", "Usha Gunthapally \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Great. Just on the CapEx expectation for full year 2013 the run rate so far seems to be below your initial guidance. How do you think about a lower bound?", "James Fish", "Well I would say that we are still on track to hit our guidance of 1.3 to 1.4. Typically we see an acceleration of capital spending in the second half of the year. So it may look like if you straight line it you are going to get 1.3 to 1.4 range. We will more than likely see an acceleration in the second half as we always do and end up right within the range.", "Usha Gunthapally \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it, and one more. So on roll back in second quarter they were lower by 45% year-on-year without increasing the churn rate. Does this imply improved pricing discipline in the industry generally?", "David Steiner", "No, I don\u2019t think there is any doubt. You know I mean look, we can\u2019t particularly speak for the industry. We can only speak for what we do and I can promise you that there is absolutely no doubt there has been increased discipline with our folks as far as rolling back prices and look it\u2019s a tribute to our sales folks and to our training folks who you know this doesn\u2019t happen just by putting an edict out that we are not going to rollback prices. There is lot of training that goes into it, lot of preparation goes into, there is lot of work by our customer service reps that go into it and they have done a phenomenal job turning it frankly that fast.", "Usha Gunthapally \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it, and any expectation for second half on roll-off fees?", "David Steiner", "Yeah, generally roll-off or rollbacks?", "Usha Gunthapally \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Rollback. Sorry.", "David Steiner", "Yeah, generally rollbacks do pick up a little bit in the back half of the year but we are doing a nice job of holding the line and I wouldn\u2019t expect to see it materially change. It could pick up a little bit but I wouldn\u2019t expect to see it materially change.", "Usha Gunthapally \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it, thank you.", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital.", "Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Really nice job on the SG&A front. I understand you guys reiterated your flat year-over-year guidance and I guess that makes sense with comps getting tougher in 3Q and accruals sequentially ramping. I am just curious if you maybe give us a little more color on how much flexibility you have toward that flat guidance? You know is that a stretch or are you thinking you could actually put up better SG&A margin given improvement you have seen so far?", "David Steiner", "You know Joe I would say it\u2019s not a huge stretch but it\u2019s also I don\u2019t think we have a whole lot of room there either. I think we are probably pretty comfortable with flat year-over-year which is saying something considering you know the comp headwinds that we have faced. So I think we are probably on track to hit the flat guidance with 2012 that we have given.", "Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay and switching gear to the recycling side. I am sure we could probably back into the so I just want to check. Can you just flush out with the swing in recycling volumes ended up contributing to the 60 basis points of volume degradation that you had?", "David Steiner", "Yeah we will run that calculation for you and check it and get the number to you.", "Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay, yeah that will be helpful. And then\u2026", "David Steiner", "But frankly speaking I don\u2019t know how to do that complicated math.", "Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Was there any difference then between your internal marks, what you saw from the volume basis there or your broker volumes or was it basically one and the same?", "David Steiner", "It was basically one and the same.", "Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Great, that\u2019s all from me. Thanks.", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "James Fish", "Thanks, Joe.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Wunderlich Securities.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Good morning and thank you for taking my call.", "David Steiner", "Hey, Michael.", "James Fish", "Good morning, Michael.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "How are you doing, David, Jim? Can we just push on the volume subject a little bit? I get the model. You are going to push price and you are willing to push some less marginal volume away but if I look at the business that you have got in place and kept to customer what\u2019s happening on the volume and those customers?", "David Steiner", "You mean As far as weights or\u2026?", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Yeah like I mean it\u2019s like in your front end water business are you seeing container rates starting to rise? Because I wouldn\u2019t think you would push this pricing forever if you didn\u2019t think the macro volume environment was gradually improving as well.", "David Steiner", "Yeah I don\u2019t think there is any doubt that we\u2019re seeing improvements in the commercial line of business. Again it\u2019s not dramatic but it\u2019s consistent and so we saw waste up frankly across all of our collection lines in the quarter, obviously was a very wet quarter so that added some to the waste. But the other thing that is very encouraging to me is what we mentioned about service increases and service decreases for the second quarter in row we\u2019ve seen service increases outpace service decreases which tells you that, yeah there was some wet weather in the second quarter but we are seeing the customers start move up to larger containers.", "So again like we said in the past we\u2019re not going to declare victory it\u2019s certainly a long slog for us to get there but in the commercial line of business we actually are seeing some very good sign.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "And then if I parsing the customers at the land fill so third party delivering C&D is that on a rise which would be consistent with the sort of improving construction environment?", "James Fish", "Yeah we saw C&D volumes up in the quarters I recall around 4.5% that side, yes 4.5%. So across the land fill we\u2019re seeing actually very good volumes. We saw volumes up nicely on the MSW side, C&D were both up. And so if you look it comes back to what I said in the script.", "If you are going to add volumes let\u2019s add them in the right line of business and if you\u2019re going to be aggressive on the pricing must be aggressive on pricing in those low margin lines of business where the only way you are going to drive look it takes a long time to drive cost out of this system. And so you are never going to get margin expansion if all you are going to do is drive cost. And so in those low margin lines we absolutely have to raise price.", "And like I said the five to one trade off in a 20% line of business is well worth it, when you think about residential line of business call it 10 to 15% margin. If there was 10% margin customer you can gain 1% volume and 1% price and lose 10% of your volume and still be equal. By the way price comes without any capital investment. So this is, Michael this is not any different than what we did from 2004 through 2008. It\u2019s what I said \u2013 script I think we got the message to the field a little bit mixed the last couple of years and we got them unfocused on price and cost. We got it back. You saw some progress in it this quarter. We still got a long way to go. But I think you are going to see it accelerate throughout 2013 and 2014.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "So where I would connect the dots between your comments and my question, there is a point of operating leverage it just starts to accelerate as macro volumes continue to improve, you continue to be successful on this price as well as the discipline around the G&A what\u2019s your thoughts about the visibility on that? Where are we, are you away from that we just \u2013 away from that where is that?", "David Steiner", "Well look I am encourage that we saw the EBITDA margins turned positive this quarter. Look I will tell you Jim talked about the flat SG&A guidance for the rest of the year. Jim Fish and Jim Trevathan have done a phenomenal job on holding the line on SG&A cost. So I don\u2019t expect to see SG&A cost to go up materially this year or next year frankly.", "And so we got to drive operating costs out of the system. We\u2019re starting to get a little bit of traction on that. And I think what we saw was look the biggest leverage is always going to come from yield in this business and I think you saw start to get some traction back in that in the quarter. So all we need is for the economy to continue to improve so that we don\u2019t the dramatic volume drop as we saw in 2009. And I think you\u2019ve begun to see the leverage in the operating model I think you should see that accelerate in the next 18 months.", "James Fish", "One quick point Michael on operating expenses as David talked about I mentioned that a big slog of that operating expense was related to I think when you think about the leverage going forward if we can\u2019t squeeze that operating cost out that\u2019s related to this quality control from China and we plan to pass it through to our customers. And that in itself helps us to reduce operating expenses as a percent of revenue.", "David Steiner", "It\u2019s a great point. Every penny we improve in recycling drags straight through the bottom line and there is lot of room for improvement there right now.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Okay. So my last documentation on this, it sounds like if I take the bonus accruals for this year plus the headwinds from bonus depreciation but net it against the success you are having on G&A, pricing and operating leverage, you should be able to produce flat year-over-year free cash flow maybe even a teeny bit of growth given those two cash headwinds.", "David Steiner", "You know Michael we are waiting for 2014 to give the guidance but look I said all along this is a business that should generate $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion the free cash flow come hell and high water. You know look we didn\u2019t do that last year, that\u2019s not going to happen again. The other thing that I can say that Jim and Jim have been phenomenal at is the capital discipline and we are going to manage the capital such that we make this at least to $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion free cash flow company every year come hell or high water I wouldn\u2019t expect that to change next year.", "James Fish", "Michael did you say we are flat for 2014 versus 2013, are you saying flat?", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Yeah.", "James Fish", "All right.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Yeah flat so in \u201814 you should do 1.1 to 1.2 again even with those headwinds given the leverage from your price and your cost controls.", "James Fish", "Yeah I just want to make sure because 2012 to 2013 there is going to be a dramatic improvement in free cash flow.", "David Steiner", "All right Michael, you snuck 2014 guidance out of us but I will give it to you. We are going to do at least 1.1 to 1.2 in 2014.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "There you go. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with BB&T Capital Markets.", "Adam Thalhimer \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Hi, thanks. Good morning guys.", "David Steiner", "Good morning.", "James Fish", "Good morning.", "Adam Thalhimer \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "The green fence cost do you think that is permanent and how long should it take to get to pass those cost on your customers?", "David Steiner", "Yeah you know we have looked a lot at this and as you can imagine it\u2019s been a big topic of conversation and you know there is so much international trade involved that it\u2019s hard to get really good visibility but we have sort of decided that we need to take the approach that it is going to be if not permanent at least long term.", "You know we can\u2019t sit back and say well we are just going to let the business continue the way it\u2019s been in the past and wait for the green fence to clear and everything is going to be alright. We are not going to take that approach. And if we are not going to take that approach we absolutely have to start driving cost out of the system and going back to our customers and getting our customers to pay for the increased cost that we are incurring for the reduced commodity prices.", "So you know look I will tell you I don\u2019t even want to try to put guess on the timeframe to when recycling gets back to where we wanted to be. All I can tell us is that we need to see incremental improvement every quarter and we got the plans in place to do that.", "Adam Thalhimer \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "And how are the recycling contracts structured? I mean how? Do they come up once every five years so it\u2019s hard to push price or how hard is it to push price I guess is the question?", "David Steiner", "Yeah I mean it depends on the customer, right? So we have got plenty of commercial recycling customers that are just like our regular commercial customers where we can change the price immediately and then we got other customers that are municipal customers where the contracts are going to be more to three to five year type traditional municipal contracts. And so what we have done is we have asked every one of our operations to get their top contracts.", "Let\u2019s start with those, let\u2019s go with the dollars first and let\u2019s go to our biggest contracts in every one of our market areas and start going to those customers and you know most of those contracts are going to allow us in some manner to either pass on increased price lower rebates or high processing cost and so let\u2019s go after the big ones and let\u2019s make sure that we go out and talk with those customers to cover our increased cost. And then on the other side the non-contracted customers like our commercial customers we run a couple of pilots to look at what we can do from a pricing point of view there and we are going to spread those across the country.", "Look, from a commercial recycling customer point of view it\u2019s going to be a lot of places where they are going to have a decision to make. They are either going to have to pay us more to recycle or they are going to have to move back away from recycling and just use disposal can and so we got to do that. It\u2019s certainly not something that we relish doing but you know we need to have the customers to make the decision on what they want us to do from a recycling the materials point of view.", "James Fish", "Adam, one quick point here on these contracts. Well it may sound difficult to change the price, many of these contracts have residual percentages in them and many of these contracts have composition components to them so we\u2019re going to go and look and see whether and we\u2019ll hold these customers for their contracts. If their residual percentage is 10% and we\u2019re getting 20% ahead of their contract then we\u2019re going to go back to them and have a discussion. And similarly if we expect to get the certain percentage of glass by weight out of a municipality we\u2019re getting a much bigger percentage of glass. And then we\u2019ll also go back and have a discussion with them.", "Adam Thalhimer \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Hope you\u2019re successful, right. Because that doesn\u2019t seem like the trend is going to slow down. I mean imagine your commercial customers are going to continue to recycle. Just the matter of you being able to push price, right?", "David Steiner", "Absolutely they\u2019re going to continue to recycle and we look forward to help them recycle.", "Adam Thalhimer \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "All right. And one more question I hate to ask. Because I know you\u2019re not focused for analyst trying to plug numbers into model I mean more of your thoughts on volume growth in the back-half.", "David Steiner", "Yeah, obviously no one knows of the future holds. But beginning of the year we said we were going to have positive volumes obviously in the second quarter. What you saw in the second quarter was recycling driving the both of the \u2013 I don\u2019t know if we got the number yet. But we saw recycling driving the bulk of the decrease in volumes and the only other line of business where we saw negative volumes on the roll off side where volumes were negative 1.2%. Now about half of that was the anniversary of the large national account that we brought up.", "So it\u2019s not like you\u2019re seeing volumes follow up the face of the earth and sort of like that. But we didn\u2019t expect the volume decline in recycling. And we don\u2019t expect to see our roll off line bounce back to where we\u2019re getting usual cost of volumes because we\u2019re not just going to change the margin of business. So for the back half of the year I think we\u2019re looking at volumes similar to what we saw in the second quarter.", "But look basically what you saw in the second quarter is our volumes went down 0.5% and our price went up 0.5%. And if I can get our price 0.5% and our volume down 0.5% I\u2019ll take that trade off six days to Sunday.", "Adam Thalhimer \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay. Great color. Thank you.", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line Jeff Osborne with Stifel.", "Jeffery Osborne \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Co.", "Good morning two quick questions for you David. On the green sided the rules have been in place for quite some times. My understanding but is the enforcement from China stepped up over the past couple of months. Is that part of the issue of play here?", "David Steiner", "Yeah with the change in premiers in China you saw, early this year you saw basically a declaration by them across all sort of type of environmental initiatives. And so even though the regulations been on the books they finally just passed I mean not just passed they just mandated that they\u2019re going to enforce those regulations. Basically in February this year.", "Jeffery Osborne \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Co.", "Understand. And then on the M&A side just what you\u2019re seeing out there in terms of either tuck ins or potentially getting the oil and gas which I think you talked about at the Waste Expo conference.", "David Steiner", "Yeah. We just closed as we mentioned our RCI deal in Montreal that was obviously a fairly a large deal for us. Other than that we\u2019re just looking at sort of our typical smaller tuck in acquisition. On the oil and gas side we closed the small acquisition there. We\u2019re constantly looking for further acquisitions. But that\u2019s been a fairly pricing market. So I don\u2019t anticipate that we\u2019ll spend a lot of money there.", "At this point in time I\u2019d say we\u2019re through the largest acquisition that we had in the pipeline. RCI was basically the final one of those. And now we\u2019ll back to sort of our typical $100 million to $200 million of tuck in acquisition.", "Jeffery Osborne \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Co.", "Very good. Thank you very much.", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your final question coming from the line of Al Kaschalk with Wedbush.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "Good morning, David. Good morning, Tim.", "David Steiner", "Hey, Al.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "David, in terms of \u2013 I apologize I joined the call late. But have you commented on how the integration of RCS is going I know it\u2019s one month. But could you just comment.", "David Steiner", "Yeah, we didn\u2019t specifically comment it. But what we got in Montreal is that we have fairly small collection operation. And so we\u2019re basically tuck in operation into RCI. So far that\u2019s gone very well. RCI had some very high quality management there. So they\u2019ve done a great job of tucking our operations into theirs.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "And the interest of the acquisition was largely predicted on what. In terms of the opportunities that you see going forward. Besides that previously having a lot of collections operations there.", "David Steiner", "Yeah, I mean Montreal was a very fairly unique market for us. In that we had a lot of disposal capacity. But very little in the way of collection operations. We tried build up those collection operations over time but frankly they got some, they have one spectacular company there in RCI that made a difficult for us to get into the collection business and so we had a landfill that pre-recession was actually find because there was an excess of tonnage in the market and our landfill is fine.", "After the recession frankly there wasn\u2019t enough a tonnage in the landfill in the market to fill all the landfill and so we had a choice to make. We could either get deeper into the collection business to help feed our landfill network or we were going to see volumes deteriorate at our landfill and we were going to be at the mercy of other collection companies.", "And so it was a perfect tuck in acquisition for us it\u2019s a great market we\u2019ve been looking at it for a long time \u2013 I\u2019ve said earlier ran a great business and we look forward to continuing this success.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "This is an MSW landfill David or is there other ways can take?", "David Steiner", "No, it\u2019s MSW.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "Okay. And then finally if may and sorry this has been a topic that I missed. But on the SG& front you have talked about cost savings on the growth side of 120 million you did 10% I believe as a percentage of revenue in the quarter, how much of that benefit lock of better word is due to the lower recycling volumes and how much are you really on track to hit that growth target number?", "James Fish", "Due to the lower recycling volumes I wouldn\u2019t say any of its due to the lower recycling volumes. It\u2019s really due to two things, if I say there is several things in play but certainly the restructuring has had a big impact and we\u2019ve kind of gone over and above the restructuring by taking out a chunk of none labor SG&A as well throughout the year. So those are the two big components of our SG&A and we\u2019ve talked about not only holding flat from 2012 to 2013 but looking to hold flat from 2013 to 2014 in absolute dollars.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "So 353 dollar run rate is what you\u2019re suggesting we should think about in terms of Q3 forward.", "James Fish", "Well so Q3 has ad we talked about this a bit earlier but Q3 and Q4 have a bit of headwind with respect to compensation accruals year-over-year. So while we\u2019re up for the first two quarters of the year we expect we\u2019ll have a little bit of headwinds and that\u2019s why I think where we\u2019re comfortable saying that we\u2019ll be flat year-over-year.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "Jim my point about recycling is that. If prices are down then I would think that would hurt the operating margin on that business and there may be some I won\u2019t say idle cost but let\u2019s say not fully utilized cost. And that\u2019s what I am just giving trying to getting to an EBITDA margin of 25% I think is above that is easy hurdle. And then we just didn\u2019t see the progress in the quarters. So I am trying to decide for that whether that was an SG&A or an operating cost?", "James Fish", "It was operating cost at our recycling operations. We remember that had a 90 basis points effect on margin. So it was purely solid when it comes to recycling basically the breakdown you had is it the both of the problem with pricing and was pricing commodity pricings down 12.5% for the quarter. Next was operating cost, operating costs are up because we have to get lower residue and then you have the volume and the integration of the acquisitions pieces a little bit small pieces in there too.", "So look at the two bigger things are price and operating costs. And those are two things that we can affect and recycling you can affect from price by going and looking at rebate you can affect operating costs by driving the inefficiencies out of the system. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused on recycling. When we talked about margin expansion we are 20 basis points of EBITDA margin obviously that would have been back over 100 if we\u2019ve gotten just flat in recycling. Once we get to the point where we are positive from the recycling operations that\u2019s when you really see the leverage there.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "Okay. And you\u2019ve looked what\u2019s the assumption on commodity price David or Jim for the sort of back half of \u201813?", "James Fish", "We expect to be pretty much flat for the rest of the year you had to make your run up and we\u2019re expecting it sort of flat for the rest of the year.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Thank you Mr. Dave Steiner, do you have any closing remarks?", "David Steiner", "No, thank you all for joining us in the quarter and I know Jim and Jim will be out on the road in New York next week. So look forward to seeing you out on the road.", "Operator", "Thank you for participating in today\u2019s waste management conference call.

We\u2019re pleased with our results for the third quarter as our earnings per share increased 30% on an as reported basis and 6.6% as adjusted to $0.65 per share. At the beginning of the year we said that we would get back to basics by focusing on yield and cost controls. Our corporate and field managers have done just that and done it very well. On the cost side SG&A as a percent of revenue is 9.6%, the lowest since 2005. Our operating cost program continues to gain traction and should expurgate into 2014. On the yields side our results again show that focusing on yield works and we will continue to do so. Driven by the improved yield we expanded both income from operations and operating EBITDA margins in the quarter. Despite continued headwinds confronting our recycling and waste to energy businesses and modestly lower volumes.", "In the third quarter our overall income from operations grew $33 million and the overall income from operations margin grew 20 basis points. We also grew overall operating EBITDA by $46 million and overall operating EBITDA margin at 10 basis points. The results were even more impressive when you drill down into our traditional solid waste business where income from operations grew $71 million and the income from operations margin grew a 120 basis points while operating EBITDA grew by $74 million and operating EBITDA margin grew 90 basis points. This demonstrates the continued strength of our core solid waste business.", "In our recycling business we expected the third quarter impact to be a negative $0.01 to earnings per share. The recycling operations actually were of negative $0.02 effect on the quarter. In the quarter we saw a slight improvement in recycling commodity prices that was more than offset by increased cost from the operations of acquired businesses and the continued impact of the Chinese Green Fence.", "For fourth quarter recycling operations we had most recently projected a positive $0.01 impact on earnings per share when compared to 2012. We now think that the impact from our recycling operations will be approximately a negative $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter, which is slightly worse than Q3. That is a result of tougher year-over-year comparisons and relatively flat commodity prices when looking at our full basket of recycled commodities.", "So for the full year, we anticipate that the negative impact from recycling operations will be around $0.13 per share. The last two years at our recycling facilities have been characterized by low commodity prices and higher operating costs. We have incurred extra costs as we have had to reduce contamination from materials processed in our single stream plants to improve the quality of our bails to meet regulatory and customer requirements. In addition, recycling commodity prices can be volatile, which leads to volatile earnings in our recycling business. There is no quick easy solution for these challenges. So we are taking a variety of steps to increase earnings and decrease volatility. These solutions require us to change the way that we contract with our customers. Already, our areas are having more direct conversations with customers and are successfully decreasing rebate because of increased contamination levels in the customer\u2019s recycling streams, but we must do more.", "Going forward, our contracts will contain the following protections that we need in effort to earn an acceptable return on the capital that we have invested in our recycling business. First, many recycling contracts simply call for a split of the revenue from the sale of the commodities. This approach limits our ability to fully recover our processing costs when commodity prices are low. So our new contracts will call for us to be paid a processing fee before there is a split of revenue from commodity sales. However, when operating costs go up as they have under the Chinese Green Fence, we still risk losing money unless we can recover those increased costs. The single largest factor driving up processing cost is the level of contamination in the materials that we receive from our customers.", "So the second change we will make is that going forward, our customer contracts will have contamination limits. We will also require a mechanism to audit the inbound materials to ensure compliance with those limits. If the materials contain too much contamination, either we will recover a higher processing fee or we will reduce the rebate for the customer to cover our increased costs. We will also continue to educate our customers of the proper materials to placing their recycling wins through our recycle often recycle write program to try to reduce contamination rates.", "Third, our contracts need to have some flexibility to increase the processing charge or decrease rebates when outside business factors drive up our processing or other costs. So for example, if regulations like the Chinese Green Fence increase our costs, we should be able to pass-through incremental pricing to cover those costs.", "Finally, we need to do a better job of working with our customers to ensure that we can earn an acceptable return on commodities that are or that may become low value commodities. For example, today, we lose money recycling glass. In most locations, we have to pay a third-party to take the glass. For those types of materials, our contracts need to contain language that either allow us to pass along those increased cost to our customers or allow the customer to make a decision to remove a low value commodity from the recycling stream until such time as the commodity could be economically recycled. So as you can see, there is no easy fix in the recycling business. Our recycling contracts are generally three-year to five-year contracts. So over time, as more and more of our contracts contain these protections, we should see recycling return to being a more stable income producer that consistently earns a fair return on capital.", "Turning back to yield, our yield from our collection and disposal operations was 2.3%, the fifth consecutive quarter of sequential yield improvement and nearly triple the yield we saw in the third quarter of 2012. If you add in our fuel surcharge and adjust for our South Florida waste-to-energy plants, we achieved yield of 2.8%. We achieved core price of 3.9%, which is an increase of 160 basis points from the third quarter of 2012. This is our best core price performance just before 2010. We also saw the highest core price in over 10 years in the commercial and industrial lines of business and the second highest in the landfill line of business. Our yield increase in the quarter more than offset the loss in volumes resulting in overall growth in revenues and margins. The benefit of strong yield is most evident in our industrial line of business where we achieved the highest ever income from operations and income from operations margin despite negative volumes. This industrial income increase was driven by yield of 5.5% and core price of 8.4% which is the highest and nearly a decade. We have also intentionally shared low margin roll-out volumes and avoided adding low margin new business, repeatedly over the years. The yield versus volume trade-off always favored yields. In third quarter we proved this once again.", "Of course we want to retain our current customer base but we want to do so using tools other than price. We will focus on improving retention by providing customers with better service and higher value solutions but we will not chase volumes with low prices or large roll-backs.", "In our commercial and residential line of business we have the highest yield that we have seen since 2011. Commercial yield was 3.4% in the quarter and residential yield was 2%, finally MSW yield was the highest since 2010 at 1.9%.", "Taking the loan, the yield story is the great one but the bigger story is the increased income from operations and margins in each of these lines of business that are driven by increased yield. The commercial business saw increased margins of 40 basis points; industrial margins increased a 130 basis points. Residential margins increased 60 basis points and our landfill margins increased 80 basis points. We saw this margin growth even though volumes were down 0.6% in the quarter and down 1.3% on a work day adjusted basis.", "However the lower volumes were more than offset by higher yield. For the quarter recycling volumes declined 1.2% versus last year\u2019s high single digit growth. Our waste to energy volumes were down 3.2% primarily due to lower third party volumes at our South Florida plants.", "We also saw a modest sequential decline in volumes in our collection and landfill business. On the positive side we are encouraged to see that the service increases in our commercial business exceeded service decreases for the second consecutive quarter. In summary we maintained our disciplined approach to improving price, reducing cost and managing working capital and capital expenditures which is reflected in our third quarter results.", "We remain confident that we will achieve our goals despite an expected $0.13 per share of full year headwinds from our recycling operations which is $0.11 per share more than we anticipated at the beginning of the year. Based upon our year-to-date results we are confident that we can achieve our guidance range of between $2.15 and $2.20 of adjusted EPS. And with our strong free cash flow we\u2019re raising our free cash flow target by a $100 million to between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion. So we have laid a solid foundation in 2013, a foundation built-up yield and cost control and driven by our corporate and fields management who continue to perform at an extraordinary level.", "That foundation is serving us well in 2013 and we expect the foundation to continue to drive high single digit earnings growth in 2014. I will now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our third quarter results in more detail.", "", "Jim Fish", "Thank you David. I will start by discussing our SG&A cost and cash flow performance. Then I will expand on David\u2019s comments about the results of operations and volume in our various lines of business. I will conclude with a discuss of our financial metrics.", "Our SG&A as a percent of revenue was 9.6% of third quarter; this is the lowest expense since third quarter 2005. We improved SG&A as a percent of revenue by retaining the savings from our restructuring and focusing on control of cost. We did so despite of net increase of $50 million in accruals for our annual incentive plans. The $50 million change was driven by a reversal of the 2012 bonus accrual and a normal accrual in the current year for incentive compensation. SG&A cost were $3.49 million in the quarter an increase of $17 million compared to the third quarter of 2012.", "In the third quarter we saw improvements in bad debt, litigation settlements and professional fees which were offset by the compensation accruals that I mentioned earlier. Without those accruals, SG&A cost would have improved $33 million. On a year-to-date basis, SG&A costs were lower by $19 million despite an increase of $93 million in compensation plan accruals over 2012.", "Turning to cash flow, third quarter 2013 net cash provided by operating activities was $736 million. This is an increase of $162 million compared to the third quarter of 2012. The strong performance on a working capital yield and cost control were the primary contributors to the almost 30% increase in net cash provided by operating activities. Working capital improved during the quarter as we tightened up on our receivables and payables. This is particularly evident in our DSO, where DSO has improved for three consecutive quarters and improved more than two days when compared to the third quarter of 2012.", "Our capital expenditures for the third quarter were $323 million, which is $79 million lower than the third quarter of 2012. Through the first nine months of 2013, capital expenditures were $824 million. We still anticipate capital spending of between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion for the full year of 2013. We remain disciplined on ensuring that we spend capital on assets that fit within our long-term strategy and generate acceptable returns.", "Putting all of this together, our free cash flow for the quarter was $452 million, an increase of $272 million compared to the third quarter 2012. Free cash flow in the quarter was $413 million if you exclude divestiture proceeds. Year-to-date free cash flow was $1.15 billion as compared to $614 million for the first nine months of 2012, an improvement of $533 million. Excluding divestiture proceeds, year-to-date free cash flow was $1.03 billion. As David said, based on strong year-to-date free cash flow driven by yield, SG&A savings, working capital improvements and capital spending discipline, we are raising our 2013 free cash flow targets from between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion to between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion.", "We returned $171 million to our shareholders through our third quarter dividends and we invested $488 million in acquisitions primarily the acquisition of RCI in Montreal. Yield on our collection and disposal operations grew 2.3% in the third quarter. We believe that on average we need about 2% of yield to cover cost inflation. Over the last two years, our yield has not been enough to recover cost inflation. However, over the last three quarters, we have shown sequential growth in yield and in third quarter we fully offset the cost inflation in our business.", "Moving to volumes, internal volume growth was negative 0.6% in the quarter and negative 1.3% if you adjust for the one additional day in the current quarter. We saw overall collection volume decline by 2%, a modest deterioration from the second quarter level of negative 1.4%. More specifically, commercial volumes declined 3.1%, industrial volumes declined 2.2% and residential declined 1.4%. In the industrial line of business, we continue to see tough competition for both temporary and permanent roll-off work. For example, we have seen temporary roll-off volumes declined 3.1% while our rate per hall has increased by more than 5% we emphasized price over volume gains. We will continue our focus on improving yields and on pursuing higher margin roll-off business. This trade-off was very profitable for us in the third quarter as our industrial line of business achieved the highest income from operations and income from operations margins that we have seen.", "In the landfill line of business, volumes were positive 4.1%; MSW volumes grew by 4.3%; and C&D volume rose 9.3%. Combined special waste and revenue generating cover volume were positive 1.9%. That growth is a reflection of the growth we have seen in our energy services business. When you look at overall operating results, our income from operations margin increased 20 basis points to 16.8% when compared to the third quarter of 2012. As David mentioned, our traditional solid waste business collection, landfill and transfer stations had a very good quarter. Income from operations in those lines of business increased $71 million and income from operations margins increased 120 basis points. The collection lines of business drove most of the income from operations increase as all three lines of business increased when compared to the third quarter of 2012. These improvements were partially offset by a combined 70 basis point decline in our recycling and waste energy operations.", "In our waste energy business, average electricity pricing improved almost 3% in the third quarter when compared to the third quarter of 2012. The price improvement was offset by a lower volumes and an increase in repair and maintenance cost due to timing of plant turnarounds. Overall the waste energy business earnings per share were almost $0.01 lower than the third quarter of 2012 and we expect a similar headwind in the fourth quarter which is consistent with our annual guidance of negative $0.02 per share given at the beginning of the year. In recycling business we have seen increased cost related to Chinese Green Fence and from acquired operations. In addition to the structural, contract changes as David mentioned, we\u2019re also focused on operating cost improvement. We\u2019re looking at ways to reduce the 10% increase in operating cost at our cycling facilities. This will take some time but we have to decisive action to generate an appropriate return on our investments in recycling assets.", "Turning specifically to operating expenses, the acquired operations of RCI and Greenstar accounted for almost $60 million of our $97 million increase in operating expenses. The majority of the remaining increase related to other recycling cost, the timing of repair and maintenance at waste energy and the timing of repair and maintenance at waste energy facilities.", "Finally looking at other financial metrics at the end of the third quarter our weighted average cost of that 5.06% and our debt to total capital ratio was 58.9% consistent with our targeted ratio of 60%.", "The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 13% at the end of the quarter. Our disciplined approach to yield management, cost control and capital spending is working. Despite significant projected headwinds for the full year from our recycling operations the results of the first nine months of 2013 have put us in a position to achieve our exceed our yield, SG&A, earnings per share and free cash flow goals and we\u2019re not going to change our focus. We thank all of our employees who worked hard to achieve these excellent results.", "With that Jenisha let\u2019s open the line for questions.", "", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari of Credit Suisse.", "", "Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse", "The first question is just on you know how should investors think about your ability to buy back stock you know given higher free cash flow guidance, but also given some other moving parts like you know higher CapEx spend, you know next year you will have, you will presumably going to payout bonuses which aren\u2019t in cash flow this year but your cost control is better. So maybe help us think about the moving parts you know leverage on the balance sheet, how do we think about buy back here? You haven't been in the market for a while.", "", "David Steiner", "Couple of things here, first of all in 2014 we expect to allocate free cash flow to dividends as we always do about a 100 million to a 150 acquisitions and the remainder to go towards the combination of debt repayment and share repurchase and in fact we have proceeds from divestures and the proceeds from the exercise of stock options this year that we plan to use to buy back some shares in Q4. I will determine how much of that we will use once we see October free cash flow. When you think about what you talked about which was couple of the headwinds that we have on free cash flow, we have got you know the bonus payout, we have the expiration of bonus depreciation which will negatively impact us by that 230 million and on the other side we have the drivers of this year which we will expect to continue of course yield cost control capital discipline and working capital management. So and of course we intend to drive operating costs next year as well. I expect 2014 to be a solid year for us even with a little bit of headwind from those two items.", "", "Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse", "Okay and just on the recycling side could you give us the sense of you know the time frame and really negotiating these contracts. You know do you have to wait for these to expire, you said they were 3 to 5 years and does that Greenstar acquisition earlier this year, how does that mix differ from your legacy business and does that complicate the process further in terms of fixing the recycling business?", "", "David Steiner", "Yeah you know we do have to wait for those contracts to expire but even in our existing contracts you know we have got plenty of contracts right now that have contamination level clauses and so we need to go back and forth that\u2019s why we say, today we\u2019re having conversations with our customers about that and we\u2019re seeing some movement. We just can\u2019t see a movement across the 100% of the base. So it's going to take that three years as we see the contracts roll off. As far as the mix from Green Star, we inherited a couple of bad contracts in that deal, but as far as the mix no, it\u2019s not a dramatic mix different than our current recycling business.", "", "Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse", "Okay, great. And then lastly, could you remind us how much of your business now resets on CBI in Q3 traditionally? Thank you.", "", "David Steiner", "Well, about 40% of the entire business reset and that\u2019s generally about 50:50 between January 1 and July 30.", "", "Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot Dave.", "", "David Steiner", "Sure.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Corey Greendale of First Analysis.", "", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "Hey, good morning.", "", "David Steiner", "Good morning.", "", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "Couple of questions. So first of all, it sounds like underlying volume trend to a positive, but could you just speak to that a little bit more specifically given it sounds like you are pushing some volume all way because of the focus on yield. So just speak to broadly what you are seeing in the economy any reasonable variation what you are seeing in terms of that customer service levels any increases yet?", "", "David Steiner", "Yes, what we are seeing what I\u2019d call, I think you would characterize it correctly, I recall the volume environment very stable. On the industrial side, we aren\u2019t going to chase that low margin business, right. And so other folks are going to chase that low margin business, they are going to fill up their capacity and we are going to go on the other side, we are going to get yield on the industrial side rather than volume. So as we said that, that trade-off was pretty spectacular with margins on the industrial line moving up 130 basis points.", "The residential line, I would say, pricing and volumes are fairly stable, but there is always some interesting bidding on the residential side. And look I will tell you in the last few years, we probably had some interesting bids on the residential side. We have gotten much more disciplined on making sure that we don\u2019t go after residential business, which is generally low margin, low return on capital and high investment of capital. We are just not going to chase those kind of volumes unless we can get sufficient returns. And then I guess the one that\u2019s really popped up the most recently is on the recycling side. We recognized that we have to make a systemic change in the way we approach the market on recycling, so that we can get long-term stable earnings. And I talked about the four things we are going to do to change the way we approach the market, but you still see some folks that are out bidding large recycling contracts with just with a low processing fee or a simple split of the revenue. And my guess is that the market will adjust to these environments of high operating cost and low commodity prices. My guess is the market will adjust, but we can\u2019t control that. Also we can control is what we do and we are going to take a much more disciplined approach to the recycling market.", "", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "Okay. And actually following up on that point some of the changes that you are talking about, have you had any feedbacks from the market either from customers or from your people in the field on the receptivity to that kind of stuff? And then what\u2019s involved in managing some of these things like the auditing, the recycling stream, what\u2019s involved operationally in doing that and in terms of dealing with any customer complaints and people come back and say hey, I didn\u2019t actually have that much laugh in there or anything like that?", "", "David Steiner", "Well, these are mostly large municipal contracts when you are doing these audits. And so the \u2013 it\u2019s a real interesting situation that you got going on in the recycling markets. We have pushed and everybody has pushed single stream recycling throughout the United States. What we haven\u2019t pushed is educating the consumers as to what can go in there that can be recycled and what goes in that causes processing cost to go up. So we have to do a better job of educating what \u2013 and we can do that in conjunction with our municipal customers.", "As far as how are those conversations going? Look I \u2013 and I like in this to what happened in our company about 10 years ago when we put in a fuel surcharge, right. When we first put in the fuel surcharge on residential contracts, there was a lot of pushback from municipal customers. There were plenty of municipal customers that said we are not going to put a fuel surcharge in, because we have never done it before and we said fine, that\u2019s fine we are not going to bid those residential contracts. And over time as fuel became more important to everybody, the market basically reset and now you don\u2019t see contracts that are put out without a fuel surcharge. I would expect that same thing to happen in recycling. Look, the recycling business has not being economically viable for anyone over the last few years, we want to recycle as much as we can, we want to help our customers recycle but we obviously can\u2019t do that unless what we have is a long term sustainable business model and so we\u2019re going to reset our business practices to do that you know I would be surprised to see the market do the same.", "", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "Okay last quick one for me, I think David at the beginning of your comments you said something about your operating cost program accelerating in 2014, I was just hoping you might just elaborate on that what kind of cost savings you\u2019re talking about and where you might find those cost savings?", "", "Jim Trevathan", "We\u2019re doing very well with our collection business that we\u2019re focused on, the operating side. We\u2019re making real headway especially in some of our certified locations. We have touched about half of our areas to-date; we have got a couple of dozen sites that we have certified as meeting the goals. We\u2019re not ready yet until guidance next year to begin to talk about those dollars but we\u2019re excited about the opportunity Corey and see real improvement on the operating side both efficiency and cost per unit.", "", "David Steiner", "What Jim and his team have done on the operating cost side is you know nothing short of remarkable I mean, it really is a culture change in the way we treat both our efficiency and our service right? And it takes a long time to change that culture, so we have been doing this for a while we\u2019re going to continue to do it, it's going to be the way we do business forever and so we have full expect to see that continue to accelerate in 2014.", "", "Jim Trevathan", "Corey it's really is adding the technology that we put on trucks those on-board computers and added a real defined management process along with an accounting process to get the value out of the on-board computers and we have seen other industries do it, we are leaving hours and we will get it done over the next couple of years.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman of Wunderlich.", "", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "So on capital spending, can we talk about that from a philosophical standpoint because you clearly have this objecting of driving better returns and one of the three value drivers you got your hands around, you\u2019re driving better price the other is your cost side on margins but the third one is capital efficiency. So can you frame where your head is with regards to maintenance capital spending, how should we think about that as a percentage of the business. If your company is growing sort of organically 3% to 4%?", "", "Jim Fish", "First of all when you think about capital spending for the year, year-to-date we\u2019re about $476 million under the low end of our guidance for the year so we have got to spend 476 million for the fourth quarter, we have averaged about 400 million the last two years and we have also accelerated just recently some truck and some AT [ph] purchases and heavy equipment purchases in Q4. So we think we will be at or near the bottom end of that guidance range that we originally gave. With that said I think you know we think that 9% to 10% of revenue will be appropriate level of capital spend for waste management and we think we will finish the year within that range, basically the bottom-line here is that Jim and I have put some discipline into the process this year by trimming out some of the nice to have requests. We probably Jim approved 90% rest of the request that had come across our desk.", "", "David Steiner", "In the second half, Jim as we instituted the discipline in the first quarter.", "", "Jim Fish", "Yeah so I think this is really cutting out those request that we kind of categorize is nice to have and are approving all of the must have requests and Mike we have also kind of redefined what we consider to be maintenance capital versus growth capital, we used to think of a contract renewal where we had the business and the renewal required new trucks. We used to think of that as being growth capital and we agree to find that, that really isn't growth capital because it doesn\u2019t add any top line dollars. That\u2019s maintenance capital and has to pull out of that area vice president\u2019s leave [ph] plan.", "", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "Okay so if I\u2019m hearing this correctly we should see growth capital one come down proportionally but also there is maybe a new level where maintenance is even managed tighter and so while 9 to 10 in the aggregate maintenance is not 9 to 10 it's going to be less than that.", "", "David Steiner", "Yes so I\u2019m saying overall total capital is in the 10% range and I would say that on the growth capital side, we need to look just got the appropriate returns. We haven\u2019t turned it down. We have invested capital in our energy services business, which we considered to be a nice growth business. But I think you are right about maintenance capital where we are narrowing the definition of this and putting some discipline into the process.", "", "Jim Fish", "And by the way, Michael, when you grow revenue through yield, it takes absolutely zero capital.", "", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "Right, exactly. Okay. So for you David, on fees and surcharges, how much money are you leaving on the table by having rolled back or waived fees and surcharges? And where are you in bringing new discipline around that?", "", "David Steiner", "Yes. I mean, it\u2019s a significant dollar amount. When we look at all of our charges, if we were at a 100% compliant and obviously you never going to get to 100% compliant, but if we were at a 100% compliant that would be roughly $360 million. And so look, we aren\u2019t going to back down from our yield programs. What we are trying to do is drive a lot of different parts of the yield program, not just raising prices, but driving other pieces that can drive yield and either the nail on their head. One of our key focuses in 2014 will be driving environmental fee and fuel surcharge compliance up.", "", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "And that\u2019s \u2013 I mean, that\u2019s an existing, it\u2019s already in the invoice, so this isn\u2019t I am still going to see improving the reported to us, the reported yield should still continue to improve, because you have got a discipline there, but you also capture an incremental revenue dollar that was already in the invoice you have just rolled it back? Right, is that the right way to think about?", "", "David Steiner", "Yes. I mean, what\u2019s going on right now is that depending on the fee of the surcharge, only 55% to 75% of the customers actually even have the surcharge. And so just to give you an easy example, on the fuel environmental surcharge in the past, if a salesperson went out and waived the \u2013 either waived the fuel surcharge or the environmental surcharge for both of them, if they waived it for a customer, there was really no oversight about that. What we have done now is we put the rules in place that if you waive them, you\u2019ve got to get a higher level of approval and you can imagine just that focus on fuel and environmental raises the compliance rates. And so on new business, we are going to make sure that we get it more often. And on existing business, we are going to go back and in every case, where we can get it we are going to try to get it there. And then obviously, we have got other folks that aren\u2019t at full fuel at environmental, and that\u2019s what you are talking about. When they are not at full fuel at environmental we can raise up \u2013 we can raise them up to get them closer to or at the full fuel or environmental surcharge.", "", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "Okay. So now, I am hearing is two bites at that apple, which is even more interesting. So David, you kindly offered in the second quarter that free cash flow will be flat year-over-year. Having raised the guidance, will we still be flat in \u201814 and it sounded like Jim, you alluded to without saying it specifically in your opening comments that, that would in fact be the case. But I just want to get a feel for what a free cash \u2013 how we should think about \u201814\u2019s free cash?", "", "David Steiner", "Yes, I mean look Jim talked about it earlier that there is a lot of ins and outs in \u201814 with bonus depreciation with the cash going out from the compensation accruals that we are having this year, the movement of working capital, but what we have always said that this company is first and foremost a free cash flow generating machine. Our guidance this year was $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. We have now raised that to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. And Michael, you and I have had this conversation many times. I have always said this company had a very minimum every year it should generate $1.2 billion in free cash flow (indiscernible) and but the \u2013 with the focus that Jim and Jim have put on capital, I am very confident that we can do that not jut in 2014 but going forward.", "", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "Okay. And then question for you, as there is lots of success, landfill price seems to be more muted, what can be different in \u201814 put out the depth in which you can \u2013 breadth of which you can raise landfill price?", "", "David Steiner", "Right. I mean, there are two things one is the contractual nature, right, I mean, those are different types of contracts longer term contracts, but two is just the visibility. Just this year, we have started to get reports on sort of the top 10 customers at every landfill we will get every quarter, we will get what the price action has been with those top 10, top 20 type customers. So look pricing is all about discipline and accountability and you can\u2019t have accountability without visibility. So you know it's the same approach we\u2019ve taken whether it's pricing or cost, we have said you know what we are going to get the visibility so that we can hold people accountable and once you hold people accountable it's amazing what this organization does. I mean this is an execution organization and once we set the right direction they will execute and we\u2019re holding our field managers accountable and they are holding both accountable down the line it's truly amazing what this organization can accomplish.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey of Goldman Sachs.", "", "Usha Gunthapally - Goldman Sachs", "This is Usha Gunthapally on behalf of Alex, how are you?", "", "David Steiner", "Good morning. Doing well.", "", "Usha Gunthapally - Goldman Sachs", "Any updated thoughts on the divestment pipeline for 2013 and any potential for 2014?", "", "David Steiner", "Can you repeat the question for me?", "", "Usha Gunthapally - Goldman Sachs", "What is your divestment pipeline look like for 2013 and anything going at a 2014?", "", "David Steiner", "So this year we have divested somewhere in the neighborhood of a $100 million and that\u2019s probably about where we typically are through the year so I wouldn\u2019t expect it to differ dramatically in 2014.", "", "Usha Gunthapally - Goldman Sachs", "And was there any noticeable change in construction related volumes in third quarter and any early read on the fourth quarter trends?", "", "David Steiner", "Yeah you know I think like we said earlier I think that we can certainly say that the volume trend for us is very stable, you know when we look at the construction related volumes we have got very good volumes at our landfill which is very high margin. You know we don\u2019t have as a good volume and industrial line; it's what we\u2019re talking about earlier. We basically intentionally share some low margin industrial business and we\u2019re not going out and chasing new industrial business at low margins. You know we have got the highest new business rate that we have had in the industrial line probably since I\u2019ve been here. So we aren\u2019t chasing collection [ph] volumes on the construction side. The good news is and we\u2019re not chasing those at low margins. If we can get the right margins we will chase them but we\u2019re not chasing them at low margins, the good news is we\u2019re still seeing that volume come into our landfills at very high margins. So I would say that we have seen a nice uptick on the construction side for us, it manifest itself more at the landfill you know last year we had some industrial volumes from Sandy that obviously won't repeat in the fourth quarter but other than that we see the volumes on the construction side being pretty robust.", "", "Usha Gunthapally - Goldman Sachs", "That\u2019s helpful and obviously you\u2019re focused on pricing growth but in the medium term what\u2019s the upside do you see from changing your recycling contract structure and surcharges?", "", "David Steiner", "Yeah you know that\u2019s like I said there is no quick and easy fix on the recycling front. You know that\u2019s going to take some time, you know we have got some plans in place to see improvement but frankly it's modest improvement in the near term. You know in the medium term you know I would like to sort to see how the program plays out a little bit before we make a call and what we\u2019re going to see in the medium term but you know look this is again this is no different than what we did with the fuel surcharge 10 years ago. We sort of led the industry and it became an industry standard, look if customers want to have recycling for the long term which is look that\u2019s what all of our goal is to have recycling for the long term. We all need to make it a more stable and profitable business and that\u2019s what our program is designed to do.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk of Wedbush Securities.", "", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "Just wanted a follow-up on this recycling concern or issue and David you touched a little bit upon on it, but to me if you\u2019re calling yourself the leader why wouldn\u2019t we start to think about doing something more of the largest scale or more I say inflection point and how the business is being grown and that is have you looked at third party processing our outsourcing of this, is this something you can get an economic value on doing some of the things you\u2019re talking about doing and can you do it sooner versus later because back in the 90s or maybe in earlier than that, recycling was a bus for lot of companies with commodity prices down, it doesn\u2019t seem to be generating the cost of capital returns that you would like? And pricing is something that you are never going to control, so to me as I look at this business, are we going to continue to have headwinds on this relative to your ability to drive returns in other areas?", "", "David Steiner", "Right. Look, short-term, I think you are absolutely right. We are looking at everything we can look at short-term to improve the business. So for example, we shut down two recycling facilities and we moved up volume to third-party processors. So what you see in recycling is basically same thing you see in the solid waste which is innovating market by market analysis. So in California where you are supported by fees to support recycling, we have never really seen profitability win. And so I think you are absolutely right, Al, in the short-term we can do some things to change that. But in the long-term we need to make the entire business more profitable and more stable. And I think the four actions we talked about will do just that.", "", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "How many facilities do you have that are recycling oriented?", "", "David Steiner", "Yes, we have got about 120 total, about 40ish, 35, 40 single street.", "", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "Okay. I may have misplaced my second question here, but\u2026", "", "David Steiner", "So Al, while you are looking for your second question, I think it\u2019s important to say that the recycling business is difficult as it been for us over the last two years. Recycling, it\u2019s imperative that we would be in this business for our customer needs. Customers require it, we need to provide it. We just have to improve the business at this point and that\u2019s why we are taking \u2013 tackling these issues as David went through.", "", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "Yes, but I think I agree with 100% with that, but my concern is that at the end of the day, it appears not only for you, but for the industry that this is almost a lost leader in the short-term, because you are of the education process and change in habits that needs to take place to drive better than corporate average return on the business, but\u2026.", "", "David Steiner", "Yes, but again, Al, I go back to the \u2013 I go back to the fuel surcharge on the residential contract that occurred probably 10 years ago. At that point in time, our residential business was low single-digit margins and now what you see is sort of mid-teen type margin. So a lot of that is driven by the fact that what used to happen as you would enter into a long-term contract, fuel would go up, so your cost structure went up and before you knew it, you are losing money on a residential contract that when you are originally fitted, you made some money on and then if the municipality had a five-year renewal, they would renew it for five years and you continue to lose money on it. And so basically what we did is we said look we have got to find out what are the drivers of profitability in the residential line of business and how do we fix this from our point of view so that we don\u2019t get stuck in this constant low single-digit margin business.", "Recycling is in the exact same spot here. Jim is absolutely right. We have got to meet our customer demands and we fully expect to meet our customer demands, but our customers need to realize that if they want us to meet their demands long-term, we need to make it a more viable business and we need to do that by ensuring that when times are good everybody is happy right. When times are good, we are having a revenue split with our customer. They are making money. We are making money. The problem is when commodity prices go down and processing costs go up, our customers don\u2019t lose money, we lose money on the recycling side. So we just need to make them understand that in order to make this business work long-term, we have to make some structural changes. And I would expect that over time, you will see exactly that happened and what you will find is that we are certainly the leader in recycling. I would like to be the leader in a business that has projectable solid returns.", "", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "I agree. I think sometimes it\u2019s also a constructive and healthy to fire clients so our customers. My second question is that and I am trying to appreciate obviously the comments have been focused around pricing. You can only continue to get pricing when you see the volume trend being positive as well so \u2013 or we had a spot here where you are going to be offsetting top line maybe a net positive because of the pricing but at some point your customer they start to push back on little bit more aggressive pricing in the marketplace.", "", "David Steiner", "Well look you know we certainly haven't seen that point but obviously pricing gets better as volumes get better. You know we have got a good I would characterize the volume environment right now as very stable but it's not growing like it did in the \u201905 to \u201907 time frame. I think if we continue to see housing starts above a 1 million, you will also see new starts pick up because you have to build new businesses around those new subdivisions and you know we expect the volume trends to not get dramatically better but we certainly don\u2019t expect them to get dramatically worse. What we found is that since I\u2019ve been CEO now for 10 years what we found is that our churn rate doesn\u2019t change dramatically regardless of the level of pricing program that we have put in place and so you know I think there is still a lot of runway to go from a pricing point of view but you\u2019re absolutely right I will much prefer to see a robust volume environment that would certainly help both from a leveraging volume point of view and from a price point of view.", "", "Jim Fish", "One quick thing here when you think about volume one sure way for us to create shareholder value and really what is a mature industry here is to price increase. Now if we\u2019re going to make collection price increasing or increases sustainable we got to get price increases on the disposal side and I think Michael asked me question earlier about that but that is going to be important for us in 2014 is to make sure that we\u2019re mirroring the success we\u2019re having on a collection side of pricing with success on the disposal side and if we do and we think that that\u2019s a long term sustainable model for growing shareholder value.", "", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "And finally the volume decline it was more noticeable or meaningful on the industrial side and going over the next near term should we still expect, so we think about volumes comp in negative or are we back to flat line here?", "", "David Steiner", "On the adjusted and industrial line you mean?", "", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "Well I\u2019m trying to appreciate. I think heard volumes were while you reported down 0.6 and down 1.3 day adjusted. I thought I heard industrial was where you were pushing some volumes away maybe that was a major component to the decline, going forward do you still have a few quarters where you\u2019re sort of pruning the volume based and therefore we should expect the negative volume comp near term?", "", "David Steiner", "I wouldn\u2019t be surprised by that, you know it's not just that we\u2019re pruning unprofitable business, we also are chasing the low margin roll off business, you know like I said if you give me the option of getting negative on a work day adjusted basis the industrial volumes were negative 2.2%. If we can get 5.5% yield and 8.4% core price I will take that trade off every day and so what\u2019s really going on here is that we\u2019re shedding some volumes intentionally but we\u2019re also not just taking our chance and throwing them out on the street you know when as other folks throw their chance out on the street and their capacity gets maximized we\u2019re then able to go in and get selective hauls at higher prices which you know for us is a spectacular trade-off. Like we said this is the highest income from operations we\u2019ve had in our industrial line since I\u2019ve been here and that\u2019s with the 2.2% volume decrease. So the price volume trade-off for us is working very well and we don\u2019t anticipate change in that.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Box of KeyBanc Capital.", "", "Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Question on your SG&A savings program, now that you guys are about a year in and it looks like waste fundamentals are starting to turn. Can you just maybe give us a sense of the type of leverage that you\u2019re thinking we can get on SG&A as volumes do come back and ultimately do you think that the 100 basis points of expansion from 2012 levels are still generally doable?", "", "Jim Fish", "Yes so what I would say on SG&A is that that\u2019s you know the comps get more difficult but what we have said to the field for 2014 is that\u2019s not only where we are going to be flat from \u201812 to \u201913 in absolute dollars, but we said we are going to be flat from \u201813 to \u201814. And we are in the process of going through budget reviews right now. It\u2019s as you can imagine. That\u2019s a difficult message for not only to feel, but for corporate to hear, but we think that it\u2019s achievable. At some point, obviously as your business grows, you are not able to hold flat in absolute dollar terms, but we do think over this three-year period we can hold flat on SG&A and work our way through the increases, the headwinds that we face each year from conversation.", "", "David Steiner", "By the way, SG&A as Jim exactly like what I said about capital before if you add yields you don\u2019t have to add SG&A. If you add volume you do.", "", "Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "And that\u2019s really helpful. And I guess, Jim, just to be clear, if you hold SG&A flat, does that include the acquisitions or is that excluding the acquisitions that you have done?", "", "Jim Fish", "Well, it\u2019s a good question. We have basically held it flat, including the acquisitions this year, which has been quite a task, but we expect as we said at the beginning of the year, we said we would hold flat. We are on track at this point to hold flat. We will run a little negative in the fourth quarter. We have got about $26 million worth of comp related headwinds in Q4. As I mentioned, we had about $50 million in Q3, but we still think even with $26 million in comp related headwinds, we will finish at or below last year\u2019s levels.", "", "Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Perfect, that\u2019s helpful. And then just a question on the industrial roll-off side, clearly you guys are taking more disciplined approach there, can you just give us a sense of one, where utilization is at for these assets? And two, I mean, if you \u2013 what is your view on the pricing market going forward, does it ever improve to the point where it actually makes sense to put these assets back to work?", "", "David Steiner", "Yes. So I can\u2019t give you an exact utilization number, but I will tell you we just went through our business reviews with our market areas two weeks ago. And you told here anyone that says that they are missing volumes, because they don\u2019t have equipment right. And so I would characterize the market as fairly tight from an equipment point of view and look that bodes well. I think that bodes very well for us both from a volume and from a pricing point of views, but like I said before, we expect to see some stability there. I would not be surprised if we see housing starts continue at over million starts that we see both price and volume on the industrial side, but we will wait to see it before we declare victory.", "", "Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Perfect thanks guys.", "", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer of BB&T.", "", "Adam Thalhimer - BB&T", "Hey good morning guys. I would also say congratulations on a nice quarter.", "", "David Steiner", "Thank you, Adam.", "", "Adam Thalhimer - BB&T", "David, as it relates to pricing, I don\u2019t hear you saying a lot, hey, we are going out there and we are pushing price, I hear you are talking about a mix issue, you are not going out and chasing low margin work, I hear you are talking about surcharges, but I mean, the works I know you are actively out there pushing price?", "", "David Steiner", "Yes. Well, look our core price was the highest again that we have seen in a long time, but I think it\u2019s a great point. Look, well, we have been our first cut of our pricing programs in sort of the 2004 to 2008 timeframe. The primary weapon that we had were price increases. We are a much more sophisticated pricing company at this point in time and we look at a number of different areas. One of the areas where we end up giving away dollars is on new business pricing versus lost business pricing and then lost business versus new business right, you lose business at a high margin and if you gain business at a low margin, you are going to lose EBIT dollars. And so we sort of changed the way that we look at pricing from quite frankly, we don\u2019t look at yield. I mean, obviously yield is an indicator, but what we look at is total dollars dropped to the bottom line from all the actions we take on pricing whether it\u2019s core price or which includes the fees and surcharges rollbacks, new business pricing, lost business pricing. We take a look at all of it to understand the bottom line effect of our pricing program. So getting the 2.3% yield and dropping to zero dollars to the bottom line is not what we are looking to do. We are looking to see yield go up only as an indicator of dropping more dollars to the bottom line. And so the short answer to your question is I think you are being very perceptive which is you know this is much more than just core price increases it's about pulling a lot of different levers in pricing and dropping dollars to the bottom line not just a reported number.", "", "Adam Thalhimer - BB&T", "Okay and then I guess the question there really is can you get more aggressive as the volume recovery plays out?", "", "David Steiner", "I don\u2019t think there is any doubt but again we can get more aggressive both on you know if you will net price increases but that means we can also get more aggressive on roll-backs that means we can also get more aggressive on new business pricing so there is a lot of ways you can drop dollars to the bottom line over and above just raising prices on current customers.", "", "Jim Fish", "It's really important that we address it on the disposal side too. So in order for us to continue down this path of success on collection pricing we have to be equally successful on the disposal side.", "", "Adam Thalhimer - BB&T", "And Jim is that harder or how would you characterize that versus the collections side?", "", "Jim Fish", "Yeah I think it is harder because typically you have fewer customers they are bigger customers, so there is you know little more perceived risk in the managers mind there but you know so increasing a small you know restaurant has relatively low risk to an area of Vice President versus a big disposal customer. So yeah it is probably more difficult but I think it's equally critical.", "", "Adam Thalhimer - BB&T", "Okay and then just in terms of industry volumes what\u2019s your sense of the having been in this industry for decade, what is your sense of the environment out there? What you\u2019re seeing how sustainable it is et cetera.", "", "Jim Fish", "Yeah I would say that it's again I would say it's look we\u2019re not seeing dramatic volume growth but what we\u2019re seeing is good steady volume growth and you know we\u2019re seeing, you know where we\u2019re seeing the best volume growth frankly is at our landfill which obviously is our highest margin business so that\u2019s a good thing but you know again when you look at it from our point of view the industry volumes I would say right now are doing more to support our pricing programs than providing volume leverage obviously at negative 1.3% volume we\u2019re not providing a lot of volume leverage but what it's doing is it's filling up capacity for the rest of the industry at lower margins and we\u2019re able to that\u2019s able to support our pricing program.", "So you know we\u2019re not going to go after I think the industry is actually growing volumes faster than we\u2019re and by the way we\u2019re perfectly comfortable with that because you know if the industry wants to chase there is always going to be someone that\u2019s going to chase those low margin volumes and as long as they fill up their capacity chasing those low margin volumes we can take the higher margin volumes and when they collect it they are still going to show up with at our landfills.", "", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Barbara Noverini of Morningstar.", "", "Barbara Noverini \u2013 Morningstar", "So should we expect increase investment in your existing recycling plants in order to more efficiently handle contamination for example can increased automation make it (indiscernible) and processing cost at this stage and if not what more can you do to reduce operational cost as you work on educating your customers and improving those contract term?", "", "David Steiner", "Yeah you know they really isn't a lot that we can do from a technology point of view to make the processing easier and so you can\u2019t really do it inside the plant you really have to do it outside the plant with the materials right and so you know we have got plenty of contracts that have maximum contamination levels call it at 10% and when recycling prices are high and everybody is making money you don\u2019t go in and audit it and go back to your customer but once you start to realize that you\u2019re getting 20% to 30% contamination and your processing cost goes up and the commodity prices go down and you start losing money that\u2019s when you need to say look we need to go back in where we have these clauses in the contracts, we need to go back in with the customers and say we need to do a better job of helping you get these contamination rates down but in the meantime we need to either charge a higher processing fee or reduce the rebate to cover our increased processing cost.", "", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar", "What\u2019s involved in that auditing cost? As I assume that happens at the recycling plant as the waste arrives, how do you go about providing that?", "", "David Steiner", "Yes you do it as the waste arrives and you go through sample loads.", "", "Jim Fish", "Barbara, I was also going to mention that there are specific things we can do in addition to the structural changes that Dave mentioned. We are \u2013 this business has grown fairly dramatically in the number of recycling facilities over the last handful of years and it probably has exceeded the experienced base of managers that have manufacturing like experience we are moving people around they have had a great experience and they have managed cost to locations that have the largest need and we are having real success there. You will see that little by little as we drive down that 10% increase we have seen in the operating cost per ton we will start cutting into that in Q4 and especially into next year.", "", "David Steiner", "Barbara, I guess, when I look at the recycling business what happened someone referred to it earlier on one of the prior questions what you have had in the past, there are some dramatic price dips on the commodity. So back in the 90s, you had it and then back in the great recession you had it, but those were always V-shaped drops in price right. They dropped dramatically and fast, but then they came back dramatically in past. So you said okay, well we can live with a little volatility now and then. But what you have seen lately is a more sustained period of low commodity prices, but so we looked at it with low commodity prices in 2009-2010, we said okay with low commodity prices, let\u2019s do something to fix that and we put in floors and different things like that, not thinking that our processing cost could go up because of regulations imposed by China, so the cost go up from the regulations in China and we address that. And what I am saying is we can fix some of that short-term, just like we fixed the pricing or the low commodity price short-term, we can take some actions to fix it short-term, but what we need to do is fix it long-term, because if we don\u2019t fix it long-term, what you are going to see is that there is not going to be recycling facilities anymore, because look we want to help our customers, but we also want to do it by earning a decent return on the capital that we have got invested in this business. So we need to make some systemic changes so that we can both continue to recycle, but then also recycle even more for our customers.", "", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar", "Yes, it\u2019s great to see you digging into those issues. And just on the Chinese restrictions, have you seen any of that becoming less stringent, I noticed there is supposed to be a temporary measure, but do have any indication that it\u2019s going to lift anytime soon?", "", "David Steiner", "Yes, they recently extended it into 2014. I would say that in certain locations, you have seen a little bit of easing, but certainly not enough to make a dramatic difference.", "", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar", "Got it.

Looking at 2013, we built strong momentum in the first three quarters of the year. And that momentum continued into the fourth quarter with our traditional solid waste business growing margins by 150 basis points. However, quarterly EPS results, particularly fourth quarter EPS results can be impacted by accruals sometimes positive and sometimes negative.", "In the fourth quarter of 2013 we had $0.11 more expense from accruals than in 2012. $0.02, of that $0.11 was offset by tax benefits, so we had a net of $0.09 more from these type of accruals per share than we had in 2012. This $0.09 consists of $0.06 from incentive compensation and $0.03 from risk management.", "Without these accruals, our earnings would have continued to show a strong year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. So our traditional solid waste business is strong and our earnings momentum continues. Indeed, we have seen that momentum extended to January as preliminary results show income from operations improving 12% and income from operations margin expanding about 110 basis points when compared to January of 2013.", "Looking at the full-year, we had a very successful 2013 as we met all the goals that we set out to accomplish. Our plan to increase yield, better managed costs, and have disciplined capital spending paid off in 2013 and should lead us to continued success in 2014.", "In 2013 we achieved full-year earnings per share of $2.15 and free cash flow of $1.32 billion, all despite $0.10 of unanticipated headwinds from our recycling business. In 2013 we expected yields to be between 1% and 1.5% and we exceeded that target.", "For the full-year our collection and disposal yield was 2.1% with each quarter sequentially higher than the previous one, culminating with the fourth quarter at the highest level for the year at 2.4%. Each of our lines of business had positive yield for the full-year with the exception of landfill C&D, which was impacted by Superstorm Sandy last year, core price increased to 3.8% in 2013, an improvement of 90 basis points and average landfill rate per unit for MSW ended the year with the highest rate that we've seen, increasing about 3.5% compared to 2012. This was a tremendous accomplishment by our team and they have plans in place to continue to have success in 2014. We expect that internal revenue growth from yields should be approximately 2% for 2014.", "As we said before, we need to get about 2% yields to offset cost inflation and grow margins. We did that in 2013 and we expect to do so again in 2014. In the fourth quarter, about a third of our volume decrease resulted from the year-over-year effect of volumes from Superstorm Sandy. We also launched national account business that we were not willing to keep at low rates.", "Looking at 2014 total volumes, we expect internal revenue growth in volume for 2014 to be very similar to 2013, about 1% negative. We'll see lower national account volumes in 2014 as we drive pricing at our low margin customers. We need to be more aggressive on those specific national accounts where we're providing platinum service at bronze pricing. The winter weather is definitely having a negative impact on volumes in the first quarter but we expect our normal seasonal upturn to occur as winter has receded.", "So, when we look at volumes we're more focused on getting the right volumes not the most volumes. We're looking for the best mix of yield and volumes to drive income from operating margins and dollars. And in our industry that mix always favors yields. Jim will give you the numbers but despite negative volumes, we increased income from operations dollars and margins in every collection line, which demonstrates the importance of yield.", "Turning to landfill volumes, all categories of our landfill volumes were positive for the full year and we expect that to continue into 2014. This strong demand should allow us to continue to see better pricing at our landfill. So once again, our traditional solid waste business performed very well in 2013 with strong margin improvement in all three of our collection and landfill lines of business.", "Our income from operations margins grew 90 basis points and operating EBITDA margins grew by 80 basis points in the traditional solid waste business. In 2014 we expect to grow earnings and margins in our traditional business through pricing, cost controls and increased deployment of our productivity initiatives.", "On the recycling front, we had a $0.12 decline year-over-year in earnings per share compared to the $0.02 decline that we anticipated at the beginning of 2013. As we outlined on our third quarter conference call, we're taking steps to improve the profitability of our recycling business. When contracts come up for renewal, we plan to increase processing fees, include tighter contamination limits with provisions that allow us to audit the inbound material, add language that allows us to recover increased costs due to unforeseen events and increased consumer education through our Recycle Often, Recycle Right program.", "These initiatives are starting to work. We've audited virtually all of our municipal contracts and have found numerous opportunities to charge customers for exceeding contractual contamination limits, and we've seen revenue as a percentage of tons sold decrease for three consecutive months. But even with these improvements, we want to be cautious in predicting recycling results in 2014 and we're assuming that operational savings will be offset by slight commodity price decline such that we expect to have no year-over-year EPS impact from our recycling line of business.", "Turning to our waste energy business, in 2013 our operations were essentially flat when compared to 2012. With long-term natural gas and electricity prices projecting to remain low, the outlook for growth in our waste energy business is limited. This as well as lower disposal tip fees and volumes resulting from contract transition are the primary reasons why we had to record a non-cash write-off of a significant portion of the goodwill of our waste energy business. But the charges are the result of projected long-term cash flows not short-term issues. So for 2014 we expect income from operations to be flat when compared to 2013 from our waste to energy operations.", "Turning to free cash flow, our disciplined approach to managing expenses and capital spending in 2013 allowed us to generate $1.32 billion of free cash flow, an increase of almost 60% compared to 2012. Excluding divestitures, free cash flow grew 51% when compared to 2012 to $1.180 billion.", "In the fourth quarter, we prepaid $51 million of crude expenses to help offset some cash flow headwind in 2014. Excluding that payment our 2013 free cash flow without divestitures would have been $1.24 billion well within our range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion.", "In 2014 we expect that free cash flow will be very similar to 2013. That's over $1.3 billion. We should achieve this despite anticipated headwinds of approximately $125 million from the expiration of bonus depreciation and the payment of incentive compensation. We should be able to overcome these headwinds through a combination of increased earnings, improvement in working capital and capital spending discipline.", "The strong free cash flow that we generated in 2013 allowed us to return over $900 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This is the highest amount of cash returned since 2011. For 2014, we anticipate continuing to grow the amount that we returned to shareholders.", "So, in summary, when we look back at 2013, we built a strong foundation with our pricing and cost control program. The momentum from these programs gives us the confidence that we can achieve our full year goal of adjusted EPS between $2.30 and $2.35 per fully diluted share and free cash flow of greater than $1.3 billion.", "I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our fourth quarter results and our 2014 outlook in more detail.", "Jim Fish", "Thank you, David. I'm going to review the results of the fourth quarter and expectations for 2014. I will start by discussing our SG&A costs and cash flow performance, then I'll expand on David's comments about the results of operations, yield and volume in our various lines of business. I'll conclude with a discussion of our financial metrics.", "Results for SG&A were better than we projected at the beginning of the year. We anticipate costs being flat when compared to 2012 and for SG&A costs as a percent of revenues improved 10 basis points. I'm pleased with the overall results of SG&A costs for the year improved $4 million to $1.47 billion and improved as a percent of revenue by 30 basis points to 10.5%.", "For the fourth quarter, SG&A costs were $376 million, an increase of $20 million. As a percent of revenue, SG&A costs rose to 10.7%. Both increases are a result of the accruals that David mentioned. This will not be our 2014 run rate as we expect that SG&A dollars will remain flat in 2014 and that SG&A as a percent of revenue will improve from 2013. We saw that in January that SG&A improved $8 million as compared to January 2013.", "Turning to cash flow, for the full year we generated $1.32 billion of free cash flow, an increase of almost $500 million when compared to 2012. We accomplished this in part by growth our net cash provided by operating activities, $160 million to $2.46 billion and by maintaining discipline on capital spending. Our capital expenditures for the year were $1.27 billion. If you exclude divestitures, free cash flow for the year grew nearly $400 million to $1.18 billion. Without the prepayment that David mentioned, free cash flow would have been $1.24 billion.", "In the fourth quarter we returned $410 million to our shareholders through a combination of $171 million for our dividends and $239 million in share repurchases. We also invested $26 million in tuck-in acquisitions in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2013, we returned $922 million to our shareholders consisting of $683 million in dividends and share repurchases of $239 million. Our Board has indicated its intention to increase the dividend in 2014 by 2.7% to $1.50 per share on an annual basis which would result in a dividend yield of approximately 3.4%. This is the 11th consecutive year of increasing the dividend.", "For 2014, the anticipated annual dividends equate to $700 million to be returned to our shareholders. We also have authorization from our Board of Directors to repurchase $600 million of our shares. During 2014 we expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion which is between 8.3% and 9% of revenue and free cash flow in 2014 is expected to be in excess of $1.3 billion, assuming a $100 million of divestitures and despite a $125 million of headwind that David mentioned. For 2014 we expect to spend between $100 million and $250 million on solid waste tuck-in acquisitions.", "I will now review internal revenue growth components and operating results. In the waste industry if we lower price, there is no new volume. Putting garbage on sale does not incentivize customers to create more garbage. If we were in an industry that could create incremental volume by lowering price like the consumer products industry, we might look at yield and volume mix differently, but in our industry we can't do that.", "When we look at the trade-off between yield and volume; we look at them together to determine the best mix in order to maximize income from operations, dollars and margins. This strategy worked in the fourth quarter and for the full-year in every line of business where we increased income from operations, dollars and margins despite negative volumes. So for example in the fourth quarter, commercial yield was 4.9%, which is the highest yield since the second quarter of 2008 and volumes declined 5% with this yield and volume trade-off income from operations grew $21 million and margin grew 200 basis points. For the full-year commercial yield grew 3.3% and volumes declined 3.4%. But despite the volume loss, income from operations grew $42 million and margin expanded 70 basis points.", "For industrial, fourth quarter yield were 4.3% and volumes declined 3.7% and still income from operations grew $50 million and margin expanded 230 basis points. For the full-year, industrial yield grew 4.5% and volumes declined 1.9%. Despite the volume loss, income from operations grew $48 million and margin expanded 140 basis points.", "Similarly, the residential line of business also grew despite contractual restrictions on raising prices. In the fourth quarter, yield for the residential line of business grew 1.7% and volumes declined 2.9%, which resulted in income from operations growing $4 million and margin expanding 60 basis points.", "For the full-year residential yield grew 1.8% and volumes declined 1.7% which resulted in income from operations increasing $14 million and margins expanding 40 basis points. So as you can see the price and volume trade-off worked in all lines of our collection business, the income from operations trend improved in the fourth quarter and we expect this trend to continue into 2014.", "I will now review the landfill line of business for the fourth quarter where we saw the benefits of positive volume and positive yield. Volumes were positive 5.6% after adjusting for Sandy volumes. MSW yield was 1.7% with revenue per unit increasing 3.5%. Sandy adjusted MSW volumes grew by 1.6% and C&D volume rose 6.6%. Combined special waste and revenue generating cover volumes were positive 3.9%. Income from operations grew $25 million and margin grew 250 basis points. Our overall internal volume growth was negative 2.2% in the quarter and negative 1.5% if you adjust for the Sandy storm volumes.", "I will now discuss operating costs. Operating costs increased by $43 million in the fourth quarter, 64.8% of revenue which was flat with the fourth quarter of 2012. For the full-year operating costs increased $233 million to 65.2% of revenues compared to 65.1% in 2012. In both the fourth quarter and the full-year, the majority of the increases were for costs associated with recently acquired businesses and labor increases.", "Finally, looking at our other financial metrics, at the end of the fourth quarter our weighted average cost for debt was 4.97% and our debt to total capital ratio was 63%. The increase in this ratio from 58.9% in the third quarter is primarily the result of the impairment charges. Floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 15% at the end of the quarter. Our current income tax rate was 34.6% for both fourth quarter and the full-year. For 2014 we expect our tax rate to be approximately 35%.", "One last item that I would like to address is our asset impairments and unusual items. These non-cash charges are primarily related to goodwill associated with our waste energy business and other post-collection assets and related goodwill. David mentioned the impairment of historical goodwill in our waste energy business. The second category relates to asset impairments from our asset rationalization program.", "As we\u2019ve discussed, we\u2019ve been reviewing our post-collection assets to determine where we have cash flow negative or poor performing assets that do not fit into our strategic plan. Impairment of assets in the fourth quarter resulted from our analysis and led to our decision to mothball certain post-collection facilities. This concludes deferring active pursuit of expansion permits at four landfills.", "In our review we determined that we\u2019re able to move volumes to other waste management facilities without materially impacting customers or operations. Of course the volumes available to the mothballed facilities increase in the future; we can re-activate expansion permitting efforts or operations at those facilities.", "I would be remiss if I did not close by thanking all of our employees. They made 2013 as successful as it was and we appreciate their hard work. With that, Jenisha, let\u2019s open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari of Credit Suisse.", "Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse", "Good morning. Thank you. Just a question on volume, if we adjust for the low margin national account business that you\u2019re walking away from and maybe some weather impact, could you maybe comment on what the underlying volume growth is for 2014 that you\u2019re guiding through and also maybe comment on how you balance volume loss with negative operating density?", "Jim Fish", "Yes, when we look at 2014, it\u2019s probably about 60% to 65% of the volume loss. In 2014 it\u2019s going to be from national accounts and as you know that\u2019s generally very low margin business. We just recently lost our largest national account, which was low single-digit margin because we didn\u2019t want to reduce or stay flat on the price. We wanted to get a price increase because our margin was low single-digit and so we knew that was coming and it was the right business decision to make. The other -- sot that\u2019s going to account for roughly 50% or two-thirds of the volume loss in 2014, but the remainder -- we have the first quarter is going to have a tough Sandy comp still from Superstorm Sandy and obviously we had bad weather, so you\u2019ve got a little bit of an effect there. And then we still expect that our pricing program is going to drive out a bit of our commercial volume. So most of what you see in 2014 is culling out that low margin business then the year-over-year comps in the first quarter. As far as the density goes -- look that's a fundamental premise of this business that if you can create route density, obviously you can service the customer at a much lower cost. But we can\u2019t let that benefit that we get upset our pricing program, right. We got to be the pricing leader and if we aren\u2019t then no one else is going to do it. So we\u2019re going to be the pricing leader. We recognize that you get benefits from density. We certainly are looking to grow our commercial volume, but we will not grow our commercial volume at the -- we won't grow our commercial volume at the expense of price.", "Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse", "Very helpful. And a question on SG&A, if we assume that bonuses continue into the future, how should we think about SG&A going forward? Is it fair to say that it should run up to 10.5%, 11% on a normalized basis if we assume that management continues to get bonuses?", "Jim Fish", "Hamzah, on SG&A look, I think I was pretty pleased with how we turned out in 2013. We were actually specifically flat; we were actually down a little bit about $4 million. And we\u2019ve guided to flat in dollars in 2014, so when you think about it on a percentage basis, look as top line increases we expect that percentage will start to get down to the 10% and potentially below 10% range. To really be in the low nines, I think you\u2019re going to need to see a pretty robust rebound in the overall economy. I mean that\u2019s for us that has to be the big driver of top line growth -- the pricing strategy is clearly the right strategy as you heard from my numbers, but in order to get revenue to really take off, it\u2019s got to be from robust economic growth we can't afford that price volume tradeoff in the wrong direction. So, when we think about SG&A as a percent of revenue, I would expect that the flat SG&A will produce \u2013 obviously it's going to produce a lower percentage because of some increase in top line. We're going to get down to \u2013 not going to get down to 9% until we really see the overall economy take off but I'll tell you, there is still room for dollars on SG&A both on the labor and the non-labor front. We're not giving any guidance for 2015 but I would expect they'll hear the same message when we talk next year of being flat year-over-year.", "Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse", "Great. Just last question, I'll turn it over. Any update on the divestitures. It seems like you had some this quarter. How should we think about where you are and what process? Thank you.", "David Steiner", "Yes. When we look at the divestitures, as we said, we're looking \u2013 we're assuming $100 million of divestitures during the year. We've got a few in the pipeline particularly in the non-core business. We looked at our Chinese joint venture and we may look to monetize that this year. And that $100 million I would tell you I think there is some upside to that, but the bulk of that divestiture would be non-core solid waste. We should have $50 million to $100 million of dispositions in the core solid waste business but the upside would be all those non-core asset sales.", "Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Derek Sbrogna of Macquarie.", "Derek Sbrogna - Macquarie Research", "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question.", "David Steiner", "Good morning.", "Derek Sbrogna - Macquarie Research", "Good morning. I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about \u2013 it's very encouraging to see the internal revenue growth stays strong in fourth quarter 2% and you're guiding flat for 2014. Can you just talk about some of the things you're seeing and doing which gives you confidence that you'll be able to offset some of the CPI headwinds with some of the business that is not linked to CPI?", "David Steiner", "It's a great question because when we look at yield, frankly we don't look at the number, the 2.4% in the quarter, the 2% for 2014. We don't particularly look at that yield number. When we build our plan, we build our plan to determine the amount of dollars that will drop to the bottom line from all of our pricing actions because pricing actions are not just core price increases but it's also rollbacks, it's also the effect of lost business. There's a lot of different effects that go into what drops to the bottom line from pricing. So when we look at that, when we look at dollars to the bottom line, we think dollars to the bottom line will be very similar in 2014 to where they were in 2013. Now, you hit the nail right on the head. In order to get that we're going to have to do more robust price increases to offset the CPI. That CPI is what's going to drive the yield down toward the 2%. So as we look at 2014, we don't think there will be a material difference in the amount of dollars driven to the bottom line, but CPI will mute the numbers a little bit as far as yield goes.", "Derek Sbrogna - Macquarie Research", "Okay, that's helpful. And just one more. It's good to see the CapEx guidance essentially in line with 2013 levels. Is there anything we should be thinking about with regards to that number? I actually would have assumed it would have gone a little bit higher just kind of thinking that you would have seen cost inflation with regards to capital purchases and some of the initiatives you guys have put in place with the onboard computers and stuff like that?", "David Steiner", "Yes, when you look at CapEx, what we're doing in 2014 is making sure that we put the right amount of capital into our core solid waste business. We talked about it in the past. We just have to make sure that we aren't under investing in the core business and we aren't, and so primarily what you'll see in 2014 is that we are going to cut back on those types of investments that haven't been getting us the kind of returns that we want over the last few years, primarily recycling. And so we're not going to starve the core business, the CapEx will be a little bit down because of what we call sort of growth capital and capital for those other types of businesses that generally have not been earning their return on capital for the last two years.", "Derek Sbrogna - Macquarie Research", "That's very helpful. Thanks very much.", "David Steiner", "Certainly.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Fisher of Raymond James.", "William Fisher - Raymond James", "Thank you. Good morning. Just on the EPS growth, I think the midpoint is around 8% and obviously I mentioned organic growth is around 1%. Can you touch on some of the drivers there? Obviously you have a possibly lower share count, acquisitions and David you mentioned the pricing actions but it seems like you got to have some good cost controls because gross margins would seem to have rise?", "David Steiner", "Yes. Look, when we look at that 2014 just to try to sort of put it in context, I think that there is some potential upside on yield, I think there is some potential upside on free cash flow. But as you well know, Bill, the last two years we've predicted our recycling operations to be last year $0.02 negative, ended up $0.12 negative. The year before we had a similar type of result. And so we wanted to be very cautious on predicting \u2013 we said it before, we can drive sort of 8% to 12% earnings growth through the price volume combination but in order to get up into that low mid teens, we got to get help from waste to energy and from recycling. We haven't done that in the last few years. And so when we put together the plan, we said let's assume that we're going to be very cautious on getting any benefit from it. And frankly, when you look at the beginning of the year with slower growth in China, with the weather that's been impacting recycling volumes, I think that's a good assumption. So we wanted to be conservative because of those two big tailwinds or headwinds that we've had in the last couple of years.", "Jim Fish", "Bill, one of the reasons we talked about January which we've really never done before but one of the reasons we talked about January is because we didn't want folks to \u2013 two reasons. One is we were encouraged by our own results but most importantly we didn't want folks to mistake kind of the accruals there at the end of the year for a change in trend. And January clearly showed to us that the trend that we'd seen really for the first probably 10 months of the year is continuing into next year. So when we think about 2014, for whatever its worth, right, I mean January is one month out of 12 but we felt good about what we saw. I mean SG&A costs being better by $8 million but we felt good with what we saw really overall, I mean in line with a really tough weather month our core business was actually better than prior year. So, I think we've got a pretty good start going there and we'll see what February brings. February has been a tough weather month as well.", "William Fisher - Raymond James", "Okay, thanks. And hoping to follow-up with that David, you're keeping the yield north of 2% and I think last year you had some good success on the regulatory fee. Are there any new incentives or strategies this year? I notice the commercial price is really strong for you in Q4.", "David Steiner", "Frankly, 2014 is going to be sort of the same \u2013 it's a repeat of 2013. It's going to be the same things that drive it. Again, we talked a little bit about the CPI headwind that we have to overcome, but it's going to be the same types of things. But Bill, we'll never rule out doing something during the course of the year. We didn't build in any plans to increase that, but we'll see how the year plays out. And look, the reality is that as we've gone through the various cycles, we have never seen a dramatic amount of pushback to the fees. I think customers get the point that our cost structure is going up every year and so we have to recover that. So, could it happen in 2014? Absolutely. Is getting our target dependent upon it? No.", "William Fisher - Raymond James", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "David Steiner", "Certainly.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Corey Greendale of First Analysis.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "Hi. Good morning.", "David Steiner", "Good morning, Corey.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "I think David that you said something like half or two-thirds of the volume decline that you're projecting for '14 is because of national account. I'm just trying to get a sense what do you think is underlying market growth \u2013 volume growth in the market in 2014? And then on top of that, how much are you projecting the year of losing because of you being aggressive and being the price leader?", "David Steiner", "Again, I think 2014 from an overall volume perspective is going to be fairly similar to 2013. Look, we said it now for the last couple of years that what we need to see in order to really get robust volumes is we need to see an economy that's driven by housing starts, by new business starts and by industrial production, right. We can't seen an economy where growth is driven by non-infrastructure government spend and by the service sector. And so I think that's the big question for 2014. Are we going to start to or are we going to continue to see the rebound in housing and are we going to start to see new business generation? Again, when we plan for '14 we're planning like we aren't. Like we aren't going to see a dramatic uptick, and so from an overall volume point of view, I think what you\u2019ll see in 2014 will be similar to what you see in 2013 with collection volumes at least for us, with collection volumes remaining negative and landfill volumes remaining positive.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "Okay. And I would like just to offset the expectations, you\u2019ve given all the things you\u2019re seeing in Q1. When do you expect that Q1 will be the worst year-over-year comp in volume and it improves as you get to the end of the year?", "David Steiner", "Yes, I would be surprised if Q1 is not the worst year-over-year. Now the large national account that I talked about, we lost about $90 million of national account business last year. Our largest national account will lose in sort of mid-year this year. So, you\u2019ll get a little bit of that affect in the back half but because of the weather affects and because of the sandy affects and because of the national accounts, yes I would expect the first quarter to be toughest comp a quarter and for it to improve going forward.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "Okay. And by the effect it had on the competition of national accounts, is that coming from your large national competitor or are you seeing new businesses like Oakleaf forming?", "David Steiner", "I think it's a combination of both. And from a -- it doesn\u2019t matter where it's coming from, because even if it's a broker it's coming from our large national competitors. We don\u2019t do business with brokers. From our point of view we don\u2019t see why we would strengthen a competitor by acting as a subcontractor for these new brokers in various markets. We don\u2019t understand why you would help a competitor. So, we don\u2019t do business with the national brokers. So, even if the bid isn\u2019t won by our large national competitors they are doing business with those brokers so they\u2019re getting some of that business. I think the answer would be; yes, predominantly we\u2019re losing at the large national players either directly or indirectly because they\u2019re working for the brokers.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "Okay. And one quick one for Jim, there\u2019s a -- in the press release you talked about the $0.09 impact, some of that is the bonus accruals, but some of it is also risk management; can you just elaborate a little on that what, is that a one-time adjustment of what your expectation is for risk management expenses going forward?", "Jim Fish", "All right. So the risk management was a benefit actually prior year. We typically expect with our safety improvements we\u2019ve been seeing $0.01 to $0.02 per year. This year we actually went the other way. We had a couple of incidents, so we ended up with $0.01 charge; last year was a $0.02 benefit on risk management adjustments. So, is it a one-timer? Certainly the trend would say that we wouldn\u2019t see a repeat of that, but it's hard to say it's a one timer.", "David Steiner", "Yes, when you look at our safety numbers, our safety numbers are actually improving which what it leaves you to believe that we would have gotten a positive accrual. The problem is we had a couple or a few large incidents that we accrued for in the fourth quarter. So, again, like Jim said you\u2019d expect it to be positive, but you just never know when these large incidents are going to happen.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "Got it. Thank you.", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer of BB&T Capital Markets.", "Adam Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets", "Hi, good morning guys.", "David Steiner", "Good morning.", "Adam Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets", "Thanks for the detail you provided in terms of the yield and volume in your various businesses. I\u2019m curious from your perspective is the yield volume trade off working better on the industrial line than the commercial line. Because on the commercial line it looks like you\u2019re getting 5% price, but then giving up 5% volumes whereas on the industrial side you\u2019re getting a lot of price, but not giving up as much volumes?", "David Steiner", "Yes, when you look at a particular dollar\u2019s point of view maybe you\u2019d say the commercial is doing better. But I think you\u2019re right and it goes back to the earlier question about route density. You don\u2019t have the same issues with route density on the roll off side as you do with the commercial side. But look, in this business there is a few large chunks of business that you can go after very quickly. You can get large residential contracts, you can get large national accounts and you can get temporary roll off business. You can sort of flip a switch and get any of those three. The problem is you\u2019re going to get those three at very low margins. And we know that if we go out -- look if the large player goes out and grabs a bunch of volume of low margin what's the rest of the industry going to do? And so, from our perspective we\u2019ve got the right trade off. What we\u2019re expecting to see is our volumes recover with the economy not for all volumes to recover because we keep our price flat. We\u2019re going to continue to push our price and make sure that we get above that 2% so that we can expand margin.", "Jim Fish", "Adam, it's also worth mentioning that, that some piece of our volume loss is not a function of price, we don\u2019t know exactly how much that is, but some piece of it is related to -- for service and we are really focused at this point on customer service and improving the experience to the customer. And that doesn\u2019t -- getting that volume back has no negative impact on the price side as we would have if we were simply lowering price to get more volume, but we\u2019re keenly focused on that.", "Adam Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets", "Got it. Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then just as a follow-up, in terms of, you guys are obviously being aggressive on pricing which is probably a good thing for the whole industry. What exactly are you seeing in terms of how your competitors are responding to that?", "David Steiner", "Yes, I would say that we would love to see all of our competitor\u2019s large and small leave at it and follow, but we recognize that generally they aren\u2019t going to leave. So, mostly what we\u2019ve seen is what I would call rational behavior. Like there always is, there are pockets where you see some unusual actions generally those are in markets where you\u2019ve seen a lot of stress put on volumes, that we just recently saw a competitor lower their own price by $4 million in the North East on a disposal contract sort of paying against themselves. We saw a competitor drop price by -- at the landfill by 20% to 25% in South Florida because both of those markets are fairly challenged. But that\u2019s the kind of behavior that for us is going to cost us a lot of volumes and again we can\u2019t go out and do that type of behavior because look, if you look -- I have always said we can lead the industry in one or two ways. We can\u2019t control what they do. I mean, we have absolutely no control over what anyone else in the industry does other than us. But as the largest in the industry we can take one or two stances. We can say we\u2019re going to go after volume and give away price or we can say we\u2019re going to go after price and give away volume. And both of those can lead to what we call sort of a spiral affect either downward or upward. We long ago, look Jim said it; you can\u2019t lower price and create demand. Cherie Rice who used to be with our company used to say, with shoes if you lower the price of shoes people buy more shoes. When you lower the price of garbage people don\u2019t create more garbage. So, when you\u2019re working with a fixed pie you\u2019re always going to be benefited by driving yield up because you can\u2019t steal enough volume to make up for that yield. And if we go and start stealing volume then it creates that domino effect of everybody is stealing everybody\u2019s volume and that\u2019s not a path that we\u2019re willing to go down.", "Adam Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets", "Got it. Okay, thanks for the color.", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk of Wedbush Securities.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "Good morning, David.", "David Steiner", "Yes.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "Could you just clarify on the sandy headwind what that is for \u201914 in terms of a comp headwind on a volume basis?", "David Steiner", "Yes, again that\u2019s primarily in Q1. If you look at it in Q4 you saw that it was 0.6%. I would expect it to be a little bit more muted in the first quarter, but probably somewhere between that sort of 0.3% to 0.6%.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "Okay. And then should we assume the balance is national accounts?", "David Steiner", "Yes, I mean so you\u2019ve got national accounts and you\u2019ve got the commercial business going down but all of that is offset by landfill volumes going up. And again, if that goes back to the trade upright, if you tell me that my low margin national account business is going to go down and my landfill business is going to go up, I\u2019ll take that tradeoff six ways to Sunday.", "Jim Trevathan", "Al, again if you haven't heard it from the other guys, what you probably have that the weather is throwing volumes out of whack. Now we are pleased with the results as we said in January, but we\u2019ve had several operations, especially in February where we\u2019ve been shutdown in a big part in the South, I mean you expect to be shutdown in the North and Mid West, but when Atlanta shuts down for two days that generally is not expected going into the winter. So, I think there\u2019s going to be an impact from the weather that, that is yet to be determined.", "David Steiner", "Al, we say it every year that you can\u2019t make a call on full-year volumes based on the first quarter because of the seasonality. So we have said that every year since I have been here, to Jim\u2019s point more or so this year than ever before because it has been ridiculously a brutal winter not just in the places where we always have a brutal winner but in places where you don't have brutal winners. We had two days of school shutdowns in Houston, Texas from the winter weather. You saw what happened in Atlanta. So, what I would say, Al, is we have no idea what Q1 volumes are going to be. We'd expect that to not be robust. But again I don't think that's an indicator of what you're going to see for the full year. We'll really know what full year volumes are going to do once we see the seasonal upturn in March, April, May.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "Here's the broader question, David, and I appreciate the color from both you and Jim. You're guiding us for 1% volume decline and better than 2% pricing. If I look at the others in the industry, all the other metrics \u2013 those metrics have flipped and I certainly appreciate you going out and focusing on price. But can you explain why that is such a diverse message coming from you or why \u2013 I prefer you talk about your business but why you're seeing metrics that are different than the rest of the crew?", "David Steiner", "Yes. Look, I think we've seen a lot of metrics that are different than competitors. And again, you got to take out the fourth quarter accruals. But let's take a look at the full year and again, when we talk about metrics what we're talking about is income dollars and margins. So take a look at those metrics. In every line of business we increase dollars, we increase margins. I can only speak for us but we did it in every line of business. There's only one thing I can tell you, we've seen what happened when we hit that 1% yield and 1.5% volume, we saw it, we saw it in 2012. I guarantee you what's going to happen, margins go down and income from operations dollars go down particularly when the volume that you're picking up is low margin business. You just can't get enough yield in order to make up for \u2013 you can't get enough volume in order to make up for lower yield. I think everybody in this industry would acknowledge that you need to get sort of 1.8% to 2% yield in order to expand margins. So that's the question. Do you want to expand income from operations and margins do you want to see them go backwards? You have to get the yield in order to do that. Again, we've seen many times what happens in our business when we give away price to get volume and it's not a healthy tradeoff when it comes to income from operations dollars and margins.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "So it's fair to say that \u2013 and not that you want to quantify our guidance for '14 although it would be helpful, how much in basis points do you expect EBITDA margin to improve in '14 relative to '13 on an apples-to-apples basis?", "David Steiner", "Yes, and again remember as we look at 2013 we had to sort of look at the core solid waste business because of the negative effects from recycling and waste to energy and that was 150 basis points. Next year we should get detriments from those two businesses and we think if that plays out like that, we should get 50 to 100 basis points of margin expansion.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "Finally, on this waste to energy business, you take the impairment charge, why be in that business? Why aren't we thinking about or maybe you are but what strategic nature does that provide to your portfolio?", "David Steiner", "Yes. The waste to energy business is really two different businesses, right. The waste to energy business is electricity which is what they sell out of the back end of the plan and it's basically \u2013 landfill is the front end of the plan, right. They take in waste and they charge a tip fee. And so when we looked at it, we say that the electricity certainly is not core to us and it's not something that we have deep expertise in. Obviously our folks at Wheelabrator have expertise but we're not a power company, so we don't have a deepen expertise as folks whose primary business is power. And so you're absolutely right. On the power side, it's not strategic. On the tip fee side, it's absolutely strategic. We always saw the Wheelabrator plants to bottom with landfill because they can keep taking in waste and they never fill up. And so when we look at it from that point of view, it's absolutely strategic.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "Okay. Thank you.", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "Operator", "You have a question from the line of Michael Hoffman of Wunderlich.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "Good morning, gentlemen.", "David Steiner", "We don't have a question from the line of Michael Hoffman, we will have many questions from the line of Michael Hoffman.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "How are you doing, David?", "David Steiner", "Good, Michael. I'm doing great.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "Well, I got to have to live up to that now. I only really had one written down, but I guess I could make a bunch more up.", "David Steiner", "Don't feel like you have to live up.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "Okay. So, if I can follow-on the last question, the way that was answered would say a creative thought about maintaining that strategic exposure to the tip fee side but finding somebody else who could actually leverage the electricity side is not off the table.", "David Steiner", "Yes. Look, when we look at the electricity side, we're always looking at what we can do to improve it. In the past we've hedged it but yes, I mean we're always looking for ways that we can take that \u2013 where we can take the volatility out of the earning stream.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "Okay. On the volume side, where should \u2013 you give us some great tables, so one of them is called operating revenues by lines of business and when we think about where things are gone because of, like, lost national account or Sandy, can you point out \u2013 like is the lost national account coming out of the industrial line or is that coming out of commercial because there was a pretty steep decline in both?", "David Steiner", "Yes. A little bit of both. It depends on what type of national account customer you have but it's going to come out of both. I'd say roughly sort of 50-50, maybe a little bit more lean toward the permanent roll off side.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "Okay. So one other things that hasn't been discussed and I have to believe you're seeing this is that if you want a same-store basis in your commercial business which is \u2013 that small container business which is \u2013 if you're going to get what you pointed to earlier, housing starts leads to new household formation which leads to new business formation. This volume shows up there. How would you characterize the volume in the container that's still there year end and year out?", "David Steiner", "Yes. Let's talk a little about the commercial business because I would tell you, Michael, when you looked at the lines of business, what I would tell you is look, if we're going to lose low margin temporary roll off business, I'm not going to lose a heck of a lot of sleep over that, right. If we're going to lose low single digit national account business, I'm not going to lose a lot of sleep over that. Now don't get me wrong. I would love to have that volume. The problem is what does that do for the pricing dynamic? But when I'm losing those low margin lines of business, I'm not particularly upset by it. I would tell you that the commercial line of business is the one \u2013 if you could tell me which one line of business do we want to get focused on to stem the losses, I would tell you it's the commercial line and it's because again going back to that earlier question. The route density is \u2013 the benefit you get from route density is incredible and that's why as Jim said, that's why we're sort of putting some more effort into customer retention without using products, right. But when you look at that small container business what you've seen over the last couple of years is sort of the amount of waste going into container, very sort of mildly from negative 2% to positive 2%. So we just haven't seen that real kick start that's going to dramatically change those commercial volumes. Again, I think in the natural economic cycle you'll see it, right, as new houses get built no one builds a new gas station in the middle of nowhere. No one builds a new grocery store in the middle of nowhere, but as new subdivisions start getting built then they got to build a gas station, they got to build a drycleaner. And so I think new business starts naturally trend behind housing starts. And so if we continue to see housing starts positive into '14, I would hope that we start to see more new small business creation and if we can get that 2% to 3% GDP, hopefully that \u2013 at a very minimum will at least stabilize those volumes.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "So, if I take what I'm hearing what you're saying is that there is a slightly positive trend line that's starting to replicate or match this improving housing start number but not enough yet to change the economic model, but the direction \u2013 it's moving in the right direction?", "David Steiner", "I think that's absolutely right.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "Okay. Changing gears, capital spending, would you break \u2013 the 1.2 to 1.3 or take the midpoint 1.25, how does that break out in your definition of growth versus maintenance?", "Jim Fish", "Michael, we said last year that we had kind of redefined that. There was some growth \u2013 had otherwise been considered capital previously that kind of we re-titled to maintenance capital. If we had a contract that came up for re-bid, previously that would have been considered growth capital as we went through the process of evaluating and that now is considered maintenance capital, I mean even if the contract requires new vehicles. So, at this point the growth capital number has shrunk pretty considerable and what we\u2019re left with is a maintenance capital number that\u2019s probably in the $900 million to $1 billion range, growth capital is the $200 million to $300 million. Jim and I have taken a very discriminating view as David said when we look at -- when we make capital expense decisions we discriminate and we discriminate against those who provide low returns.", "David Steiner", "Michael when you look at what I traditionally call growth capital, I\u2019ll divide it into three categories. You\u2019ve got landfill gas to energy, you\u2019ve got alternative technologies and you\u2019ve got recycling. Those are sort of the three big buckets that we spent what we\u2019ll call \u201cgrowth capital on the last five years\u201d. In 2014, you\u2019re not going to see a lot of spending in recycling or in alternative technologies. You\u2019re going to see more -- you\u2019ll see we\u2019re spending in landfill gas to energy, but you\u2019re not going to see it in those two areas and the obviously question is why? Well because we aren\u2019t seeing the returns in those areas. And so, again as Jim said, we certainly aren\u2019t starving the business, we think we\u2019re at a good level of CapEx, and we don\u2019t expect to see that dramatically go up over the next few years.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "Okay. And speaking of recycling, when you think about your efforts on going back to a customer like you did post the great recession in establishing pricing floors, what's the reception been on, we really need to talk about the quality you\u2019re sending us and if you don\u2019t send better quality we got to charge you more?", "David Steiner", "Yes, I think the reception has been I would say, has been fine. We haven't, those are not hard conversations to have. I think the more important thing Michael is what's going to happen going forward. I mean, I like in this to what we did in the early 2000\u2019s with the fuel surcharge. When we first started the fuel surcharge rather municipality said, well we don\u2019t have a fuel surcharge in our contract, so we\u2019re not going to allow you to pay it if you take an exception for the fuel surcharge and we said fine, we\u2019re not going to bid. After a while that became an industry standard. Other industry players said, well gosh we\u2019re getting killed by fuel too, so we\u2019re not going to bid if there\u2019s not a fuel surcharge. And now virtually all contracts have been with a fuel surcharge. And so going forward the question is, we\u2019re not going to bid these contracts if they don\u2019t have the types of provisions that we need in order to make money. The question is, is the industry going to do like they did with the fuel surcharge and say gosh, we aren\u2019t making any money either so we\u2019re going to -- we\u2019re not going to bid these contracts. That\u2019s going to be the big question going forward. Is someone going to be optimistic enough that they\u2019re going to bid contracts without the protections that they need in order to make sure they make a return on the investment or are they going to do like we do and say, look we want to do -- we want to be the largest recycler in North America, we don\u2019t have any intention of not being. But we also are not in this to lose money and we got to systemically change the way our contracts work going forward so that we can make sure we make an adequate return. The contamination level only gets to a certain amount of dollars. The rebate is a big part of it too. So, you have -- and then again educating the consumer. So you have to go at it from all of these angles and so I would tell you the reception has been fine, but just getting a good reception from municipalities and changing those contracts doesn\u2019t get us anywhere near where we want to be from a return point of view. The only way we get there is if we fix these contracts going forward.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "Okay. And then, Jim Fish on cash flow from operations, what's it going to -- is it just margin that gets you from 17.6% of revenues to 20% target or is there working capital as well?", "Jim Fish", "Yes, so there\u2019s probably four things and we saw them in January and I think we\u2019ll see them for the rest of the year that\u2019s the drive cash flow from operations and ultimately free cash flow. Those four things, well and I guess I\u2019m speaking about free cash flow here because I\u2019m including capital in there, but cash flow from operations healed of course and cost control, both SG&A cost control and operating cost control and then when you take that to free cash flow CapEx. And of course as you mentioned working capital and it's an item we haven't talked about on this call, but it's been an area of focus for us particularly in the last two quarters of the year. To give you a couple of numbers we improved our DSO by two days, not happy with that -- happy with it it's in the right direction but not happy with the number. We\u2019ve got to improve DSO more than that, and I think you\u2019ll see that in 2014 our days to pay. We really didn\u2019t start working on that in earnest until August. And from August through December we improved our days to pay by -- we increased that metric by three days. And really there\u2019s quite a bit more to come there in 2014 as those pay cycles, we didn\u2019t change payment terms until November, December timeframe. So, I think you\u2019ll start to see a benefit in working capital from continued improvement in DSO and then a full-year of improvement in days to pay.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "Okay, that\u2019s great. And then just couple of housekeeping items. In your guidance, what share count are you using to do the $2.30 to $2.35?", "David Steiner", "What we would expect Michael is that we offset dilution that we bought back at least enough shares to offset dilution.", "Jim Fish", "I think we were $470 million at the end of the year or so and we would buy back shares as David said in 2014 to offset dilution.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "And your dilution runs about 2% to 3% of share count?", "Jim Fish", "Correct.", "David Steiner", "That\u2019s about right.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "Yes, okay. And then the tax rate in \u201913 is supposed to be lumpy in the quarters, how do we think about that in \u201914, because it tends to have a pretty -- since you\u2019ve given an EPS number, it tends to have pretty dramatic impact on EPS by quarters.", "David Steiner", "Yes, we can get you the quarterly number, that the annual number is basically flat at about 35%.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "Right, okay great. I hope I didn\u2019t disappoint you. I could come up with some more if you want, but I\u2019m good.", "Jim Fish", "That was excellent.", "Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities", "Thank you guys.", "David Steiner", "Thanks Michael.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey of Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. Good morning. David, can you hear me?", "David Steiner", "Hi, Alex. Yes.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs", "Excellent. So just one question and a follow-on to it; can you talk about how you expect your yield to perform at the landfills relative to the collection business in 2014 and just from a volume perspective could we expect that volumes at the landfill at some point are going to begin to narrow with what you\u2019re seeing on the collection side or is there is a reason to think you can continue to outperform on the landfill side volume wise relative to collection?", "David Steiner", "Yes, we certainly expect volumes at the landfill to be positive in 2014. And like we said, particularly in the landfill line of business where you\u2019re seeing positive volumes that should lead to better yield.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thank you.", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Barbara Noverini of Morningstar.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar", "Good morning, everybody.", "David Steiner", "Good morning.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar", "Jim, you referred to asset rationalization in your closed collection facilities and specifically mentioned a few cash flow negative landfills. We\u2019ve talked about this in the past, but how much of this that was just reported was related to recycling assets and further is it fair to say that asset rationalization is continuing in your recycling portfolio as you work through these contracts nor would you say you've got a pretty good handle on projected future cash flows of your portfolio at present?", "Jim Trevathan", "So a bigger portion of that asset impairment -- the biggest portion of it was of course the landfills, a piece of it was recycling facilities. We\u2019re not aware of any additional impairment\u2019s at this point, but we always review our assets and we\u2019re appropriate we would close the facilities. We felt like this year we\u2019ve gone through a pretty expensive analysis and by the time we got to the fourth quarter we\u2019re prepared to make a call on those.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar", "Okay, great. And just, quickly on the large national accounts businesses that you were talking about earlier, how much of that is related to disappointment on your end from what they\u2019re demanding on the solid waste front versus the recycling front. Have you seen that demand -- from those customers in recycling is above what you\u2019re prepared to give at this point?", "David Steiner", "No, when you look at the national accounts, most of the national accounts do want recycling, and frankly that\u2019s one of the positives that we have, that we have the largest network of recycling facilities. So, the more recycling they want the better chance we have at winning the bids. Basically what it's come down to is that, our primary competition as we talked about is, other large national players and then the brokers. And I think the brokers are probably \u2013 they're both very competitive but the broker's model which by the way we have a brokerage model too, the broker's model is go out and try to get very low margin work done by subcontractors and as long as there's folks willing to do that, they're going to be able to continue to reduce price. From our point of view, we always say we don't need to practice our business. We've got plenty of ways to practice. We don't need to go out and do it for low margins. And so if other folks want to fill up their capacity with that low margin business that's quite all right. When the economy comes back and we start seeing better volume, we'll have that access capacity that we can stretch and to get new volumes at higher margin and obviously those competitors won't.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar", "Okay. Good. That's it for me. Thanks very much.", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Jeff Osborne of Stifel.", "Jeffery Osborne - Stifel Nicolaus & Co.", "Great. Good morning. Just a couple quick questions from my end. I was wondering, David, on the national accounts side, you mentioned there was a 90 million headwind in 2013. And the largest customer, I think you articulated, would come off-line in mid this year. Would you expect that number to be higher than 90 million in terms of lost revenue in 2014?", "David Steiner", "You mean as far as new loss revenue or the [Technical Difficulty] cross over geographic market areas, they become a national account. So a lot of those national accounts are regional. And the bulk of our national account business is great business because we can create that route density. And so I wouldn't expect that we're going to lose another $90 million of national accounts in 2014 and we'll continue to add sort of the smaller regional national accounts. So, overall the net effect will be that we will lose some national accounts but we expect that our national accounts EBIT dollars will actually be flat to up.", "Jeffery Osborne - Stifel Nicolaus & Co.", "Understand. In that same vein, can you just touch on the commercial side of the business in terms of service frequency increases, excluding the national account lost sales in 2013? What kind of trajectory or the rhythm was through the year, and maybe touch on January? Are you seeing greater frequency increases excluding the lost customers?", "David Steiner", "Yes, we haven't seen the January numbers but again what we saw in 2013 was sort of a fairly narrow band of positive, negative sort of down 2%, up 2%. We had a couple of numbers that were up 2% or 3% or down 2% or 3%, but basically what I would say is that the overall trend in 2013 was slightly positive and we would expect that trend to continue in fact, probably get a little bit better in 2014.", "Jeffery Osborne - Stifel Nicolaus & Co.", "Excellent. And my last question is just can you touch on the couple hundred million in growth CapEx that you mentioned before? I think it was to Michael's question. In particular I was looking for where you are in terms of your natural gas fleet. Did you accelerate that last year with the accelerated depreciation? And then would you look to decelerate the amount of new nat-gas vehicles in 2014 added or just an update as to where that is exiting the year and what the plans are for this year would be helpful?", "Jim Trevathan", "Yes, Jeff, Jim Trevathan here. We still plan to buy about 90% of our new trucks will be natural gas trucks. We're installing about 15 new locations across the country where we've put the infrastructure in and we'll continue that. The payback was excellent in 2013 and we expect the very same in '14. I don't see any change in that strategy at all around implementing natural gas fleet but our customers like it. It's obviously cleaner air. Both residential and commercial customers appreciate it and we'll continue that focus.", "Jeffery Osborne - Stifel Nicolaus & Co.", "And just to put it in perspective, Jim, in terms of the percentage of the fleet today, are you in the mid-teens or where about are we?", "Jim Trevathan", "16%.", "Jeffery Osborne - Stifel Nicolaus & Co.", "16%, okay, thank you very much.", "Jim Trevathan", "16% is the total fleet. We put about 900 trucks on the road that were natural gas in '13. We moved that percentage up a couple of points.", "Jeffery Osborne - Stifel Nicolaus & Co.", "Thank you.", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "Jim Fish", "Thank you.", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. David Steiner for closing remarks.", "David Steiner", "Thank you. As we said, from a business point of view, 2014 is up to a great start. But from a personal point of view 2014 is not such a great start. We recently lost two of our corporate family to cancer. I wanted to say that our sympathies go out to the families of Jim Perry and Scott Stadelman. I can promise you that they may be gone, but they\u2019re not forgotten.

Okay, Mr. Ed Egl, you may begin your conference.", "Ed Egl", "Thank you, Jenisha. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us to our first quarter, 2014 earnings conference call. With me this morning are David Steiner, President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Fish, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Trevathan, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.", "Before we get started, please note that we have filed a Form 8-K this morning that includes the earnings press release and is available on our website at www.wm.com.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the express written consent of Waste Management is prohibited.", "Now, I will turn the call over to Waste Management\u2019s President and CEO, David Steiner.", "David Steiner", "Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. Our fourth quarter conference call we said the January results indicated the strength of our business. That strength continued in February and March and lead to a strong start into the year. The momentum in our yield and cost control programs continued throughout Q1. Our field operations teams also did a great job of managing the effects of the severe weather that probated the quarter.", "As a result, we are in $0.49 per share, an increase of more than 22% when compared to the first quarter of 2013. We saw good improvement in all areas, income from operations, operating EBITDA, margin and free cash flow. We\u2019re encouraged by the strong start and we expect the momentum to continue as we are heading in our seasonal upturn.", "Our yield programs continue to drive our margin expansion. For the first quarter, our collection and disposal yield was 2.6% which is the seventh consecutive quarter of sequential yield improvement. The effect of low inflation rates on our CPI based contract are certainly a headwind, but we overcame that headwind to drive yield to its highest level in three years.", "Core price increased to 4.2%, a year-over-year improvement of 100 basis points and the highest level we\u2019ve ever seen. Each of our lines of business had positive yield except C&D which was impacted by higher price Super Storm Sandy time we received in 2013.", "Average rates per unit for MSW, commercial and industrial are also the highest rates that we\u2019ve ever seen. When compared to the first quarter of 2013, average rates increased 5.6% in the industrial line, 4.9% in the commercial line and 4% in our MSW line. This is a tremendous accomplishment by our team.", "As we\u2019ve repeatedly stated, we need yield at about 2% to see margin expansion. And we will execute our yield program to continue to drive that expansion. Clearly this has some effect on volumes. But the tradeoff remains very positive.", "Turning to volumes, in the first quarter, volumes were negative 1.8% which is an improvement of 40 basis points from the fourth quarter. The losses in our commercial volumes improved to 30 basis points from the fourth quarter. But I wouldn\u2019t yet call that improvement of trend.", "Roll off volumes were down about 200 basis points from the fourth quarter, but we would expect those losses to moderate as we enter our seasonal upturn. Our landfill volumes, particularly special waste, were strong in the first quarter. However, they were offset by declines in the collection lines of business.", "As we\u2019ve said in the past, we\u2019re not focused on getting the most volumes, we\u2019re focused on getting the best volumes. We\u2019re looking for the best mix of yield and volume to drive income from operations, dollars and margin. Jim will give more details, but despite negative volumes, overall income from operations grew more than 13%, and our income from operations margin grew 140 basis points.", "Operating EBITDA increased about 7%, and operating EBITDA margins increased 100 basis points. Our traditional solid waste business has performed very well in the first quarter. We saw a strong income from operations and margin improvement in our commercial, industrial, landfill and transportation lines of business. And our overall traditional solid waste income from operations margin, grew 50 basis points.", "Our recycling operations drove a little less than one set decline in our earnings per share compared to the first quarter of 2013. This decline is due to the 1.8% drop in average commodity prices for the quarter and weather related operating challenges.", "We\u2019ve seen our operating cost improved as we tighten our enforcement on contaminated loads and modify the methods for calculating rebates to customers. We\u2019re also engaged in broad based efforts with our recycling customers, consumer brand owners and others to educate them of the evolving recycling in commodities markets and how to reduce contamination. Overall, we still expect to achieve our recycling guidance of flat earnings per share when compared to 2013.", "Turning to our waste energy business, in the first quarter operating results were essentially flat when compared to 2013. But overall results benefited from a spike [ph] in electricity prices in the quarter, driven by the cold and the normal winter [ph]. In April, we\u2019re seeing electricity prices moderate as warmer weather has arrived on the East Coast. So we expect earnings from our waste energy operations to be similar to 2013 in the remaining three quarters.", "Looking at free cash flow, the first quarter of 2014 is the highest free cash flow quarter since 2008 at $484 million, driven by our strong results in working capital management, supplemented by $166 million of divestitures, primarily our waste energy joint venture in China.", "So 2014 is up to a strong start. And we have the momentum to achieve our four-year goals of adjusted earnings per share between $2.30 and $2.35 per fully diluted share. With the strong first quarter free cash flow, we now expect 40 to free cash flow [ph] between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion.", "As we move to the second quarter and see the seasonal upturn, we will likely refine the various elements of our guidance in connection with our second quarter results. But for now, we\u2019ve demonstrated that our field and corporate managers can execute our pricing and cost control program. And through their efforts, we\u2019re confident we can achieve our goal.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jim, to discuss our first quarter results in more detail.", "Jim Fish", "Thank you, David. As David mentioned, we had a strong performance in all aspects of our income statement. Our revenue grew 1.8% in the first quarter to $3.4 billion. Strong yield and acquisition revenue were the main drivers with volume declines and a negative foreign currency translation yielding revenue growth. The effects impact on revenue was approximately $17 million.", "We continue to see improvement in all our cost lines. With respect to operating cost, operating cost as a percent of revenue improved 50 basis points to 65.7%, an increase $23 million in the first quarter, both [ph] associated with recently acquired businesses increased almost $30 million and were partially offset by improvements in disposal on labor cost [ph].", "SG&A cost improved $15 million to $375 million, and improved as the percent of revenue by 70 basis points to 11%. With the strong results in the first quarter, we expect us to achieve our full year SG&A goals.", "Turning to cash flow, for the first quarter we generated $484 million of free cash flow, an increase of $136 million when compared to 2013. We accomplished this in part by growing our net cash provided by operating activities, $7 million to $584 million, improving working capital and by maintaining discipline on capital spending.", "We grew free cash flow despite over $100 million of headwinds from the payment of our annual incentive compensation and the maturity of interest rate swaps related to a plan senior note issuance. Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $266 million, the same amount that we spend in the first quarter of 2013. We also had some divestitures in the quarter, most notably we monetized our investment in China for about $155 million. Even if you exclude the divestiture proceeds, our free cash flow, up $318 million was still the highest free cash flow since 2008.", "Looking at internal revenue growth, we continue to execute on the tradeoff between yield and volume to determine the best mix in order to maximize income from operations, dollars and the margins. Our strategy worked in the first quarter just as it did for the full year 2013. For the total company, in the first quarter, our collection and disposal yield was 2.6% with volumes declining 1.8%. This lead to income from operations growing $55 million, margin growing 140 basis points, operating EBITDA growing $49 million, and operating EBITDA margin growing 100 basis points.", "Looking at the commercial and industrial lines of business, the yield and volume tradeoff worked well. In both cases, strong yield results offset volume declines resulting in commercial income from operations growing more than $6 million, and margin growing 50 basis points. In industrial, income from operations grew almost $7 million and margin expanded 110 basis points. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion in industrial.", "So yield above 2% in those lines of business drove margin expansion despite negative volumes. This did not hold true in our residential line where yield was 1.1% driven by low CPI. In addition, we lost a few contracts that we saw \u2013 where we saw competition significantly lower price the levels that were below our required return on capital. We expect to see margins improved as our cost control programs drive down operating costs and as we add new residential contracts at acceptable returns.", "In the landfill line of business for the first quarter, we saw the benefits of positive volume and positive yield. Total landfill volumes increased 3.8%, combined special waste and revenue generating cover volumes were positive [ph] 7.9%. And MSW volumes grew by 0.9%.", "C&D volume declines 2.2% primarily due to a tough Sandy comparison. This lead to income from operations growing $11 million which is the fourth consecutive quarter of growth, and margins grew 130 basis points.", "Finally, looking at our other financial metrics at the end of the first quarter, our weighted average cost to debt was 4.9%, and our debt to total capital ratio was 62.8%. So pulling away portion of [ph] our total debt portfolio was 18% at the end of the quarter.", "Our income tax rate in the first quarter was 29.6% due to a non-cash adjustment to our differed taxes from state tax law changes. This benefited us by a positive $0.04 per diluted share in the first quarter. Our year-over-year benefit was a positive $0.02 per share.", "For the next three quarters, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 35%. Our first quarter results have started 2014 on the right path. We are encouraged by the results which we could not been achieved without the hard work of our employees. I know they are focused on making 2014 a successful year, and I thank them for that.", "And with that Jenisha, let\u2019s open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) We\u2019ll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roaster.", "Your first question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari of Credit Suisse.", "Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Good morning. Thank you. Just \u2013 hey, good morning. Just a question on the volume side, do you have a sense of how much of your volume loss is self-inflicted in, in terms of walking away from low margin business versus other competitors in the market as being more aggressive? And then separately on the volume side, is the \u2013 is the spring slow down within housing going to push out some of the commercial new business formation in your business? What\u2019s your view on those two topics within volume?", "David Steiner", "Yes, Hamzah, on the first one, I don\u2019t think the slowdown in housing will push it out. As you know, we\u2019ve been waiting for that commercial volume to see significant improvement. I don\u2019t think that that one quarter slowing down, when the housing starts, our re-sales will have an effect on that.", "On the other one, you\u2019ll have to look at the various lines of business, right? I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt that in the residential line of business and in the industrial line of business, we walk away from low margin business. There is absolutely no doubt about that.", "On the commercial side, there is just not a lot of growth. And our strategy is that we aren\u2019t going to chase volumes because if we chase volumes and because there\u2019s not a lot of growth, we\u2019re going to have to take those volumes from someone else. And that\u2019s just not something we\u2019re willing to do. We\u2019re not willing to go out and grab volumes at a low price because if we do that, that\u2019s what starts the downward spiral in price. And so, when we see those volumes pickup, we fully expect to get our fair share of that.", "So I would tell you that that we walk away from residential and industrial business that\u2019s low margin. When it\u2019s low margin, it\u2019s generally low return on capital. And so, we\u2019re making a good business decision to walk away from it.", "On the commercial side, I wouldn\u2019t say that we are intentionally walking away from business, I would say that we\u2019re more focused on retaining the business that we have than going out and trying to get new volumes with low price. But once we see the rising tide, when we see those commercial volumes pickup, we fully expect to get our fair share.", "Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And then just on pricing, could you \u2013 could you give us your thought process in putting up the pricing bonus structure? You put a pricing gate [ph] in place a couple years ago, and then it went away. How prominent is this pricing gate [ph] that you\u2019ve set up? And should we expect \u2013 is this a signal to the market that you\u2019re more disciplined and you were not disciplined previously? How do you \u2013 how should we think about these pricing gates [ph] coming in sporadically and then maybe going out at certain times?", "David Steiner", "Yes, I think \u2013 look, Hamzah, I think everybody knows that the strategy at Waste Management is that you\u2019re always better off getting yield over volumes, right? And so, we\u2019re always going to be a yield-focused company.", "Now, you can get yield in a lot of ways. You can have the gate [ph] which that you mentioned which is sort of a hammer if you will, you can have \u2013 look, we meet with our folks every month to see how they\u2019re doing, and you\u2019ve got that as sort of an honor on it [ph]. And then you can also put in place an incentive program. You know, look, when we saw \u2013 when we saw the yield go down dramatically in 2012, we knew we had to do something dramatic.", "And so, we weren\u2019t going to just rely on meeting with folks every month and saying obviously your job is expected to be driving yield, we wanted to get a little bit more incentive. So we decided to make it a positive incentive. And as you can see what we\u2019ve \u2013 look, we\u2019ve quadrupled yield since we put that in place. If that\u2019s what we have to do to get it done, it is a great tradeoff for all our shareholders, I can guarantee it.", "So there will always be something that we will do with respect to yield. Either we\u2019ll put in place a gate, we\u2019ll put in place an incentive program or we\u2019ll make sure that we have our focus on it so that our field mangers focuses on it. We will always do that. And so, we\u2019re going to use those three \u2013 combination of those three things to continue to drive yield.", "Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. And just lastly, I\u2019ll turn it over, maybe for Jim. Could you help us understand the \u2013 why you are not raising earnings guidance but free cash flow guidance is going up? Is that all asset divestitures or maybe give us a little more color on the delta between that?", "Jim Fish", "Yes. So couple of questions there, Hamzah. And I think the reason we\u2019re not raising free cash flow guidance is because while we were pleased with the quarter, this is the first quarter. And so, we\u2019ve said that we\u2019ll refine our guidance in the second quarter. The \u2013 when you think about free cash flow, I think that was question was kind of the components of free cash flow, and I think that\u2019s kind of what you\u2019re getting at is which pieces of it are sustainable and which are not.", "Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Right.", "Jim Fish", "You know, if you think about free cash flow and break it down to its component parts, CapEx was essentially flat, it was based \u2013 exactly flat actually. And then EBITDA was up $49 million driven by a nice quarter for weedy [ph], driven by some core business improvements and driven by SG&A, cost controls. And then the other piece, the other big mover there outside of divestitures which was almost exclusively the Chinese divestiture, the other big mover was cash flow from operations. And we had about $100 million \u2013 $106 million to be exact of headwind there from the termination of the \u2013 or from the core starting swap [ph] and then from the bonus payout.", "And so, working in the right direction there was DSO and DPO [ph] which were better by a day and five days respectively, so year-over-year. And I think we have some room to improve there. So I would argue that that\u2019s \u2013 the quality here is pretty strong. Most of what I\u2019ve talked about, I would argue is sustainable with the obvious exception of the onetime asset divestiture.", "David Steiner", "Hey, Hamzah, I think the important thing is that we did $318 million without divestitures which is the highest we\u2019ve had since 2008, and that\u2019s with $100 million of headwind. And the beauty of it is those $100 million of headwinds or first quarter headwinds, they don\u2019t recur in the second and third and fourth quarter.", "So we had a great first quarter despite the headwinds. We won\u2019t have those kind of headwinds in the \u2013 to three quarters [ph]. So obviously we\u2019re very optimistic about free cash flow. But as Jim said, we\u2019ve always said, whether it\u2019s a good winter weather or a bad winter weather, it is hard to judge a full year by the first three months of the year.", "So we like to see the seasonal upturn before we make a call on how the full year is going to play out. And so, we thought that\u2019s what the \u2013 we thought that\u2019s what would be prudent to do right here which is to say, let\u2019s see what the seasonal upturn bring in the second quarter, and we\u2019ll refine the guidance as appropriate.", "Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Box of KeyBanc Capital Market.", "Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Market", "Good morning.", "David Steiner", "Good morning.", "Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Market", "Question for you guys on landfill pricing and volume dynamics. Before you release on an active landfill base is it looks like volumes were up by about 3.4%. One, can you guys give us a sense on yield for those landfills? And then two, you had a peer that reported landfill volumes up, I believe it was 90% earlier this week, can you just help me bridge the gap there? I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s a function of just geography or maybe if you\u2019re seeing a little bit less volume here because of your pricing strategy as well?", "David Steiner", "Yes, look, the landfill volume it\u2019s driven those big numbers but when it happens for us, I got \u2013 I won\u2019t speak to other companies. But when we get those type of big numbers, it\u2019s generally special waste jobs. And you got two things going on there, you got year-over-year cost, right? If we had a great special waste quarter last year, it\u2019s harder comp. And then you got the fact that those special waste jobs are jobs that they vary from season to season.", "So what I would tell you is that we are very encouraged by the landfill volumes, we still see a very strong pipeline. So we\u2019d expect them to be positive for the full year. From a pricing perspective as we said, look, price doesn\u2019t particularly matter as much as special waste, and then C&D as it does and MSW.", "So when we look at the \u2013 at the yield components, we look at MSW, when we look at the average unit price so that \u2013 in the MSW line, we grew at 4%. So we\u2019re well on our way to getting what we\u2019ve said is sort of that 5% to 7% price increase in the landfill, at 4% we\u2019re well on our way to getting there.", "Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Market", "Perfect, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And, David, I want to practice [ph] this question by just saying, I think that pricing discipline out of you guys is critical. But I\u2019m just curious when you started your pricing strategy about a year ago, were you expecting your peers to buy into raising rates? And then maybe what\u2019s your view on sustaining the strategy if the waste recovery continues to be relatively slow, is this something that you could stick with to this magnitude for another year or two?", "David Steiner", "Yes, look, I can\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t speak to what we \u2013 what we expect or we don\u2019t expect that of our competitors. All I could tell you is what we\u2019re going to do. And it goes back to what I said earlier, look, when you got sort of stick pie [ph], there\u2019s only one way you can get volumes. And that is to go out and steal them from someone else. And we\u2019ve seen what happens when we do that. Look, we\u2019ve done that in the past where we steal volumes from someone else, what do they do? They steal them from us. And before you know it, you have a downward ice spiral. And you all have heard me say it a million times, it\u2019s a two to one or three to one tradeoff. You can get 1% of price and lose 2% to 3% of your volume and you\u2019re still ahead of the game.", "And so, you just can\u2019t chase that downward spiral because you can never get enough volumes to make up for the drop in price. So you\u2019re not going to see that strategy change for us. Now, look, will we rather have more volumes? Absolutely, but what I\u2019m saying is when we get more volumes it\u2019s not going to be because we\u2019re going out and steal them at a lower price, it\u2019s going to be because that everyone is getting more volumes, and we fully expect to get our fair share of the increase in volume.", "And so, what we\u2019ve seen is that the \u2013 we think the economy has moderated. We don\u2019t expect to see the volumes improved dramatically, but we don\u2019t expect to see them decreased dramatically either. And obviously we\u2019re going to see improvement during the second quarter with the seasonal upturn.", "So I would say that we have a sort of a muted sense of optimism on volumes, but that \u2013 you\u2019re not going to see us change our strategy because it\u2019s a strategy that drives shareholder value. And that is we\u2019re always going to favor yield over volume.", "Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Market", "Right. Just one quick one, Jim, can you remind us what the flow through is for that $27 million variance for electricity?", "Jim Fish", "Well, so most of that electricity was from rates, Joe. In fact, I would say it was \u2013 it was exclusively from rates. Our kilowatt hours were actually down slightly due to some permanent plant shutdowns, reduced load and some operating changes.", "So I would say that that\u2019s a top line benefit we saw was exclusively from rates. And so, that ends up flowing through the bottom line.", "Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Market", "Great. Thanks for your time guys.", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman of Wunderlich.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich", "Hey, good morning, David, Jim and Jim.", "David Steiner", "Good morning, Michael.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich", "So I need a little clarity because there\u2019s numbers being thrown around and I\u2019m \u2013 I mean, I may be confused myself. In your release, you show \u2013 and the data point I think is a terrific one you show. But you show having done 21.3 million tons at the landfill and 14 versus 211 and then at \u2013 a year ago, and 211 has Sandy in it.", "So to get to the \u2013 I mean, that\u2019s just about 1% which I thought was great given the Sandy comparison, but everybody is talking about 3% or better, help me understand how I\u2019m understanding volume at the landfill as I could.", "David Steiner", "Yes, look, Michael, as you know, when we look at internal revenue growth, we don\u2019t look at it on a tonnage basis. We look at it \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of different mix issues that go into it. And so, when we\u2019re giving those numbers, you\u2019re looking at mix and price. And then when we look at, at least at C&D, I\u2019m sorry. When we look at special waste, we put all of it into volume because you can\u2019t really pull out the price.", "And so, you might get some lower deviations there, but when we look at, we say, the numbers are obviously indicative of the trend, and I think you hit the nail on the head. The trend is obviously positive, particularly given the Sandy comparisons, particularly given that so many of our operations were shut down during the quarter, but the landfill trends are clearly positive.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich", "Okay. So the 3.8 when that was given earlier, that\u2019s actually the revenue growth or is that how you \u2013 I just want to \u2013 I actually think it\u2019s great that you showed the 1% volume the way you\u2019ve put it in the chart given all of the headwind issue you just described.", "David Steiner", "Right.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich", "So what I\u2019m \u2013 I just \u2013", "David Steiner", "You know, the 3.8 is the total growth from volume. But again, with special waste because special waste prices and transportation cost move around a lot, we don\u2019t split out price and volume and special waste, we put it all into volume. So that excuse the numbers a little bit. But again \u2013", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich", "[Indiscernible]", "David Steiner", "[Indiscernible] but directionally you can see they\u2019re both \u2013 they\u2019re both positive directionally.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich", "Perfect. So the follow on to that would be, do you ever recall [ph] out of the 211 that\u2019s total tons and that you showed in disposal, how much of that was Sandy? So in reality, the landfill in 1Q \u201814 weather aside saw better than a 1% volume growth, tons [indiscernible]?", "David Steiner", "Yes, that\u2019s absolutely right [ph].", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich", "Okay. And so, the next question would be, if you were looking at who\u2019s driving us the scales, do you have a sense that this is more construction or it\u2019s actually maybe more commercial? And where I\u2019m getting to is are we starting to see that secular recovery of volume in the container, the commercial it\u2019s somewhere out here in the next quarter or two starts converting into that operating leverage from service intervals.", "David Steiner", "No, I think that\u2019s right. I think if you ask our folks on the field, they\u2019ll tell you that special waste and C&D are where they see this real strength in the pipeline. Obviously MSW has been strength now from many quarters in a row. But I think what they\u2019ll tell you out there, very optimistic is about special waste and \u2013 about special waste and C&D.", "You know, I mean, look, the reality is that you had a lot of pent up demand felt [ph] particularly in the Northeastern and Midwest, you had a lot of pent up demand built up during the winter, and you see a little bit of that. But we also think that we\u2019re seeing a secular pickup obviously in the construction industry.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich", "Okay. On the free cash flow \u2013 and I appreciate that you\u2019re being clear that you can add or subtract the asset sale number that do to calculation. But on a \u2013 if I look at it on a cash from up less [ph] capital spending approach, what does it take for this business to do $1.5 billion on those metrics? And \u2013 because asset sales come and go, where is the leverage without getting help from volume? This is you running the business better, how \u2013 where do \u2013 where do we see that? Where should we look for that as we progress? And how quickly could you get it?", "Jim Fish", "Boy, how quickly can we get it? I don\u2019t know. I think we\u2019re making pretty good progress here. If you exclude \u2013 what you\u2019re excluding that divestures piece which we look at that as well. And then you \u2013 then you get to the progress we\u2019re making on working capital. David, and I both have kind of have touched on that today. And we still have some room there, Michael, be or so improved by really only a day, and DPO [ph] by five days.", "So fairly pleased with the improvement of DPO [ph], but not necessarily pleased with the improvement of DSO. And both of them still have room for improvement. So I would argue that that\u2019s an area for continued improvements. The EBITDA \u2013 $49 million in EBITDA, and growth there is strong in light of kind of before we faced [ph] in the winter season. Our woody [ph] business did a nice job of offsetting the weather impact in our core business. But our core business still grew which I think is an important thing to mention.", "Our core business grew, and we had \u2013 look, we have some challenges, and we didn\u2019t \u2013 we didn\u2019t mention it in our scripts because we just don\u2019t want to blame anything on the weather. But we felt pretty darn good about the growth in EBITDA when at the same time we were shut down in Houston for a couple of days, we were shut down at Atlanta I think for four days in a quarter.", "So that clearly was some impact on the operation. But it does speak to a couple of things, and that is \u2013 that\u2019s Jim Trevathan and his team did a nice job of pulling some cost out when we knew we were going to be shut down.", "So I think back to your original question though, hard to say when exactly we will get to a number in the 15 range excluding divestitures. But I sure think we\u2019re on the right path with our cost control program, with our yield program and then continued work on CapEx discipline and working capital.", "David Steiner", "Hey, Michael look, just to add to that, from a sustained $1.5 billion point of view and you said, talk about it without volume. The reality is you can\u2019t get there without volume, right? I mean, look, we can \u2013 we said that a million times, we\u2019ve said once which is you can\u2019t get margin expansion unless you get 2% yield, right?", "And so, if you don\u2019t get the yields, you have no chance in getting there. You can\u2019t get there on cost alone, right? So you got to get above 2% yield or else you have not shot at getting there. So we\u2019ve done that. We\u2019ve driven our yield up to 2.6%. You know, if we \u2013 if we got back the money the money that we lost from the lose volumes which is mostly intentionally lost volumes, we\u2019re there, right?", "And so, I would tell you that from a sustained long-term point of view, $1.5 billion happens when we see our commercial volumes turn back to flat, when we stop seeing the leakage of cash from lost volumes. Now look, you can\u2019t have \u2013 I think you need it too [ph]. So you can\u2019t \u2013 right now like I keep saying, in this fix volume environment, you can\u2019t have both. You can\u2019t have both 2.6% yield and 2.6% volume. We did that \u2013 remember we did that in 2012, we had positive volumes and 1% price. We all saw what that got us. That doesn\u2019t get you $1.5 billion in free cash. It doesn\u2019t get you margin expansion.", "So what I would tell you, Michael is you can\u2019t look at this without volumes, you got to look at it as the right mix of price and volumes. And until we see that commercial pie start to grow so that we can get back to flat volumes, you\u2019re going to see us generate somewhere between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion. Once we get \u2013 once you see those volumes starting to turn, that\u2019s when you get $1.5 billion plus.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich", "Okay. So to that end, on the landfill side of your business, do you feel good about the nature of the pricing that you\u2019re instilling discipline in that commercial collection market by the private guy as supposed to subsidizing their ability to approach you [ph]?", "David Steiner", "Yes, look, again, you\u2019ve heard me talked about that a million times. That\u2019s absolutely critical to the long-term strategy. And yes, I feel \u2013 I actually feel very good about that.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich", "And do it about it in the sense [ph] that the market is starting to follow as well as supposed to you \u2013", "David Steiner", "No, look, again, we \u2013 look, we don\u2019t pay attention to what the market does frankly because what the market does is not going to influence what we do. We are going to do what we do because we \u2013 because look, I\u2019ve been here 10 years and I\u2019ve seen it both ways. I\u2019ve seen us play the volume game and I\u2019ve seen us play the price game. And there\u2019s only one way that we can grow the bottom line and that is by playing the price game.", "So I\u2019m encouraged by it because we go through a monthly and a quarterly review with each of the folks that re managing those businesses, and we have started to ask them tell us about your top 10 customers and what are we doing with price. And so, we\u2019re seeing what we\u2019re doing out in the field. And so, I\u2019m encouraged because we\u2019re sitting down with those folks and actually seeing the results.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich", "Okay. Thank you very much for taking my questions.", "David Steiner", "Thank you, Michael.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Derek Sbrogna of Macquarie.", "Derek Sbrogna \u2013 Macquarie", "Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question.", "David Steiner", "Good morning.", "Derek Sbrogna \u2013 Macquarie", "It was just \u2013 it was great to see the yield in your collection and transfer business continue moving higher. I\u2019m wondering if you could talk as you guys have a little bit in the past about some of the things you\u2019re doing to retain the volumes without lowering price. And then if you can maybe kind of assess how successful you think some of these programs have been?", "David Steiner", "Yes, it\u2019s a great question. And frankly, it\u2019s where the bulk of our focus is right now because the reality is that most customers whether it\u2019s solid waste or cable or telephone or water service or electricity, most customers don\u2019t switch just because you put a 3% price increase on them. They understand that everybody has to get price increases to see their \u2013 because their cost base goes up. And so, they get it.", "So they don\u2019t leave you because you raise the price. But if you raise the price and then have a service issue, that\u2019s when they leave you, right? So if your cable repeatedly goes out, that\u2019s when you start going and looking for another provider.", "And so, we need to be 100% focused on providing that best service to our customer and not give them a reason to leave. We\u2019ve done the studies, everyone says, well, your leave you over price, we\u2019ve done the study. They don\u2019t leave you over price. That is not the number one reason they leave you. The number one reason they leave you is leave you with service issues.", "And so, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve dedicated a lot of human capital and a lot of technology to making sure that we can have the best service. And so we were glad to see that as we went through the pricing progress in 2013, our churn rate did pick up. We were glad to see that in the first quarter of 2014, the churn rate actually moderated and was down sequentially from the fourth quarter so we\u2019re encouraged by that. But look, we still have a long way to go.", "Derek Sbrogna \u2013 Macquarie", "Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And just one more if I can. With the stronger free cash flow it doesn\u2019t look like you guys bought back any shares in Q1 but instituted the $600 million buyback last quarter, can you talk about your appetite for buy backs here given the stronger free cash flow?", "Jim Fish", "Yeah, you\u2019re right. We didn\u2019t buy back any shares in Q1 but I would expect to see us back in the market buying shares sometime in Q2.", "Derek Sbrogna \u2013 Macquarie", "Okay. And can you just remind us, there has been some talk about extending the bonus appreciation. Can you just remind us on what that headwind is and what that can potentially add to free cash flow if that is reversed in 2014?", "Jim Fish", "So we estimated it about $70 million to $80 million was the headwind. So obviously, if that law changes, if we get the extenders then we would see that reversed. But for now, we\u2019re expecting to see about $70 million to $80 million of headwind as a result of no-bonus appreciation.", "Derek Sbrogna \u2013 Macquarie", "Yeah, understood. Nice job. Congratulations.", "Jim Fish", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk [ph] of Wedbush [ph].", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush", "Good morning.", "David Steiner", "Good morning, Al [ph].", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush", "Just to follow, David, on a lot of the price-to-volume discussion, if you\u2019re prepared to continue the dial [ph] on the price and implement that, what expectations should you have for investors in terms of the volume comp, in terms of \u2013 are you getting to a point where you\u2019re going to annualize that and therefore volume declines will be getting closer to flat or should we start to still see some of these, the numbers that you\u2019re posting down 2%, 3%?", "David Steiner", "Yeah, well, that\u2019s a great question, Al [?], and it goes back to one of the things I said in the script which \u2013 if fundamental to our strategy, which is, we aren\u2019t looking for the most volume. We are not the company that you\u2019re going to \u2013 if you want the company that\u2019s getting the most volume, you need to look somewhere else. We\u2019re going to be the company that gets the best volume, right, the best volume mix that can get us the highest income from operations dollars and margins.", "And so, I would certainly expect to see as the economy continues to improve, I would certainly expect to see those volumes get better. Now, having said that, remember, in the second quarter as Jim mentioned, we lost a couple of resi contract that folks bid at prices that we weren\u2019t willing to go to. And then, we have our largest national account that quite frankly was a low single-digit margin and someone came in and undercut the price on that even though ours was low-single digit and we weren\u2019t going to go there. We said \u2013 look, we\u2019d rather not have the work than have the volumes. Oh, we lose that volume starting April 1 so you\u2019ll see a little bit tougher comp in the second quarter.", "The good news is we lost that volume, it came with virtually no earnings. And so, we\u2019ll take that tradeoff every day. We now can redeploy those trucks to going out and getting a higher margin business which from an earnings point of view will be accretive to us. And so, look, that\u2019s our deal, is that when we lose volumes \u2013 and I\u2019m not telling you we\u2019re 100% perfect because we\u2019re not perfect by any stretch. But the intention is that when we lose volumes we want to lose those volumes that are lower margin and then take those assets that we freed up and go allocate those to higher margin business. That\u2019s how you get the best volumes rather than get [?] to the most volume.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush", "Right. Your competition is telling us you are 100% perfect, so I\u2019ll have to correct them on that, okay.", "David Steiner", "Well, I wish we were but we\u2019ve got a long way to go.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush", "All right. Fine. Okay.", "David Steiner", "See, what I would tell you, Al, is my folks out in the field are perfect. I\u2019m nowhere near.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush", "Okay. That\u2019s probably what they were saying, sorry. Fair enough. I appreciate the color. What about, I mean, maybe you don\u2019t want to share this given the nature of the call but where are you seeing \u2013 I won\u2019t say the perfect volume or the incremental dollar volume that you want to get but where are you focusing or where are we looking for the incremental volume to come from? Even if on a [indiscernible] basis you\u2019re down as a company.", "David Steiner", "Right. Again, you\u2019ve got to sort of look at it by line of business. And what I would tell you is that on the landfill side, we\u2019re very comfortable with where we are, right. On the collection side, again, on the residential side, we all know what\u2019s going on there. It\u2019s a lot of capital that you\u2019ve got to invest and so we have to look at that purely from a return on capital point of view. And so we\u2019re not going to bid contracts that are low return on capital. But we\u2019ve certainly want to retain the contracts that we have. On the industrial side, I would tell you that generally we\u2019re going to get better margins on permanent roll offs than we\u2019re going to get on temporary roll offs and we\u2019ll allocate dollars there.", "On the commercial side, look, there\u2019s a lot of volume to be had if you want to go after these large school districts for example. But we\u2019ve had very little school district business because we see competitors coming in at a $1 to $1.50 a yard and we\u2019re just not going to go there. And so, what I would tell you is that we know where the higher margin customers are and that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to fish. We\u2019re not going to go fish just to put our cans out. We\u2019re not going to go take a school district at $1 a yard.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush", "Okay.", "Jim Fish", "I\u2019ll have one quick, one addition there is that when you think about volume that we like, our energy services volume is volume that we like. It\u2019s been a good growth story for us. March was the strongest month from a revenue standpoint and from a margin standpoint, but particularly from a revenue standpoint that we\u2019ve ever had. We were up 25% year-over-year for the quarter even with a little bit of weather impact there. I mean, it was awfully cold in North Dakota and still with that we saw a 25% top line growth in that business. It\u2019s good business for us.", "In addition, I think the \u2013 we expect that EPA at some point will promulgate coal ash disposal standards and we\u2019re well-positioned there to help that industry manage its coal combustion byproducts. So that will be good business for us as well.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush", "Right. Just \u2013 thanks for that color, Jim. To clarify though, where are those businesses being reported by line of business or \u2013?", "Jim Fish", "Yeah, are you talking about energy services, that all flows just through our core business.", "David Steiner", "And through the industrial line on the collection side, generally \u2013", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush", "Yeah, okay.", "David Steiner", "\u2013 through the special waste line on the landfill side.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush", "All right. Can you \u2013 you brought up a good point about coal ash. Can you just give us an update on what\u2019s your expectations are there on regulation and when do you expect to hear?", "David Steiner", "Yeah, I believe the EPA has a court order to issue something by the end of the year. So we would expect that because we\u2019re well positioned, we would expect that sometime in kind of the 15, 16 period we\u2019ll start to see this materially move the needle.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush", "So is that the relationship with utility customers and because of landfill and the expectation that this will be Subtitle D disposal or Subtitle C?", "David Steiner", "Yeah, I don\u2019t think anybody believes it will be Subtitle C but there\u2019s a number of things that they\u2019re looking for including beneficial reuse, including management of their own landfills as a number of them have landfills. We can help them manage their landfills. And then, of course, if they care to take it offsite we can obviously handle that as well.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush", "All right. Okay. Thanks. Finally, one question here. Your asset sale on the JV in China I think would maybe prompt the question on international and, David what\u2019s the plan here in terms of maybe growth or a refocused organization in terms of outside of North America.", "David Steiner", "Yeah, and look, I think you hit the nail on the head. The word would be refocused, right, I mean, look, when we went to China, we had a spectacular partner there, Shanghai Chang Pal [ph] the parent company and Shanghai Environmental Group, the subsidiary that we directly work with was a great partner. In fact, even though we took out our equity investment in China. We actually will continue working with them providing technical services. So we\u2019ll still provide them people over there.", "We just thought that it was a better use of our capital. The other thing about the Chinese market is that it\u2019s a fast-growing market but it\u2019s also a very competitive market, and we just thought that we could better redeploy the capital into our core business in the United States. Now, we still have a waste energy project being built in the United Kingdom, and we\u2019d expect to continue to see a growth in projects over there. But look, I think you hit the nail on the head. We\u2019re completely refocused is on our core solid waste business in North America and we were pretty pleased to see the improvement.", "Now we got some good benefit from Wheelabrator in the quarter. They had a spectacular quarter, but we all know that was drive by electricity prices that primarily by electricity prices that are going to moderate as the weather warms up. So we\u2019ll take that additional capital. We\u2019ll refocus on the core business and as Jim said we\u2019ll use that free cash flow to go off and buy some shares this year.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush", "Right, and just a follow up on that one. The cash that you get, are you allowed to repatriate that back here or as \u2013 need to be deployed?", "David Steiner", "Yes. Now, we repatriated the full $155 million back here.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush", "Thank you, guys.", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Corey Greendale of First Analysis.", "Corey Greendale \u2013 First Analysis", "Hi, good morning.", "Jim Fish", "Good morning, Corey.", "David Steiner", "Good morning.", "Corey Greendale \u2013 First Analysis", "I\u2019ll try to keep it really brief. I think you\u2019ve talked in the past about having \u2013 about your analytics behind your pricing. Can you just talk \u2013 and I realize there\u2019s difference by customer and market. But can you just talk about how close you are in the field to what you believe the optimum is based on your analytics?", "David Steiner", "Yeah, gosh, Corey, I would tell you, we\u2019re nowhere close to the optimum. I mean, we have so many customers that they are spread out fairly quickly. So I would say that if you look at it from a customer-by-customer basis, we\u2019re nowhere near the optimum. But if you look at sort of like the overall strategic implementation of the pricing plan is out in the field, our folks out in the field completely get it. Do we make mistakes? Look, we made plenty of bids where we thought we were going to earn x and we ended up earning y. So we\u2019re nowhere near perfect, but they all get what the strategy is and frankly they\u2019re doing a great job of implementing it.", "Corey Greendale \u2013 First Analysis", "So then, to follow up on Al\u2019s question about kind of that price-volume tradeoff, I assume the optimum is not on a company wide basis to have 10% yield and negative whatever it would be volume, how close to just \u2013 at a high level that we can see how close are we to what you think the optimum is where you would still be growing, maximizing operating income what would the price volume look like?", "David Steiner", "Yeah, again, in this current \u2013 if you look at a business environment that isn\u2019t growing, I would tell you that I think we\u2019re right about there, right? If we\u2019re going to see above 2% yield, it would be very difficult for us to have positive volumes. It\u2019s just the nature of that beast. And so, if you believe that there\u2019s not going to be any volume growth ever again, then I would tell you, we\u2019re pretty close to optimize.", "What we need to see in order to get to the optimization of the overall business is we need to see volume growth. And we\u2019re seeing that volume growth in the landfill, that\u2019s encouraging. We\u2019re starting to see that growth get a little bit better despite the first quarter I would say on the industrial side and then commercials stubbornly remains sort of stuck in that negative 3% to 5% range.", "Jim Fish", "Corey, I would add that as a matter of course, Jim Trevathan has monthly calls with all of the areas and we regularly look at income from operations by line of business. And so we are assessing whether we\u2019ve pushed too hard. We\u2019ll look at specific areas in a specific line of business within those areas and determine whether is income from operations declining in the phase of very heavy price increase and very heavy volume loss. And that to us would indicate that maybe we\u2019ve reached that kind of point of diminishing returns. But I would also add that we\u2019ve seen very few of those, I mean, I don\u2019t know exactly where we are but we\u2019ve seen very few of those, there\u2019s a couple of them but for the most part we still think we have room there to move ahead on price.", "David Steiner", "And, Jim, I would add, we have a couple that are in question but they\u2019re MSAs, they\u2019re not entire areas.", "Jim Fish", "Right.", "David Steiner", "They\u2019re not one of our 17 areas. It may be one MSA that we\u2019re taking a harder look at.", "Corey Greendale \u2013 First Analysis", "Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.", "David Steiner", "Certainly.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tony Bancroft of Gabelli & Company.", "Tony Bancroft \u2013 Gabelli & Company", "Hey, good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for getting my call. Just a quick question on \u2013 back to JV monetization. Now, are you planning on \u2013 I know you\u2019re saying you\u2019re looking \u2013 you\u2019re getting out China but is there \u2013 if there is a potential opportunity over there that looks good, would you potentially go back in to \u2013 to try to grow more in China or what\u2019s your sort of long-term outlook with that?", "David Steiner", "Yeah, I think everybody has seen sort of a little bit of a moderation in what\u2019s going on in China from a growth perspective, right? I mean, three years ago, China was sort of the dot com of its time. It was growing so fast and obviously we\u2019ve all seen that growth moderate over the last few years. But it\u2019s a great point. It\u2019s one of the reasons why I\u2019m glad of two things. One, that we still have a great relationship with our joint venture partner. And two, we\u2019re going to be continuing to provide them service over there because that will give us not as big a toehold as we have when we were helping them build plants but it\u2019ll still give us a little bit of toehold over there so that if there is an opportunity, we\u2019ll be able to spot it.", "Now, I would tell you, I don\u2019t see any of that on the near-term horizon but with China being such a large part of the world economy, I think it would be foolish to say \u2013 we never want to go back to China, and I\u2019m actually glad that we\u2019re maintaining the relationship with our partner over there.", "Tony Bancroft \u2013 Gabelli & Company", "Yeah, thank you. And then just to sort of jump back to some prior questions about long-term growth in lines of businesses. In five years, where is sort of the next focus, not so much on your organic operations in trying to fine tune those but, I mean, you mentioned about energy waste doing so well. You\u2019re a huge asset owner in most of the basin. Do you have any thoughts on that and I know we\u2019ve talked about it before but maybe there\u2019s been quite a bit of growth recently. Is there anymore focus on that?", "David Steiner", "Yeah, I think that clearly energy service, this area where we have some longer term visibility and I wouldn\u2019t say that about maybe the overall macroeconomic climate. I couldn\u2019t tell you what the economy is going to do in the US and the rest of North America past 2015. But energy services sure looks like that as a growth engine not only for the economy but for us specifically for the next 5 to 10 years. So we think energy services and environmental services are two of those growth areas that you\u2019ve asked [ph] about.", "Jim Fish", "And then to dovetail on to that, look, the energy services is all about fracing and energy, that low natural \u2013 and natural gas pricing. That low natural gas pricing as you can see is going to drive billions of dollars of infrastructure investment in the chemical corridors and in other areas. And so it\u2019s going to generate a tremendous amount of M&I, manufacturing and industrial activity. And so we certainly think that when you look at the energy services, not only do you see the growth there but you see the adjacent growth as people try to take advantage of low energy pricing.", "Tony Bancroft \u2013 Gabelli & Company", "Got it. Thank you. And, I guess, just, I\u2019ve got to ask you. If that business grew large enough, is there something that you want to sort of maybe sort of expose [ph] on your quarterly reporting or maybe do something more like spin-off or is there anymore \u2013 is there any strategic thoughts about that.", "David Steiner", "Yeah, well, we generally don\u2019t look at that until it reaches 10% of our revenue. So I would love to be able to report it. If it\u2019s a good business, high margin, my guess is that you\u2019re going to see great growth but you won\u2019t see that kind of growth where we\u2019d say \u2013 okay, let\u2019s go split it off separately.", "Tony Bancroft \u2013 Gabelli & Company", "Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you so much.", "David Steiner", "Certainly.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Barbra Alborene [ph] of Morningstar.", "Barbra Alborene \u2013 Morningstar", "Good morning everybody.", "Jim Fish", "Good morning.", "David Steiner", "Good morning.", "Barbra Alborene \u2013 Morningstar", "Regarding recycling, I know that you\u2019ve mentioned this little meta site [ph]. Have you been successful in charging customers penalties, well, I suppose [indiscernible] a very customer friendly terms so maybe I\u2019ll rephrase that. Have you been successful at increasing fees for contaminated recyclables or is this more a matter of educating customer still to give you less of them at the get-go?", "David Steiner", "Yeah, it\u2019s a combination of both. We\u2019ve done just that and not all of our contracts allow us to do that, but where we\u2019ve been allowed contractually to do that, we\u2019ve done just that. But long term, you\u2019ve hit the nail on the head, long term, it is an education. We\u2019re all better off if the consumer knows how to separate it so that we don\u2019t have the contamination to begin with. The consumer doesn\u2019t want to be penalized or the customer doesn\u2019t want to be penalized for contaminated loads and we certainly don\u2019t want to have those higher operating costs from contaminated loads. So the short-term solution is to say we\u2019re going to charge you. The long-term solution is to educate the consumers and our customers.", "Jim Fish", "Barbara [ph] I might add that as Dave mentioned, not all of our contracts allow for that charge for contamination, but as renew contracts, we are absolutely adding it to contracts that we\u2019re protected and also the customer is protected and know what to expect from our charges.", "Barbra Alborene \u2013 Morningstar", "Got you. Would you be willing to share a percentage? How many of these contracts have from renewal actually accept the terms that allow for a surcharge or fee on these contaminants?", "David Steiner", "Well, I can tell you 100% are the ones that we renew.", "Barbra Alborene \u2013 Morningstar", "That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks. Okay.", "David Steiner", "But I think we\u2019d all be guessing if we told you what percentage have not allowed \u2013 look, I\u2019d be shocked and you can follow up with that and he\u2019ll follow up with our recycling folks. But I would be shocked if a large customer did not allow some level of contamination clause into the contract.", "Barbra Alborene \u2013 Morningstar", "Got it. Got it. Jim, as you work with your field teams to help them educate customers, are customers getting it or is this still a challenge that you guys are working through? I would imagine that in some cases, in some larger \u2013 even some smaller customers are just not really that quick on the uptake. So what do you do with your field team to help move that process along?", "David Steiner", "Yeah, look, again, the customer in this instant ranges from a sort of a small customer with a small business to a large national account to large municipalities. So all customers are different, but, look, the large customers that make up the bulk of the fiber market absolutely get it. They understand, look, they see what\u2019s going on with demand on China. They see what\u2019s going on with commodity prices. And more importantly, they see what\u2019s going on with investment in recycling and infrastructure, right. I mean, we\u2019re not investing in recycling and infrastructure and as far as we know nobody is making big investments in new recycling infrastructure.", "So they understand that if you\u2019re a large city or if you\u2019re a large national account, you\u2019ve got to make this a long-term sustainable business model in order to drive the investment so that you can drive more recycling. And I think they absolutely understand that. Like anything though, markets don\u2019t turn on a time, right, so it\u2019s going to take some time for that to seep through the market and see sort of a long-term systemic change in the way folks do business in recycling.", "Barbra Alborene \u2013 Morningstar", "All right, sounds good. Thanks very much.", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "Operator", "I will now return the call back over to Mr. David Steiner for closing remarks.", "David Steiner", "Well, thank you all for joining us. We certainly want to thank all of our field employees who did a phenomenal job working through a challenging first quarter. I\u2019m sure they all like we welcome the seasonal turn, the warmer weather throughout the United States and we look forward to talking to you all in our second quarter conference call.", "Operator", "Thank you for participating in today\u2019s Waste Management conference call.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of Waste Management is prohibited.", "Now, I will turn the call over to Waste Management\u2019s President and CEO, David Steiner.", "David Steiner", "Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. We had a very good quarter, and we\u2019ll talk in detail about our results, but first I wanted to discuss the news in today\u2019s press release announcing that we have signed a definitive agreement to sell our Wheelabrator waste-to-energy business to Energy Capital Partners for $1.94 billion. As we have said before, our waste-to-energy business has two distinct components. The tip fees that we receive on the front-end, and the payments for energy on the back. We did not view the energy payments as strategic and we do not have the depth of energy expertise that Energy Capital Partners has.", "Consequently we have entered into a waste supply agreement from the front-end, where we will use our expertise to fill up the plants for seven years just like we do today. But we will no longer have the volatility of the financial results related to Wheelabrator electricity sale. We use the proceeds from the sale in a way that is most accretive to earnings and creates the most shareholder value. We\u2019ll do so by buying back shares, or doing acquisitions in our core business if they\u2019re more accretive and to create long-term shareholder value. We\u2019ll do all of this while maintaining our strong balance sheet.", "Wheelabrator is a high performing organization that reflects the quality of the people, our friends and colleagues that operate it. I want to thank Mark Weidman and the entire Wheelabrator team for their hard work and dedication. They made our waste-to-energy business successful and we anticipate that the business will continue to be successful under Mark\u2019s leadership and ECP\u2019s ownership.", "Returning to second quarter results, the solid performance that we saw on the first quarter continued throughout the second quarter. Once again our yield and cost control programs drove growth in both our income from operations and operating EBITDA and led to expanded margins in our traditional solid waste business and our overall business.", "In the second quarter, we earned $0.60 per share, an increase of over 10% when compared to the second quarter of 2013. In addition we saw nice improvement in net cash provided by operations and free cash flow. Through the first six months of 2014 our employees have executed on our business plans and we\u2019re encouraged by the strong results. We expect that this performance will continue throughout the remainder of the year.", "Our yield program continues to be a significant driver of our margin expansion. For the second quarter, our collection and disposal yield was 2.3% which is the fifth consecutive quarter of yield above 2%, it is down slightly from our Q1 yield primarily due to increased revenue and the anniversary of the implementation of our regulatory cost recovery fee in 2013.", "Our core pricing remains very strong at 3.9%, a year-over-year improvement of 10 basis points. Each of our lines of business had positive yield with the exception of landfill C&D. In the landfill MSW line same-store average rates increased 5.1% and through the second quarter nearly 90% of our contracted third-party landfill customers have received a price increase. The remaining landfill customers either perform event work or have restrictions that limit price increase opportunities.", "When compared to the second quarter of 2013 same-store average rates in both the commercials and industrial lines increased 4.4%, and we saw a 3.1% increase in our residential line. This has had some effect on volumes particularly with regard to national accounts and residential contracts but we continue to see the trademark as positive as the operating margin in our traditional solid waste business was up 50 basis points.", "Turning to volumes, in the second quarter volumes were a negative 1.4% which is an improvement of 40 basis points from the first quarter. More than 50% of our volume decline came from several low margin, but large national account losses. In the second quarter we saw a positive landfill and transportation volumes more than offset by declines in the collection lines of business. Despite negative volumes overall income from operations grew more than 9% and our income from operations margin grew 120 basis points.", "In addition operating EBITDA increased more than 5% and operating EBITDA margins increased 120 basis points to 25.6%. When we issued volume patterns at the beginning of the year, we expected volumes to be around a negative 1% for 2014. Through the first six months volumes have declined 1.6% and we now expect that to be about the run rate for the remainder of the year, with the change being primarily attributable to the continuing impact of lost national account business.", "Our recycling operations also performed better in the quarter, adding almost $0.01 in earnings per share compared to the second quarter of 2013, despite a 2.1% decline in average commodity prices. The efforts that we have put in place to improve our enforcement on contaminated loads and modify the methods for calculating rebates to customers are paying off. Operating cost in the recycling line of business improved almost 8%, primarily due to lower rebates and reduced labor costs.", "Turning to our waste-to-energy business, in the second quarter operating results were essentially flat when compared to 2013. We did not change our full year EPS or free cash flow guidance as a result of the proposed sale of Wheelabrator. But if the deal closes before the end of the year, it could have a minor impact on earnings and cash. On average our waste-to-energy operations would produce about $0.015 of earnings and $10 million in free cash flow per month.", "We expect that this transaction will close sometime in the last two months of the year, in which case the effect on this year\u2019s earnings and free cash flow would be minimal. Our solid first half performance on yield and cost controls makes us confident that we can meet or exceed our full year earnings growth goals. But first and foremost our Company operates to generate cash flow and when we combine our yield and cost focus with our focus on capital discipline and working capital we expect to see strong cash flow in the second half of 2014. Consequently we expect to meet or exceed the 1.5 billion high-end of our free cash flow guidance.", "I\u2019m now going to turn the call over to Jim to discuss our second quarter results and the sale of Wheelabrator in more detail.", "Jim Fish", "Thank you, David. Before discussing the details of our second quarter results I want to provide some additional information on the sale of our Wheelabrator business. After normal transaction adjustments to the sales price, we anticipate receiving about $1.85 billion in cash once the transaction is finalized late this year. With our basis in Wheelabrator we will pay no taxes on the transaction and it should generate a capital loss of approximately $300 million that we can utilize over the next five years.", "Our base Wheelabrator divestiture model assumed a partial use of proceeds to maintain leverage neutrality with the majority of the proceeds going to share repurchases. The diluted EPS accretion in that model is about $0.02 per share for 2015. Of course, we will look for reasonably priced core businesses to replace the $220 million of Wheelabrator EBITDA, if they are accretive to the base model. In either case, we would selectively retire debt to the extent necessary to maintain our strong balance sheet and our target leverage ratio of about three times EBITDA.", "On the share repurchase front, we\u2019d anticipate it that we would in the market repurchasing our shares in the first half of 2014. However, we suspended share repurchases while the Wheelabrator transaction was pending. Now that we\u2019ve announced the transaction we have entered into an accelerated share repurchase program to spend the full amount of our previously announced $600 million authorization on share repurchases. We will fund the $600 million on August 1st, and we\u2019ll see an initial delivery of approximately 9.6 million shares representing 70% of the shares expected to be retired. The actual number of shares repurchased will depend upon the volume weighted average price of our stock, less a discount during the repurchase period which we expect to be three to six months.", "Turning to our second quarter results. Our revenue grew 1% to $3.56 billion. Strong yield and acquisition revenue were the main drivers with volume declines and a negative foreign currency translation muting revenue growth. The foreign exchange impact on revenue was approximately $14 million. We continue to see improvement in all our cost lines. Operating cost as a percent of revenue improved 90 basis points to 64.6% and improved $10 million in the second quarter. Reduced cost at our recycling facilities and the sale of an asset improved the cost of operations, $41 million, and we were partially offset by increased cost related to recently acquired businesses. SG&A costs were flat when compared to the second quarter of 2013, at $353 million and improved as a percent of revenue by 10 basis points to 9.9%. We are still on target to achieve our full year SG&A goals.", "Turning to cash flow, for the second quarter we generated $447 million of free cash flow, an increase of $100 million when compared to 2013. We accomplished this by growing our net cash provided by operating activities, $10 million to $555 million, by improving working capital and by maintaining discipline on capital spending. The growth and net cash provided by operating activities was muted by an increase of over $70 million in cash taxes primarily related to the repatriation of accumulated cash from Puerto Rico operations and the expiration of the bonus depreciation allowance.", "Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $208 million, a decrease of $27 million from the second quarter of 2013. We also divested our Puerto Rico operations and other assets in the quarter, for about $100 million. Year-to-date 2014, we\u2019ve generated $931 million in total free cash flow and $665 million excluding divestiture proceeds. This is the highest free cash flow we have ever generated through the first six months of the year, puts us on-track to meet or exceed the upper-end of our full year free cash flow goal of between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, despite a planned to pickup in capital expense, in the second half of 2014.", "Looking at internal revenue growth for the total company, in the second quarter our collection and disposal yield was 2.3% with volumes declining 1.4%. This led to income from operations growing $48 million, operating income margin growing 120 basis points, operating EBITDA growing $48 million, and operating EBITDA margin growing 120 basis points. Our collection line of business continues to see the benefit of the yield volume trade-off. Both our commercial and industrial yields were 4.2%m while residential was 1.6%. Overall collection yield was 3.2% with volumes declining 4.1%. This led to income from operations growing $7 million and margin expanding 10 basis points. The industrial line of business drove the growth in income from operations, but that growth was muted by continued declines in the residential line where we lost two profitable franchised contracts.", "In the landfill line of business for the second quarter, we saw the benefits of both positive volume and positive yield, just as we did in the first quarter. Total landfill volume increased 3.9%. Combined special waste and revenue generating cover volumes were positive 2.1%, MSW volumes grew by 4.4% and C&D volume grew 11.5%. MSW yield rose 2%. This led to income from operations growing $9 million which is the fifth consecutive quarter of growth and margins grew 20 basis points.", "Finally looking at our other financial metrics, at the end of the second quarter our weighted average cost to debt was 4.79% and the floating rate portion of our total debt was 12% at the end of the quarter. Our income tax rate in the quarter was 44.7% primarily because foreign cash accumulated in Puerto Rico was repatriated to United States upon divestiture of the operations. For the next two quarters we expect our tax rate to be approximately 35%.", "We\u2019re encouraged by the results for the first six months of the year which put us on-track to meet our full year targets. The strong momentum in our pricing and cost controls sets us up nicely for the second half of 2014 and positions us for continued success into 2015 as we look to redeploy the proceeds from the sale of Wheelabrator. I would be remised if I do not thank our employees for their hard work, because of them 2014 has been successful so far and we\u2019re looking forward to continued improvement with their help. I would particularly like to thank the employees of Wheelabrator. They have been valuable teammates. We take pride in running a great and safe business. I know they will continue that success under the ownership of ECP.", "And Jenisha with that we\u2019ll open the line up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Scott Levine of Imperial Capital.", "Scott Levine - Imperial Capital", "", "Congratulations on the quarter and the sale of Wheelabrator there and I guess my first question here is in the press release announcing the sale you mentioned the fact that there are some targets out there that you\u2019re interested in. And that there is a good sized pipeline, we haven\u2019t seen a lot of larger acquisitions with the exception of RCI, out of you guys recently but a little bit more color on what you see out there and additional thoughts with regards to the timing at which point you might look at deploying capital for buybacks versus M&A a bit more color on your investment plans and do you see them for the proceeds after the deal closes?", "David Steiner", "Scott generally what we\u2019re looking at is as you can well imagine are sort of those smaller tuck-in acquisitions. And obviously you\u2019ve got to in order to spend the kind of money that we\u2019re selling this Wheelabrator business for, we\u2019re going to have to put together quite a lot of those. So it will take time if we\u2019re going to replace that EBITDA. As we\u2019ve said to the extent we can\u2019t do that we would buy back shares. The whole theory of the transaction was that we didn\u2019t want to do a deal that wasn\u2019t going to be accretive to earnings and so we used this base case of 100% of proceeds going to debt pay down and share repurchase as our base case. The good news is that that\u2019s accretive and to the extent that we can buy businesses to tuck them in that would replace the EBITDA that\u2019s a net positive for us. So we\u2019ll be looking at that over the next few months as we move toward a closing and then I will expect Scott that once we do close it at the end of the third quarter mid fourth quarter we\u2019d have a much better defined plan as to how much of those proceeds we can actually deploy into new businesses.", "Scott Levine - Imperial Capital", "And then as my follow-up, I think Jim had mentioned that you\u2019d lost a couple of profitable franchised contracts during the quarter. Maybe a little bit more color regarding the competitive landscape and your commitment to pricing, I am assuming that continues. But is the environment becoming more or less competitive a bit more color on the operating environment and pricing there?", "Jim Fish", "", "Look the residential line of business is always very competitive because they are large contracts, sort of just like the national accounts. I would characterize the pricing environment as fairly stable. Look there is really only two things that we can look at to determine the pricing environments and that is the discussions with our local managers and publicly reported statistics. And I don\u2019t think there is any doubt that in the last 12 months to 18 months we\u2019ve seen some of our larger competitors favor volume over price. That\u2019s not something that we traditionally have done and obviously that has cost us volume. But overall I\u2019d say that when you look at all the competition out there that it\u2019s fairly stable.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Derek Sbrogna of Macquarie Capital.", "Derek Sbrogna - Macquarie Capital", "", "So maybe one first on the core, the landfill pricing, I missed on your landfill pricing you mentioned of positive 5.1%. Does that include any of those contracts which are linked to CPI and maybe give us a sense I know you guys have talked about on the overall business about 40% of the contracts being linked to CPI. But maybe give us a sense of what that is on the landfill side, just to get an understanding of how much of that business is versus competitive markets versus what\u2019s linked to CPI?", "David Steiner", "Yes, when we look at landfill contracts, there is really two things. It\u2019s not just CPI. There is also, a lot of those contracts will have just a standard price increase in it. So just to use an example, it might be a $30 contract, and it goes up to $32 the following year, 34. So it won\u2019t have a specific CPI related, but it will have a specific price increase. So a large portion of our contracts would have those types of price escalators in them and what we have said is that we are going to look at those contracts as they renew, and we are going to get higher price increases and then to the extent that we have volume that we can raise price on. Immediately we\u2019re going to look for 5% to 7% price increases. We\u2019re really just started to turn all of our focus to the landfill pricing over the last six months. I would tell you that we are sort of in the second or third inning on that project, there\u2019s still a long way to go.", "Derek Sbrogna - Macquarie Capital", "Got it, that was helpful. And then maybe one on Wheelabrator, this as we have talked about it over the last couple of years about potential sale. Can you maybe talk about the timing, I mean why now and have you been in negotiations for a while for sale of this asset and maybe just a little more color around that please?", "Jim Fish", "Look as you know, there has been rumors out there for probably two years that we have been looking at the sale of Wheelabrator. But it needed to be the right partner for us. We feel like we found the right partner. It needed to be the right waste supply agreements for us and we feel like we\u2019ve crafted a good supply agreement with ECP. So it was not so much around, when the timing was, but when we could get the various features of the agreement together, that satisfies both us and our -- and the partner that we are selling to.", "David Steiner", "And I would tell you that Jim led the negotiations for the transaction. And from Jim\u2019s point of view, I can promise you that he thought the negotiations lasted a very long time because he spent a good portion of his time literally over the last six months getting this deal done.", "Jim Fish", "My wife\u2019s point of view as well.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank.", "Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks, pretty close. It\u2019s Amit Mehrotra here from Deutsche Bank. Congrats guys, you had a nice quarter and congrats on the announcement as well. First question is on pricing. Could you just comment on maybe in terms of what inning you guys are in with respect to pricing growth, and if we look out this time next year we will be talking about the ninth straight quarter of 2% plus yield and just as a follow-up to that. What level is the company willing to see, volume comps get more negative to get to the same level of price and mix growth?", "David Steiner", "Yes. When we look at the price volume trade-off, I will tell you that that I would expect that next year you\u2019ll hear us say it\u2019s the ninth straight quarter of over 2%. Now as we talked about, you saw it go from 2.6 to 2.3. That\u2019s really more mathematical things than anything else. It\u2019s the anniversary and has some various fees. So it\u2019s not an indication that we\u2019re going backwards in pricing. It\u2019s really more just an indication of mathematics, but you should see that above 2% for the -- certainly the near future and I would expect well through 2015. When you think about the volume trade-off, you got to look at it in various lines of business right. When we look at it, we say what are those lines of business where we can get volumes without affecting the pricing dynamics in a market? And we are going to focus more on those volumes than we would on other volumes. And so we want to be a little bit more circumspect and how we manage our volumes. We think that going into 2015 we should see some easier comps and we should see the volume start to stabilize. And look, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve always said. That this model really starts churning once you can get both, yield over 2% and positive volumes. I would hope that in 2015 we can see that reality for the first time in many years.", "Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just a follow-up on the sale announcement, can you just update us on the cost plan that you guys have in place in terms of the 100 basis points reduction on a run rate basis by the end of \u201916. I\u2019m assuming that would need to be recalibrated given the divestiture and that impact on the sales level?", "Jim Fish", "Yes I think, if you think about the cost piece, what we are mostly talking about with Jim Trevathan and his team is on the core side of our business and that is ongoing, and we feel like we are making progress there as you saw in our results. It won\u2019t be affected in terms of absolute dollars. It could be affected in terms of basis points, just simply because of the smaller business here. But I think the main point is that when we look at cost control, whether it is on operating cost or SG&A, we feel like we\u2019re making very-very good progress, with still additional progress to go.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari of Credit Suisse.", "Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse", "Just a question on the supply agreement, could you give us a sense of how that supply agreement is structured with Energy Capital Partners? How long does it last for? And specifically what we\u2019re looking for is, does this impact your ability be strategic on disposal pricing given that waste-to-energy plants are like landfills in your disposal network? Any color there would be good. Thanks.", "David Steiner", "So Hamzah look the intent of the negotiation of the waste supply agreement was to replicate what Waste Management and we have in place today. And I think we\u2019ve done that, ECP\u2019s primary interest in the waste supply agreement was volume certainty and both sides worked hard to crack an agreement to provide that volume certainty. But it also allows us to optimize our operation. For example our landfills as you know are a critical piece of our business and we\u2019ll continue to bring tonnes in those landfills while at the same time fulfilling the volume commitment. And I don\u2019t know whether that answers your question specifically but I think we feel good about the fact that we have crafted a waste supply agreement that satisfies both parties, needs.", "Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse", "Okay. I can follow-up offline on that that is fine. And then on the volume loss, could you give us a sense of how much more low margin business do you have in your portfolio? It seems like over the last couple of years we\u2019ve been pruning that, now we have a pricing gate. Are we near the end of pruning of low margin business and we should expect the pricing gate to come off once that process is done? Any color on that, thanks.", "David Steiner", "Yes again Hamzah you\u2019ve got to look at it by line of business. I would say that on the commercial line our primary focus is going to be on maintaining the customers that we have, right. We\u2019ve said it many times that some customers will leave for price and those customers are going to leave, but everybody else you got to make sure that you have a high level of service to maintain them. So our core strategy on the commercial side would be to provide the best service and reduce the churn rate.", "On the roll-off side obviously as you see temporary roll-off improved throughout the country with residential and commercial construction going up, we would expect to get our fair share of volumes there. And so I would expect that we\u2019ll see the volumes on the roll-off side turn positive in 2015. And on the residential line we probably still have some residential contracts that are low margin contracts, you should see those start to be called out or re-priced throughout 2015. So it depends upon what line of business you\u2019re looking at and how we\u2019ll approach it that sort of talked about what we\u2019re going to do on each of the three collection lines.", "Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse", "And just last question I\u2019ll turn it over. Are there any other adjacencies that you would like to get into? It seems like there maybe a little bit of medical waste still in the portfolio but the rest of the adjacencies are gone, is energy services a bigger vertical that you want to get bigger in? Thanks.", "David Steiner", "Yes clearly we would look to get bigger in energy services it has been a good growth business for us. We\u2019d expect that growth to continue and we\u2019d like to get bigger there. On medical waste, I think it\u2019s been well documented that they\u2019re a very strong competitor that does a great job of keeping everybody out of that business. And so we\u2019d expect that business frankly to not be as much of a growth area as we thought it would be in the past. And so when we look at the growth areas we\u2019re really looking at our manufacturing and industrial business and our energy services business.", "Jim Fish", "", "Hamzah that energy services business continues to grow at a 25%, 30% cliff for us, it still is relatively small compared to the size of the overall business but certainly a nice growth engine.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey of Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs", "", "First on the pricing, thinking about the second half of \u201914 will there be any notable impact from the flow through of the CPI, as it sort of flows through pricing in the back half versus the first half of the year?", "David Steiner", "Yes the CPI will likely be a little bit lower in the back half of the year than it was in the front half of the year given the performance of CPI and the fact that a lot of our contracts reprise on July 1st. But again what we\u2019ve always said is if CPI is lower we just have to go out and get those pricing dollars from other places. And so we\u2019d expect that to continue in the back half of \u201914.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs", "", "Got it David and I am not sure if I missed any incremental comments you had on bonus depreciation, but our another competitor talked about the potential for it to be retroactively extended before the year-end. And I am curious if you have any thoughts around whether that potentially could happen? And if it does, what would be the impact on Waste Management\u2019s cash flows?", "Jim Fish", "It\u2019s hard to predict what the government is going to do I guess. But certainly could happen and we\u2019d be happy if it were extended. But the impact for us is substantial, it\u2019s probably close to $80 million a year, so it\u2019s substantial on part of when you look at cash flow from operations part of the headwind was the expiration of bonus depreciation for the quarter it was worth about $20 million.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Box of KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "", "Nice job on the recycling front, offsetting some commodity weakness, I think clearly a step in the right direction. Can you just give us a feel for if this is the beginning, and we should continue to expect lower rebates and lower labor expense, or if this is maybe more of a one-time true up and we should continue to see things kind of at this level?", "", "David Steiner", "", "Yes, I know. This is definitely the beginning and so you know it\u2019s a combination of things. It\u2019s continuing to manage our contracts and the rebate structure, it\u2019s continuing to look at our cost structure and driving costs out, and then it\u2019s also rationalizing the plants where we don\u2019t have volume. They have done a nice job in the first half of 2014. We would expect that to continue through the back half of 2014 and then as we have always said all along, this thing really starts to cook if we see the commodity prices turnaround. We\u2019re not forecasting that for the back half of the year, but we would expect to see continued benefit year-over-year from our recycling operations for Q3 and Q4.", "Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Market", "Understood. And then on the residential side, I think, David you mentioned potentially calling some contracts, or re-pricing those contracts, I\u2019m just curious of what\u2019s your sense on the competitive environment for the residential business and maybe the appetite for some of your smaller peers to be bigger in this business has that changed at all over the last couple of quarters?", "David Steiner", "I\u2019m not sure that has changed dramatically. Look, we\u2019re always going to be the higher priced provider in the residential line of business. I can give you a perfect example of sort of a service price dynamic. We had a contract that we lost in Pennsylvania. We lost it clearly on price. And the contract went away. And what the municipality found out is that that they had dramatic service issues with the new provider. They came back to us and then they said we need you to taking this contract back. We said, we will take it back but it\u2019s going to be at our price. And they said, that\u2019s perfect, and then we said, that\u2019s great, don\u2019t worry, we will handle it from here. So it just goes to show that when you look at residential business, service matters. And when we look at the residential line of business, we\u2019re not looking to win every bid. What we\u2019re looking to do is to renew our current contracts at that current or higher rate because of the service that we provide and the partnership that we have with our communities for many-many years.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Corey Greendale of First Analysis.", "", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "Just a couple of clarifying questions from the responses earlier, someone asked earlier about the 5.1% growth in MSW pricing. Is that including all of your MSW volumes, so that includes your long-term contractual stuff which suggests that you are pricing on the gate rate of significantly higher than 5.1%?", "Jim Fish", "", "That\u2019s right. That\u2019s exactly right.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "So can you just help us to -- a little bit so like what percent of the overall volume are you able to raise price at any given year and what is the increase at the gate rate?", "Jim Fish", "Yes. Given that those contracts are generally 3 to 5 years you are seeing sort of anywhere from 20% to 30% of the volume that we can affect. And now remember that 5.1%. I don\u2019t want you all to think that that\u2019s across the board 5.1%. There is some mix in there, right, because all that is doing, is taking a look at same-store sales, but there is absolutely no doubt. The folks sitting around this table are looking at landfill pricing every month and every quarter, and making sure that we are touching the customers that we can touch. As we mentioned we get 90% of our landfill customers in the first half of the year. The other 10%, it\u2019s not that we let them slide on pricing. It\u2019s that they are either event work or they have contracts that prevent us from doing it. And so we\u2019re going to take the same approach on landfill pricing that we took on the residential pricing which is we are going to move that price up and it may end up costing us some volume. But when you look at the overall competitive effect on our overall business both collection and landfill, driving that landfill price up is positive for the entire business.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "Yes. And you talked about the various impacts on volume you haven\u2019t kind of called that one out, does that suggest that you\u2019re not seeing a substantial volume impact from the higher landfill pricing?", "Jim Fish", "Yes so far it has been, actually I would say the landfill pricing environment has been probably as good or better than the environment on the collection side, right, because as we have seen our pricing increases we have not seen a dramatic loss of volume, we are hoping that will continue. Obviously, look, we can\u2019t do anything other than what we can do. But the price environment has been fairly stable there.", "Jim Trevathan", "This is Jim. As part of our answer honestly to our volume decline on the collection side is to raise prices on landfill side. We have talked about it a lot but that is a critical component and we\u2019re not -- I wouldn\u2019t say we are happy with the volume decline on the collection side. But we\u2019re pleased with what we are seeing on the landfill side. But pricing is critically important at those landfills to help us with our volume decline collection wise as is customer service. But when you look at collection pricing, and I know your question was about landfill pricing but they are in a related we are just simply not going to turn the coin over that price volume coin that\u2019s on the price side right now, we\u2019ll be smart about it and -- but we\u2019re not going to turn that coin over because it\u2019s detrimental to our results.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "Got it and then I had a follow-up question on the Wheelabrator proceeds. So by my calculation you are still around 3 times levered even without paying down anymore debt after you lose the $220 million in EBITDA. So how should we think about how much you are going to deploy into paying down debt immediately versus how much cash you will sit on for potential acquisition?", "David Steiner", "Well I think you\u2019re probably looking at where we were at the end of the quarter and we were a bit low there kind of artificially low with respect to leverage at the end of the quarter the reason for that is that because we hadn\u2019t had any share repurchase year-to-date we ended up using that to pay down our revolver. So a more normalized leverage ratio for us is 3% than as a consequence when you do divest that $220 million worth of EBITDA. Our calculation is we probably need about 400 million in debt pay down in order to maintain that leverage neutrality.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis", "Thanks for that clarification.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman of Stifel.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus", "", "If we could get a little clarity, sense of when you think the timing is for Wheelabrator?", "David Steiner", "It\u2019s a bit hard to predict because it\u2019s a function of FERC approval and that really is the biggest time controllable hurdle at this point. But in talking through this with ECP, we believe it\u2019s somewhere within kind of three to five months probably closer to three to four.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus", "So would you share with us then the year-to-date EBITDA, so inclined to pull it out of a model and model the business without it? What am I am I look at year-to-date at EBITDA?", "David Steiner", "Well on an annual basis the EBITDA as we said is about 220 million and really there is not a heck of lot of seasonality, there was a little bit more this year because of the real cold winter. But typically the volume is pretty static the price fluctuates a bit with your stronger electricity pricing quarters being Q1 and Q4. But I\u2019d straight line it for your analysis.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus", "So can you help me with the 220, because if you I take the 10-K data add back the charge, it gets to 171 million? So what\u2019s the difference between 171 and 220?", "David Steiner", "I\u2019d have to look at that Mike.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus", "And then was this shopped or was this is a privately-negotiated transaction?", "David Steiner", "What was the question again?", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus", "Was it shopped was the deal -- was this is a fully marketed?", "David Steiner", "While we didn\u2019t do a per se a process on it but we had interest from at least one other company where they actually send a non-binding letter of intent to us. And we went through quite a bit of work with them and came up with a number that was a fair amount lower than the 1.94. And then of course last year we -- probably no secrets to anyone but we had conversations with Covanta at that point as well. So I would say that that\u2019s why I wasn\u2019t formally a process pretty close.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus", "And then if could talk about the pricing environment, when you think about the 5% number you have used around the landfill side or the 3 plus in the collection. How would you frame the per cent rollback trend at this point? Is it worsening, stable or getting better. And I ask you in the context of volumes have been on a reasonably good positive trend, the market volumes. And how is that flow seeing sort of rollbacks?", "David Steiner", "Yes. We had a big jump up in rollbacks in 2012, since that time we basically held our rollbacks below 20%, and you saw the same thing this quarter. So I would say from a rollback perspective what you\u2019re seeing is very much stability. When you\u2019re turning something around you see a very low number, we turned it around literally on a dime and when you see someone turn something around that fast, you wonder is it sustainable? And what we found on the rollback side that is sustainable and so I\u2019d expect that to continue at below 20% into the future.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus", "And your churn rates are running at about 11.5%?", "David Steiner", "Yes the churn rate obviously it\u2019s affected by the national account loss. But if you take out the national account loss, you\u2019re looking at sort of 10% to 11% type churn.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus", "And then are you at this juncture and it would appear you\u2019re not replacing a 100% of your churn, you are replacing much of it but not all of it. Is that an accurate observation?", "David Steiner", "That\u2019s correct.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus", "If you were to replace 100% of the churn and probably would drive rollbacks, that\u2019s wide math effectively.", "David Steiner", "No I think that\u2019s right.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus", "And then on the landfill I just want to make sure I understood correctly on the landfill, the pricing issue, this is revisiting a strategy on collection be aggressive of our price now, let's bring a strategy to landfill, let's be aggressive on price and that's a newer initiative beginning about now? Did I understand that correctly?", "David Steiner", "Yes I mean we\u2019ve always known that the landfill pricing is one of the keys to a long-term pricing program on the collection line of business. As I\u2019ve said before when you are going through the worst economic recession that you had, at least in our lifetimes, and you are losing volumes fairly faster, but the landfill is a little hard to go in and drive a pricing program. As we have seen the economy recovers, we\u2019ve seen the volumes come back. It\u2019s a little easier to be more aggressive with the landfill. And we have done just that, and we would expect that to continue.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus", "So this is a great way to force discipline into the market to the independents. Have you seen any evidence that that is also helping your churn and your rollbacks that you are forcing them to absorb the single biggest costs they have? ", "David Steiner", "I would say, we certainly haven\u2019t seen any ripple of that from pricing throughout the market. Those small competitors, in the regional, even the national competitors that might not be integrated in the market, there is always going to be a healthy amount of competition in every markets we serve. So I\u2019m not sure that that if they can have that dramatic an effect, but to the extent that it will have an effect over time, it will be over time. We are certainly not seeing any effect currently.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Charles Redding of BB&T Capital.", "Charles Redding - BB&T Capital Markets", "Just a quick follow-up on the front-end load side, is it overly optimistic to expect some margin lift here from increased contribution? Are we simply just at a point in the recovery where we can't do that? ", "Jim Fish", "Are you talking about related to the transaction?", "Charles Redding - BB&T Capital Markets", "No, on the commercial side in terms of collection volumes?", "David Steiner", "Yes. We have to get better with our system. It\u2019s what I talked about earlier that the big leverage that we\u2019ve got in our business is really on the commercial side, because the density, the route density makes such a difference in there that you do have to look at from a contribution margin point of view. So as we look at our business what we are going to try to do is look at those lines of business where we can pick up volume without affecting the market place and then we\u2019re also going to look to start adding some density into our commercial wraps.", "Now again we are not going to do it in such a manner to upset the competitive dynamics in any particular market. So, it\u2019s going to take a period of time. Certainly as we see the economy improve and as we see the commercial business get better across the country that will give us more of an opportunity to go and take our fair share of the growth. We\u2019re not looking to grab market share here. What we\u2019re looking to do is to get our fair share of the growth. So as you start to see those volumes grow, you should see our volumes in the commercial line get better. ", "Charles Redding - BB&T Capital Markets", "That's helpful. And then in terms of the overall recovery, is it possible to see better commercial volume without housing? Are the two simply tied together such that you couldn't get better volume there?", " ", "David Steiner", "Yes, look, long-term. I have always said that what you\u2019ve got going on in the economic recovery is, you got housing starts for the first 18 months, we\u2019re sort of what I call it tuck-in housing. There was not a lot of new developments going up. It was tear downs and rebuilding houses. What you see in last 18 months, you started to see some big take downs of large property [swaps] and you\u2019ve seen new development, particularly in places like Texas, Florida, California, you are starting to see new housing development. What comes along with housing development is commercial business, the new gas station, the new restaurant, the new gas, the new grocery store, and so. You absolutely need to see a sustained housing recovery to see a robust commercial volume recovery.", "I think we\u2019re on -- you all see just like I do. The housing starts number are sort of going in fits and starts over the last year. But I would say that as we go around and talk to our market, the trajectory is clearly up. You\u2019re starting to see more and more housing developments, you\u2019re starting to see more and more businesses that might have gone out of business during the downturn, reopened. And so I would expect that throughout 2014 and particularly in the 2015 you should see those commercial volumes grow. Again, it\u2019s not going to be everywhere. This is a geographic game for us. You\u2019re not going to see commercial volumes grow as robust in some places as others. But in those places where it is growing we want to make sure that we get our fair share growth. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Barbara Noverini of Morningstar.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar", "Hi, good morning, everybody. You mentioned that national account losses are partially responsible for the acceleration of volume declines past your original guidance. So are you working through your national account contracts in a similar manner as the rest of your business from a pricing perspective? And secondly, are these contract losses also affecting your recycling volumes? ", "David Steiner", "Yes. They are not so much affecting our recycling volumes, but they are more so affecting just our traditional collection volumes. But it\u2019s exactly right. As we look through the national accounts, the largest one that we lost was a low single-digit margin contract. And so we\u2019re treating our national accounts business sort of just like we treated our residential business, 6 to 10 years ago which is we\u2019re not going to -- we always say, we\u2019re not doing this for practice and we don\u2019t need a lot of practice doing this. So we\u2019re going to make sure that we get a fair price on those national account businesses and we\u2019re not going to keep a national account just to maintain volume. The largest account -- the largest one that we lost again was a low single-digit margin business. For the full year we expect that we\u2019ll lose about $100 million of annualized revenue, of that annualized revenue about two-thirds of it will be very low single-digit margin. And about two-thirds of it has hit to June 30. So the pace of that volume loss will accelerate a little bit in the back half of the year but again you won\u2019t see a dramatic earnings hit because it was very low margin business.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar", "", "I know we've been asking you this about every line of business today, but what [inning] are we in the reviews of your national account businesses?", "David Steiner", "Look we know exactly what we want to do in our national account business. So I would tell you that from a planning point of view we\u2019re in the eighth inning, from an execution point of view I would tell you we\u2019re in the third inning.

As Jim said I think we\u2019d be remised without recognizing our colleagues at Wheelabrator who have done a phenomenal job over the years and we don\u2019t view this as an end of a relationship but as the beginning of another long-term relationship. We are still going to be the primary provider of volume to the Wheelabrator plant. So this will be a change in the relationship but it\u2019s been a great relationship and we expect that great relationship to continue.", "As we look at the rest of the year as Jim mentioned we\u2019ve got FERC approval which could take anywhere from three to five months. The good news with that is that it gives us three to five months to really develop a plan on what we\u2019re going to do with the proceeds from the divestiture. So I would expect that at the end of the third quarter we\u2019ll have a fairly well defined plan that we can talk to you all about how we\u2019re going to split those proceeds between purchasing tuck-in type of businesses and doing share repurchases. All of which we think is going to be a very positive driver for us at the end of 2014 and driving into 2015. So once again we look forward to the future and we\u2019ll talk to you all end of the third quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you for participating in today\u2019s Waste Management conference call.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the express written consent of Waste Management is prohibited.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's President and CEO, David Steiner.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. 2014 was a very good year for us. Our primary goals for the year were to continue to drive core price and focus on cost controls to drive growth in earnings, margins and free cash flow. We exceeded all of our goals, and we expect the momentum that we created to carry over into 2015. In 2014, we achieved our highest adjusted earnings per share ever. And our traditional solid waste business grew income operation and operating EBITDA, and expanded margins in both of these measures.", "For the full year of 2014, we achieved earnings per share of $2.48 and had total free cash flow of $3.4 billion. If we adjust free cash flow for divestiture proceeds and an approximate $210 million overpayment of taxes, we produced approximately $1.4 billion of free cash flow.", "During 2014, we set the stage for increasing shareholder value by selling our Wheelabrator operations and operations in Puerto Rico and Eastern Canada for proceeds of about $2 billion. Those assets, primarily Wheelabrator, accounted for about $0.18 of earnings per share and $231 million of operating EBITDA in 2014.", "In 2015, we expect to be able to enter into acquisition agreement to replace most, if not all, of that amount. However, we will be disciplined in our approach to buying an asset. We want to buy assets that fit within our business at prices that are accretive to our current trading multiple.", "We believe that by being patient and disciplined we can replace the divested operating EBITDA at a multiple of about seven times, which would leave us about $400 million of proceeds from our Wheelabrator divestiture to apply the share buybacks or other accretive tuck-in acquisitions.", "Combined with our strong operating free cash flow, we believe that we can apply significant cash to both of these areas, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Although we believe that we will identify acquisition targets by midyear, given timing uncertainty of both negotiations and any necessary regulatory approvals, our guidance assumes that we will not close any acquisitions in 2015, other than the previously announced acquisition of Deffenbaugh Disposal and our normal tuck-in acquisitions.", "We will also hold off on any significant share repurchases until we get a better feel for which acquisitions we'll be able to close and at what price. We would expect that by midyear, we'll be in a good position to begin to buy back shares, and we would expect to buy back enough shares to at least offset any 2015 dilution. Of course, we'll buy back more if we cannot identify attractive acquisition targets at reasonable prices.", "Turning back to our operations. Our pricing programs continued to drive earnings growth and margin expansion. At the beginning of 2014, we expected yields to be approximately 2% for the full year, and we exceeded that target. For the full year, our collection and disposal core price was 4%, with yields of 2.3%. We've now seen seven consecutive quarters with yield of 2% or greater. Each of our lines of business had positive yield for the full year, with the exception of landfill C&D.", "For the full year, core price in the commercial line of business was 6.2%; industrial was 8.1%; and we saw 1.8% in landfills. This has had some effect on volumes, but we continue to see the tradeoff as positive, as the operating margin in our traditional solid waste business was up 130 basis points. Our pricing team in areas have done a fantastic job, and they have plans in place to continue that success in 2015.", "For 2015, we expect that internal revenue growth from yield should again be 2% or more and for core price to be about 3.8%. Core price is more representative of our pricing activities because yield includes geographic and waste stream mix. Ultimately, we're focused on using price to drive dollars to our bottom line and core price best estimates the bottom-line impact of pricing. At 3.8% or higher, core pricing will once again drive margin expansion in 2015.", "As for volumes, we're starting to see some underlying positive trends. For the full year, our volume was a negative 1.4%, right about where we expected it to be. However, since the fourth quarter of 2013, we've seen a sequential improvement in volumes, culminating with the fourth quarter being the best volume quarter of 2014 at negative 0.8%. We also saw volumes in every line of business improve sequentially from the third quarter of 2014. We certainly are encouraged to see movements in the right direction.", "For instance, volume losses in both commercial yards and residential owned service gradually improved during 2014. While we're not ready to say that 2015 will have positive volumes, we do see improvement in 2015 such that volume should be between a negative 0.5% and flat for the full year.", "Of course, as recent storms on the East Coast demonstrate, our first quarter volumes can be affected by weather, but underlying trends have improved. So the price and volume trade-off continues to be very positive for the full year as the company's income from operations grew more than 10% and our income from operations margin grew 190 basis points.", "In addition, operating EBITDA increased 4% and operating EBITDA margins increased 140 basis points to 25.9%. We achieved those results despite a negative $0.02 per share impact to 2014 EPS from foreign currency translation, due to the impact of the strengthening dollar on our Canadian operations.", "On the recycling front, our operations performed well in the face of declining commodity prices. For the full year, our recycling line of business increased about $0.03 per share when compared to 2013. This improvement was driven by better operating cost performance, offsetting a more than 5% decline in OCC prices.", "Our managers did a great job managing their rebates and costs, as commodity prices declined throughout the year. Until recently, we had expected our recycling operations to remain flat in 2015. However, the recent slowdown in Western U.S. ports has had a dramatic effect on the movement of commodities overseas. We would join with others to encourage the federal government to take a more active role in the slowdown, which is not only having an effect on commodity prices, but on the entire U.S. economy.", "Lower demand out of China has also affected commodity prices. In the last few weeks, we've seen another drop in commodity prices such that we now expect recycling to have a negative effect on 2015 earnings of between $0.03 and $0.05 per share. That assumes that we do not see another drop in commodity prices, and given current uncertainty in the market, that's certainly possible. In the face of weaker commodity prices, we must continue to take actions to ensure the viability of recycling over the long-term. Jim will talk about some of the specific actions to improve our recycling operations.", "Turning to free cash flow. Our 2014 guidance was $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, and we generated $3.4 billion of free cash flow in 2014. However, we had two fourth quarter events that we would adjust out to get a more normalized free cash flow number. First was our sale of Wheelabrator; second, we overpaid about $210 million of 2014 cash taxes that will directly reduce 2015 cash tax requirements. Jim will go into more detail, but absent these actions, 2014 free cash flow would have been about $1.4 billion. We expect that free cash flow will once again be between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion in 2015, as we continue to focus on disciplined capital spending and driving earnings growth in our core business. Cash flow could be even higher if we're able to close any acquisitions to replace our Wheelabrator EBITDA, other than Deffenbaugh.", "So 2015 will be a transition year in which we continue our pricing and cost efforts, while focusing on redeploying our Wheelabrator proceeds. Nevertheless, our guidance of full year adjusted EPS of between $2.48 and $2.55 represents an increase of between 8% and 11% when 2014 is adjusted for divestiture earnings, which is in line with our long-term target for EPS growth of between 8% and 12%. Free cash flow is expected to be robust. And our redeployment of Wheelabrator proceeds will set the stage for accelerated earnings and free cash flow growth in 2016.", "I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our fourth quarter results and our 2015 outlook in more detail.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, David. I will review the results for the fourth quarter and expectations for 2015. First, SG&A cost discipline has been a major focus for the company in the past year. At the beginning of 2014, we expected that SG&A dollars would be flat when compared to 2013 and that SG&A margin would improve.", "The results for SG&A in 2014 were better than we expected. I'm pleased with the overall results as SG&A costs for the full year improved almost $40 million to $1.43 billion and improved as a percent of revenue by 30 basis points to 10.2%.", "For the fourth quarter, SG&A costs were $376 million, essentially flat compared to 2013. As a percent of revenue, SG&A costs rose 20 basis points to 10.9%. In the fourth quarter, we saw approximately $18 million in SG&A savings from our third quarter restructuring. These savings were offset by increases to long-term incentive compensation accruals and certain legal settlements. These settlements not only affected SG&A, but they also reduced free cash flow by almost $30 million. Without these accruals, SG&A expense as a percent of revenue would have been 10.3% in the fourth quarter.", "Based on preliminary information, for January we saw SG&A expenses improve $10 million when compared to January of 2014 on a base of $124 million. This is a good start to the year. And for 2015, we anticipate saving $60 million from the restructuring and thus we expect SG&A as a percent of revenue to be below 10% for the full year.", "Turning to cash flow. For the full year, we generated $3.4 billion of free cash flow. Without the divestitures and overpayment of cash taxes that David mentioned, free cash flow would have been about $1.4 billion. The $210 million of tax overpayments is composed of two parts. First, because passage of the tax extenders legislation was after our fourth quarter estimated tax payment had been made, the approximately $60 million cash tax benefit of bonus depreciation was not reflected in our cash tax calculations for 2014. The $60 million will result in a cash tax reduction in 2015.", "The remaining $150 million of overpayment relates to comparing our actual tax provision to the payments made throughout the year. Our estimates changed late in the year because of the close date of the Wheelabrator transaction and the impacts from impairments. Therefore, we ended the year in an overpaid position. This will be a free cash flow benefit in 2015, but will be largely offset by free cash flow from divested operations.", "For the fourth quarter, we returned $172 million to our shareholders through our dividend. For the full year 2014, we returned about $1.3 billion to our shareholders, consisting of $693 million in dividends and share repurchases of $600 million. Our board has indicated its intention to increase dividends in 2015 by 2.7% to $1.54 per share on an annual basis. This is the 12th consecutive year of increasing the dividend.", "For 2015, our anticipated annual dividends will result in approximately $700 million being returned to our shareholders. We also have authorization from our Board of Directors to repurchase $1 billion of our shares. However as David mentioned, our preference is to replace the divested operating EBITDA from Wheelabrator at attractive multiples before we repurchase shares. We believe we can accomplish this in 2015. At a minimum however, we would expect to be in the market repurchasing shares in the back half of the year to offset dilution.", "During 2015, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion and free cash flow in 2015 is expected to be between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion.", "Looking at internal revenue growth for the total company in the fourth quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 3.9% and yield was 2%, with volumes declining 0.8% for an organic revenue growth of 1.2%. This led to total company income from operations growing $54 million, operating income margin expanding 190 basis points, operating EBITDA growing $34 million, and operating EBITDA margin growing 140 basis points.", "Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefit of the price/volume tradeoff. Our commercial core price was 6% with yield of 3.9%. Our industrial core price was 8% with yield of 3.7%. And residential achieved 2.1% core price and 1.1% yield.", "Overall, collection core price was 5.1% and yield was 2.8%, with volumes declining 2.5%. The volume change was 110-basis-point improvement from the third quarter. This core price and volume led to income from operations growing $16 million and margin expanding 130 basis points.", "In the landfill line of business, we saw the benefits of both positive volume and positive yield in the fourth quarter, just as we have all year. We saw same-store average MSW rates increase year-over-year for the eighth consecutive quarter, up 1.3% from Q4 of 2013. This also was the highest fourth quarter MSW rate that we've seen since 1998.", "Total landfill volumes increased 6.4%. Combined special waste and revenue-generating cover volumes were a positive 8.9%. MSW volumes grew by 6.5% and C&D volume grew 17.7%. This led to income from operations growing $13 million, which is the seventh consecutive quarter of growth. Margins grew 80 basis points.", "Turning to recycling. As David mentioned, we need to further our current actions to ensure the long-term viability of recycling. When we look at recycling, we look at three phases: inbound product, processing, and outbound product. With respect to inbound product, we will be more aggressive in setting contractual limitations on contamination levels and impose contractual remedies for contamination in excess of such limitations.", "Contamination above 10% leaves to higher processing costs, and we need to continue to get assurances from our customers that they will either give us clean material or compensate us for higher processing costs. This will ensure that we only pay a rebate for the net volumes produced and not pay our customers for residue.", "Glass has always been a difficult commodity to recycle and an economic challenge. Unlike other recycled materials, recycled glass must compete with an abundant supply of virgin materials. As a result, glass recycling does not provide the same environmental benefits to the society and it's always been financially challenging for recyclers.", "In addition, glass is difficult to handle, hard on equipment, and as of today, only one company takes recycled glass for MRFs, so our options are significantly limited. With most commodities, we get paid to deliver recycled materials. Glass is the only commodity where we aren't paid for the outbound product. We actually have to pay to send it to a processor. We certainly recognize that our cities and communities want to divert glass because it is the second largest recyclable by weight. But given the many challenges associated with glass, we need to charge extra if a customer wants to recycle.", "Next, with respect to processing costs, we need to take a stronger stance to ensure that we recover our full processing costs. Processing costs increased due to circumstances beyond our control like the Chinese Green Fence. We need to recover those costs. So as we've said in the past, our strategy in pricing our recycle business is to recover our processing costs before we split the commodity value. Our contracts will also contain force majeure language to cover increases in processing costs beyond our control, and if our processing costs are higher than the commodity values, our customers will have to pay for the difference.", "With respect to outbound volumes, we need to ensure that our customers are paid their rebates based upon the rate we receive per tons sold and not on an indexed price that may or may not reflect reality. Finally, we need force majeure language for issues like the current port slowdown that can affect prices for commodities.", "These actions will support the long-term financial viability of recycling, which will not only benefit Waste Management, but will also benefit the environment and our customers by motivating us to continue investing in our recycling assets.", "Moving now to operating expenses. These expenses improved by $97 million in the fourth quarter and $110 million for the full year. For the full year, $50.5 million of savings were for costs associated with recently divested businesses. On a component cost basis, fuel costs for the year improved by $47 million. As fuel surcharge levels declined with diesel prices, it will have a dampening impact on revenue, but will continue to benefit margins.", "As a percent of revenue, operating expenses in the fourth quarter improved 170 basis points to 63.1%. For the full year, operating expenses as a percent of revenue improved 90 basis points to 64.3%. In 2014, our focus on improving operating costs saw significant traction, and we expect that improvement to continue into 2015.", "Finally, looking at our financial metrics. At the end of the fourth quarter, our weighted average cost of debt was 4.91%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 9% at the end of the quarter. The decline in the floating rate portion of our debt from the third quarter relates to the repayment of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility.", "Lastly, in January, we redeemed three series of senior notes with a weighted average coupon rate of 7% and paid the related make-whole premium. We used proceeds from the Wheelabrator divestiture to fund this transaction, pending consideration of potential debt refinancing options.", "The reported effective tax rate was approximately 0.3% in the fourth quarter and 23.6% for the full year. The rates were lower than our expected rate of 35%, primarily due to the tax implications of divestitures. The tax benefit from divestitures is removed from our as adjusted results.", "We did include in our as adjusted earnings per share a $0.02 per share tax benefit from adjustments to accruals and related deferred taxes and audit settlements. Adjusting a recorded rate for such items would have resulted in a rate of approximately 33%.", "In conclusion, 2014 was a very good year for Waste Management, as our employees did a great job of focusing on pricing, cost and cost controls. And for that, I want to say thank you. We were also able to successfully divest several operations in the year, which serves to both refocus the company on the core business and generate significant proceeds. As David mentioned, we will look to put those proceeds to work in 2015 with the intention of replacing the Wheelabrator operating EBITDA by early 2016. We're excited for continued growth in 2015 and look to accelerate that growth into 2016 and beyond.", "And with that, Janisha, let's open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey of Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thank you. Good morning, guys.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning, Alex.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "On the cost saves, you talked about $60 million benefit on the SG&A line. Is there any target for the cost of goods line for 2015 and expected cost saves from the cost initiatives you have in place right now?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, the cost of goods sold line, we certainly have seen an improvement in that line as we've taken some aggressive steps, but I don't have an exact number for you there, Alex. I think we can get something to you though.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "But the key, Alex, is that as we manage those rebates better, our cost of goods sold as a percent of the commodity price that we achieve continues to improve. And so, we would expect that to continue to improve in 2015. As Jim said, we got to take some steps to really fix the recycling business because if you look at not just at Waste Management, but across the entire recycling industry, you're seeing a divestment in recycling assets. And so, for the benefit not just of Waste Management, but I think for the viability of recycling in the United States, we have to have some core fundamental changes that Jim described to make the business long-term viable.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Makes sense, David. And on the Deffenbaugh acquisition, can you say when you expect that to close? And what you expect the contribution should be to the 2015 earnings number?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. We'll give the contribution number once we actually close it. And we would expect to be able to close it likely within the next 30 days.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Very good. Thank you. I'll turn it over.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Box of KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, guys.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning, Joe.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "So Jim, thanks for the rundown on the recycling business. I guess I'm just curious what your guys' views are on the market. If you look a couple years out, let's say hypothetically, commodity prices remain at this low level. I know a lot of operators are kind of intermingled with their businesses. So if you start to see guys really struggle in the recycling space, what is this space look like a couple years from now and how does that impact you?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So Joe, as David mentioned in his script, I mean, we've done a good job of compensating for some of this price declines. In fact, he said that we just recently changed to this 3% to 5% negative guidance and that was because for the month of January, we felt pretty good about compensating for what was, at the time, about a $10 decline in pricing. We've seen an additional decline in February and hence the negative guidance for recycling.", "As far as what it looks like going forward, boy, we have not been real successful in projecting the outlook for recycling over years. So the only thing we can do to control that is take an aggressive stance on changing these contracts and then take a tough stance on cost control. Projecting the commodity price is something we haven't been very adept at.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And Joe, again, look, the viability of recycling is, at its core, very simple. You sell the commodity for a certain price, right. In the past, what the industry has done is said we'll sell the commodity for a certain price and then whatever our processing cost is we'll be able to pocket the difference. The reality is as commodity prices have come down, you got instances where our processing cost is higher than what we are selling the commodity for. And so you can't have the business model where it says we'll sell the commodity, split the proceeds and hopefully cover our operating costs.", "The way we're changing the contracts is to say: look, we are going to recover our operating costs, whatever those might be and however those might be affected by things that we can't control like the Chinese Green Fence. So we're going to recover our processing costs. And if we're able to sell the commodity for more than our processing costs, then we'll split the proceeds with the customer. If our processing costs are higher than what we can sell the commodities for, we're going to have to charge our customers in order to recycle. And that's the only way that we can make recycling viable for the long-term.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Joe, we might add one other quick point and that's that the commodities that are being recycled over the long-term we think need to change. An example is the substantial city in Pennsylvania that just announced not recycling glass in the future. They recognize that the value of recycling the material is just not just positive. There's no real market for it, and they've decided not recycle glass. They made that announcement earlier this week. So that's a positive sign for us.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. I appreciate the color on that. Can you guys talk about your coal ash business, maybe how it's different versus some of your other peers? And then I've seen a couple of awards for coal ash to be shipped to some of your landfills. I'm just curious what the quoting pipeline looks like right now for coal ash? Are utilities starting to look at remediating old surface impoundments outside of South Carolina and North Carolina? Or is it still too soon to start thinking about that?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. It's really too soon. We need to really try to put numbers around the coal ash. But what I'd tell you, Joe, is that we saw this coming three years ago, two-and-a-half years ago when the regulations were first proposed and we've been out in front of customers trying to work on solutions ever since. And so, we're not new to the party here. We've been doing it for a long time. We've developed those customer relationships, and so we would expect to do \u2013 I mean, to the extent that there is revenue generated from the new coal ash regulations, we would expect to get more than our fair share.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Thanks for the color, guys. Take care.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Corey Greendale of First Analysis.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Hey, good morning.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "First, I had more of a historical question. So you touched on the cost of ops. I'm not sure that I have a complete grasp of why the cost of ops was down so much. So I know that press release cites divestitures. I think Wheelabrator wasn't divested to the very end of the quarter. So could you just maybe elaborate a little bit on what drove the strong improvement in cost of ops both on a dollar basis and as a percent of revenue?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. I think there were a couple things that drove the cost of operations down. First of all, we've taken a tough stance on \u2013 but the right stance to take on managing labor in operations. That will continue going forward. We've used some routing technology and that has started to bear some fruit. Additionally, of course, as everyone knows, fuel prices affect the cost of operations. And so while you see it coming off of the operating expense line, you'll also see it coming off the top line in the form of a fuel surcharge.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes, Corey, Jim Trevathan here. We're about halfway through at implementing our, what we call, service delivery optimization: the onboard computers that we put on all of our routed trucks and getting the value out of those through the routing tools that Jim mentioned. And the labor reductions, we've done a much better job recently at getting both labor and routes out as volume changes have occurred. And you see the results of that, in addition to fuel.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "So Jim or Jim then, if you look at the 2015 guidance, you said you expect SG&A to be below 10% of revenue. Can you get some sense of what cost of ops assumption is baked into the guidance?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Gosh, cost of operations, look, I think for 2015 operating costs, we expect that we will be able to continue the progress we've made in 2014. I don't see a big increase in OpEx as a percent of revenue.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes, we would expect to see some modest improvement in costs as a percent of revenue. The big issue that we've got is volume, right. I mean, I think you all know that the ability to leverage costs from new commercial volumes is dramatic. We haven't seen commercial volumes turn positive. So we would expect to see some modest improvement in cost of operations as a percent of revenue, but we'll really see that improve as we start to see commercial volumes pick up in 2015 going through 2016. And then, we'd also expect to continue to see improvement in our operating costs at the recycling line. So we'll see some modest improvement in operating costs. As Jim said, we'll see some good improvement on SG&A. So we should see that 100 basis point plus improvement to margins next year.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Okay. Great. And then, David, to your point on volume, first of all, I think you made a comment about storms in the East. Does that suggest that we should be expecting a somewhat softer than the trend line on volume in Q1? And then, the comment you just made about lines improving on the commercial side. Does that suggest that you think overall volumes could go positive at some point during 2015 and then in 2016?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. I wouldn't be surprised at all to see at the back half of 2015 that we start to see the trend line turning positive from a volume point of view. Probably not till later in the year, but given what we've seen from the economy and housing starts, I wouldn't be surprised to see that at all coming out of 2015 and into 2016.", "With respect to the first quarter, no look, we see volume reports on a very frequent basis. You've seen a little bit of a drop-off in volumes, but as you know, sometimes those volumes bounce back real quickly in March because of the weather. So no, we're not trying to say that we will definitely see down volumes in the first quarter. But given what you all, particularly up on the East Coast, in Boston and other parts of the East Coast, what you're going through, we just wanted to make sure that everybody understands that you really can't judge the full year by first quarter volumes.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Yes. Understood. Thank you.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Good morning.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Al.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "I just wanted to follow up on the volume question. It just strikes me as, I don't know if it's sending out a warning sign or what, but you guys are collecting trash, so I don't think, the weather has never stopped you before, so what's behind the comment, David?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "There is absolutely nothing behind that comment, other than the fact that we say it every year, which is when you start to see the seasonal uptick from March through June, we'll get a real good feel for the prior question, which is will we see positive volumes in the back half of the year. But the only point we're making is that we're not going to make any assumptions on full year volumes based on the first quarter because the first quarter always has a weather impact.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Great. And then on the volume side again, just what's ticking higher better than your expectations? Because I would have thought the volume guidance range would have been a little bit wider than 50 basis points to flat. In other words, closer to the down 1% to flat. So what's ticking up for you? And obviously, it showed up in the fourth quarter as well.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. Look, when we look across the various lines, let's take them one line at a time. On the commercial line, we're seeing net service increases improve. We're seeing pounds per yard improve. And I think we're seeing generally sort of overall economic improvement, whether it's new business starts or new housing starts.", "And so we've been waiting for the pick-up in commercial volumes for a long time. And I guess for the first time in the last three years, what I would say is we're pretty optimistic they're going to improve. Now, we're not going to try to say they're going to turn positive in 2015. But we haven't said in three years that we're pretty optimistic that they're going to improve in 2015.", "On the industrial line, again looking at the general economy, looking at housing starts, that's all good. A big part of our industrial line is our energy services, and I think everybody would acknowledge that energy services is a big question mark for 2015. But we've done a spectacular job in energy services of increasing our market share where we have assets. And so, we expect to see increased market share at least partially offset some of the volumes on the industrial line of business. So we're fairly positive there.", "On the residential side, we've lost a lot of residential contracts in the last few years, some of those intentionally, some of those not intentionally. And so the contracts that we wanted to lose on the residential side, we've basically gone through those. And so we should start to see some year-over-year at least a decline or an improvement in the rate of decline on the residential line.", "And then finally, looking at our national account business, again the national accounts that we wanted to lose, we've lost. We've got some, what I'd call, low-margin national accounts that we'll still look at in 2015, but we would expect our national account volume to begin to stabilize and grow toward the back half of 2015. So what I would say is that overall, we're very optimistic that we're going to see an improvement in volumes.", "Look, you're absolutely right about the 50 basis points. Is that a narrow range, yes, it's a narrow range. But what we really wanted to impart was that we're seeing volumes moving back closer to flat. And again going back to the prior question, we would expect them to actually start to turn positive toward the back half of the year. And so we gave that narrow range because we didn't want people to think they were going to turn positive, so you've got to start out with flat. And we wanted people to know that we think they're improving. So we didn't want to say negative 1%. So the point of going 50 basis points, I think it's a great question. The point is we wanted to impart that we're seeing improvement, but we're not ready quite yet to call positive volumes for 2015.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Al, I think the fact that a lot of that volume growth is coming on the collections side of the business highlights why it's so important on operating expense to really make sure that we continue with the efforts that Jim has put into place to really improve our operating expense as a percent of revenue, because as you know from 2014, really for us not a great year on collection volumes, a decent year on landfill volumes. But collection volumes come with a bit higher operating cost as a percent of revenue. So it is very important for us that we continue those efforts on the OpEx side.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "And that was, sorry Jim, that was to drive or recover collection volumes to gain the operating leverage, was that the point?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Right. As we see collection volumes start to improve, which was what we've seen with 110 basis point improvement sequentially from Q3 to Q4, we need to make sure that we have all of the pieces in place operating-wise to control costs. Collection volumes have a higher operating cost, variable operating cost than do landfill volumes. So we feel good about going into 2015 with those pieces in place.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And finally, if I may, I don't know if I heard correctly what the benefit in Q4 was on fuel, but what maybe have you baked into 2015 whether that's a dollar volume or a dollar level or versus margin benefit? And then secondly in regards to that, how do you expect the competitors to react, particularly in the highly competitive markets, on this lower fuel price because isn't that simply an incentive for them to perhaps even lower price? So do you see that as a particular option? And then finally, I think, David, congratulations to you on this past weekend's performance. Thanks.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So setting aside that congratulations, let me address the \u2013 we beat you to it. Let me address the first question, Al. Look, as far as fuel goes \u2013 I mean, look, large price declines as we've seen recently, large price spikes, put us into an under-recovery or over-recovery position. Large price declines put us into an over-recovery position. But over time, our fuel surcharge program fully recovers cost increases for us. So for the most part, we're generally agnostic with respect to the price of fuel.", "In 2015, we expect there would be a slight benefit to margin, maybe 10 basis points from lower fuel cost. But for the most parts, we would expect that that fuel surcharge, which has a lag to it, will catch up and we'll be in kind of a full recovery position where we aren't over-recovering or under-recovering depending on the direction of fuel.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And to the competitive question, I think generally what we've seen in declining fuel markets is that the competition doesn't generally take that as an opportunity to go out and lower price. They take it as an opportunity to improve their bottom line. And the other part is that, for the most part, our largest competitors also have a fuel surcharge, so it shouldn't have any difference to them whatsoever.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Thank you, David and Jim.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown of Raymond James.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, guys.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey. Jim, just at a very high level, can you just kind of bridge the $2.4 billion in pro forma operating cash flow to the midpoint here in 2015 to $2.7 billion? I mean, I'm just kind of looking for the big puts and takes. I mean, presumably, you've got a drag from commodities, FX, but then you do have some offsets with Deffenbaugh, the tuck-ins, internal growth, the cash taxes, et cetera. But just trying to help us understand the components of that $300 million?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. So as you said, there's going to be a number of pluses and minuses there. On the minus side, as we talked about, we've got some recycling challenges potentially. We have a little bit of added capital expenditures versus where we finished the year, mostly related to the big contracts coming on board.", "We have a year-over-year working capital hit from the fact that last year we accelerated bonus. But we also have some working capital pick-up as well: the fact that hopefully we won't have another big legal settlements this year. And we're making quite a bit of progress on working capital, as well on DSO and DPO.", "So on the plus side, we've got the restructuring impact. We have lower interest expense. We've got those working capital items. And then, really, at that point, you get to our core business, which includes the aggressive approach to cost control. It includes pricing. And so I think when you combine all of those, while there's a lot of kind of puts and takes, I think we feel comfortable with getting to the cash from operations growth figures.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And so of that $300 million, though, how much of it is this \u2013 the prepayment on the cash taxes? I mean, is that effectively a $200 million benefit in 2015?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "$210 million.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Okay. Good. And then on CapEx, how does that break down between maintenance and growth? And then can you break it down between trucks, landfill development, containers, et cetera, et cetera?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes, I mean, on the first question, maintenance and growth, probably, Jim, I would guess, $900 million.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "In both fleet and in landfills, approximately $900 million, $950 million split relatively equally, Tyler, with collection. We're moving it forward slightly versus the last three years. But on average, we bought about 1,000, a little over 1,000 trucks the last three years. And in 2015, we'll buy 1,020 trucks. So the plan moving forward roughly evenly split...", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Perfect. That's very helpful. And then, I think in the press release you guys noted that you would do a normal pace of tuck-ins. What exactly is that? I mean, how much are you looking to deploy there on that this would be excluding Deffenbaugh?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. I mean, excluding kind of use of proceeds for Wheelabrator, it's typically between $100 million and $200 million.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Perfect. All right. Thank you.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman of Stifel.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions this morning. Nice end to the 2014. On recycling, just so I understand all the data you're sharing with us on your guidance, giving the negative $0.03 to $0.05, but there's an offset. And if I look at the offset you recorded in \u2013 and the offset you trying to run the business better that you recorded in the fourth quarter, down about proportionally the same in 4Q as we are sort of going into 2015.", "So am I right in you've got about $0.12 you're trying to drive savings \u2013 or I mean, sorry, there's $0.12 of loss from paper and there's $0.07 to $0.09 of savings that you're trying to drive. So the question is how much more do you have to play in that sort of $0.07 to $0.09 range to work with going forward? If we're structurally in a long-term low paper price environment, and we got a long tail on the solution \u2013 I get you're working on the solution. But how much more do you have to play with in driving incremental improvements?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. I guess, Michael, when I look at this on a blended basis, so I'm not breaking it out, my answer won't be on a OCC versus plastics versus other commodities. But on a blended basis, we finished the year 2014 at $98, and we saw a January drop about $10, so to $89 and that impacts us on the 6 million tons that we actually pick up and take to our MRFs, about $60 million in revenue, which equates to somewhere in that $0.03 to $0.05 range on the EPS line.", "We think in January, the cost control that we put into place fully compensated for that which is why we were prepared to come on a call and say we thought it'd be flat. And then with the February decline, we just have not been able to put the more stringent contract changes and cost controls in place yet. So can we do that? That is our plan. But at this point we're trying to be a little conservative because of the kind of the falling knife here, so to speak.", "So we think there's probably $0.03 to $0.05 in the $80 number, which is where we may finish the month of February in that blended rate. If things go to heck from there and fall to $60, then I think all bets are off with respect to that $0.03 to $0.05. But right now, we feel good about the contract changes that I went through in detail in my script. We feel good about the cost controls that we put into place, not only in January, but in all of 2014.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Fair enough. If the port strike \u2013 and I know this is a tough one because too much guessing I suppose. But if the port strike ends, say at the end of this month, lots of things can change quickly. But how long does it \u2013 excuse me, if the port strike is prolonged, how long can it go before you miss the seasonal uptick, in your mind? Like if it runs into March, even to the middle of March, have we just missed the seasonal window because Asia has to find a source of paper and they go looking elsewhere?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. A couple things, Michael, first of all, it's difficult to disaggregate the effect of the port strike into its component parts in that $0.03 to $0.05. So it's tough to tell. There are a couple of different moving parts. There's a weaker Chinese economy. There's quality issues with outbound product. And there is, of course, the port strike.", "One of the concerns we have, honestly, about the port strike is that there's a lot of products sitting idle at this point. When that does eventually get resolved, all that product ends up out on the market, which could have a dampening effect on commodity pricing. So I didn't do a very good job of answering kind of your seasonal uptick question there, and I'm not sure I know how to answer that because it's hard to predict what's going to happen with the port strike. It's also hard to separate the port strike in that $0.03 to $0.05 negative guidance that we gave you because there's a couple of different moving parts.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Fair enough.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. Michael.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yes. Hi, David.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Back when we saw the energy price drop, I heard an oil man say something that I thought was a pretty good quote. He said nothing solves low energy prices like low energy prices because, at some point in time, the market stabilizes and you find equilibrium. And I would say nothing solves low commodity prices like low commodity prices. I mean, you're seeing a pretty stark disinvestment in recycling assets. And you're seeing a lot of the smaller players starting to close up shop. That gives us a great opportunity to restructure the recycling business, to restructure it to where we can make a guaranteed return every year, which means we can invest in recycling assets.", "Look, we cannot invest in recycling assets in a situation like what you and Jim were just talking about, where nobody has any idea where commodity prices are going. And so, we're going to use the opportunity to make sure that we restructure our business such that we can make it profitable come hell or high water. And so, that's really where our focus is, is driving out the operating cost that we can today and then reorganizing the business and only bidding contracts that follow our statement of how we need to make a profitable business out of recycling. We're just not going to sign contracts that put so much risk of commodity prices on our back.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Fair enough. And I get that. I saw that, what you did with Philadelphia. Foreign exchange was $0.02 in 2014. It's about the same change year-over-year. So thinking it's about $0.02 in 2015, that's the right way to think about it?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I'm not sure I'd give it $0.02 in 2015. Again, kind of hard to predict what the dollar will do versus the Canadian dollar, but we didn't put anything in for foreign currency impact in 2015. So I would say, it's flat. If we do have an impact, then...", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We'll find another way to overcome it.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "...we'll find a way to overcome it.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Got it. Okay. Fair enough. And then, Jim, you said that you paid down some debt in January. Just so we get the right sort of run rate on the interest expense either based on that revised total debt, can you talk about what you think the interest expense number is? Or tell me what the total debt number is, I'll work backwards into it myself? But what am I looking at starting in January, now that you paid down more debt?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So cash interest decreased by $17 million in 2014 and that was due largely to a couple things, first of all, the Q2 recycling of the $350 million senior notes. We also had some tax exemplary marketings that came in at lower rates. And then of course in January, we made whole those three senior notes with a weighted average coupon of 7%. So what will the interest rate be? It's kind of yet to be determined on what the rates will be on the refinancing. And the cash impact is our cost of debt is coming down. Wouldn't surprise me if the cash impact is similar to 2014.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. All right. And then when you frame Wheelabrator, are you going to either provide restated numbers on a quarterly basis, so we know what it looks like year-over-year comparing without it? Or can you at least tell us what was the revenue number that I should be pulling out of my quarters or at least for the full year in 2015?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes, the supplemental schedule that came out pretty much is all. It's divested operations. But for the most part, it's Wheelabrator. So revenue \u2013 the way we've adjusted out to kind of get you to an apple-to-apples is $852 million. Now that's Wheelabrator plus Puerto Rico and the Maritimes, but largely Wheelabrator. And then adjusting out $231 million in EBITDA, $220 million of that was Wheelabrator. So again, largely on every one of those metrics on that schedule, it's for the most part a Wheelabrator adjustment.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And I think, Michael, I think last quarter we mentioned when we announced the divestiture, we mentioned that, obviously, Wheelabrator, the $0.18 that's coming out of earnings doesn't come out equal every quarter. I think we mentioned last quarter that electricity prices last year in the first quarter were very high. So there was \u2013 I think it was $0.05 of earnings per share from Wheelabrator in the first quarter of last year. And so it won't come out equally every quarter. It'll come out a little bit more weighted toward the first quarter than the other quarters.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Fair enough. And then cash taxes paid in 2014?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Cash taxes in 2014?", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yes.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Let's see here. Cash taxes in 2014, $763 million, and then we expect 2015 cash taxes to be about $517 million, something like that.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Right. And that delta on the one, well actually the whole $210 million, that's I mean, if we don't get another extension bonus accretion, that doesn't repeat, and then the $150 million is all about having done divestments. So that's a one-time. Those are both one-time events, right?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "That's right.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then special waste activity, are you seeing volumes that would indicate that non-residential construction may be starting to percolate in a positive direction?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. We've seen special waste volume pretty strong all year. And I think it really is the untold story of the lower energy prices. It started out with natural gas and then it's moved to oil. You've seen a lot of construction projects, particularly along the Gulf Coast where we have great positioned assets. And so you've seen great strength in it in 2014. We'd expect that to continue in 2015.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then I'm surprised you haven't been asked it yet, David, but the price gate for 2015. So you had a different type of bonusing program for the last couple years. What are you doing differently in 2015? And can you share some of the hurdles that you've set for bonuses and how the bonus accrual would work in 2015?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. It's a great question, Michael. As I've said before, you've got two options with the pricing gate. You can either \u2013 well, you can do nothing, but doing nothing for us is not an option. So you've got the opportunity to do the carrot or the stick. The last two years, we had a pretty big carrot out there, where we said if you can get over 2% yield, we're going to basically pay the 2012 bonus that everybody missed out on because we didn't do pricing very well in 2012.", "And so, in 2015, we'll go back. I hate to use the word, but we'll go back more toward the stick side. We've paid out those bonuses. Everybody is very happy, but that doesn't mean that you can now sit back and rest on your laurels. And so, we'll go back to a price gate where everybody \u2013 we basically give a target to every area, and every area has got to meet their price target. And if they don't meet their price target, we can adjust their bonus by up to 50%.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And will the gate this year include both a landfill driver and a collection? Or it doesn't matter how they get it?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. When we do it, we basically go to back to what I talked about before, core price, right. Look, the reality is as you know, we've been putting a lot of emphasis on landfill pricing, and we'll continue to put an emphasis on landfill pricing. But from a bonus point of view, what we're really looking for is dollars to the bottom line. And so one market might be able to drive that with the landfill, another market might be able to drive it through industrial, and another market might be able to drive it through their commercial business, another one might have to look to their franchise business to drive it. And so there's as many ways to drive it as there are lines of business. We just want to make sure that they get the total dollars to the bottom line. But I can promise you that from a management focus point of view, we've got a lot of management focus on the landfill line.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Michael, Jim Trevathan. I would tell you though that Dave's exactly right that they can get it in any line of business. However, the targets are comparable to last year by area, and they can't get it unless they hit all lines of business. They can't totally load up on one as opposed to touching all of the lines of business. So I think you'll see it come in just about the same as last year, as 2014.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Got it. Okay. Great. And then Jim Fish, on cash flow from ops, you finished 2014 at $2.331 billion. If I'm understanding the comments that were made earlier, I can take $90 million and say that's a permanent change on a year-over-year basis and $210 million is a one-time. And so looking sort of modeling out multi-year cash flow from ops, I'm not going from 16.5% to 20% of revs. I'm still, 16.5% is improving by about $90 million to maybe 17%. But I'm making improvement, but that's the way to think about it, right?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. I think that's right.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Great.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey look, Michael, I think the piece that you wrote hit the nail right on the head. We're going to see good cash flow improvement. We'll start to see great cash flow improvement when we get the recycling business straightened out.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Right.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "One last answer for you that you asked initially was revenue for Wheelabrator, revenue for Wheelabrator $817 million of that $852 million that we show on the schedule.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thank you so much and good luck in 2015.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Levine of Imperial.", "Scott J. Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "Hey. Good morning, guys.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Morning.", "Scott J. Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "I just wanted to be clear on the comments regarding the thoughts on replacing the Wheelabrator or the lost business in general at seven times multiple. Firstly, should we be assuming that \u2013 what should we be assuming for share repurchase in your 2015 guidance, should I say? And then the seven times multiple you expect to pay, is that strictly on the solid waste side of the business? Or maybe a little update with regard to your interest in energy waste and additional color regarding your assumptions there.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. So for the share repurchase, you can assume that we offset dilution, but that we're going to do it in the back half of the year. So obviously, there will be a little bit of an earnings effect because you're not replacing dilution right at the beginning of the year. And so, we would expect to do share repurchases to offset dilution.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And as far as energy services goes, look, there's two things going on with energy services right now. On the price side, and I think you may have heard that from some of the other calls earlier or last week I guess, on the price side, we're working with E&P companies on addressing their price concession requests. We'll see where that ends up.", "On the volume side, we do expect to see a slowdown in drilling. I guess the good news is though that it seems to be hitting the big three the hardest, those being Permian, Bakken and Eagle Ford. And we have no exposure in Permian and limited exposure in Bakken and Eagle Ford. So it's also important to understand that our energy services business, while it's a great business for us, is still small as a percentage of our overall business. And while we will feel some price and volume pressures there in 2015, I think we'll be able to make up that in the other parts of our manufacturing and industrial business such as coal ash and petrochemical plant production, things like that.", "Scott J. Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "Got it.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And then, Scott, to the question of the replacement of the EBITDA, the acquisitions that we do will be core solid waste or very closely related to core solid waste. So we feel pretty comfortable that we can look at those type of acquisitions and understand exactly what kind of synergies we're going to get out of those, right. And so what we've always said is that we're not going to go out and pay a higher multiple than what we're trading at. If I'm going to buy something at the multiple we're trading at, and we've always used sort of the long-term 8.5 times EBITDA, I'd rather buy back our own stock than buying a business I don't know.", "And so, post synergies, we'd expect those type of acquisitions to, on the high end, come in at sort of the 7 to 8 times EBITDA, and on the low end, come in at sort of the 5 to 6 times EBITDA. So somewhere between, I would say generally when we're looking to replace the Wheelabrator divested EBITDA, I would say that generally, we're looking at larger acquisitions which trade a little bit higher than normal tuck-in acquisitions. So I would say that the EBITDA there is going to be somewhere between 6 and 8 times. We used 7 for our assumption, and that assumption is made at least to us being able to replace the full amount of Wheelabrator EBITDA and still have a significant amount of cash proceeds left.", "Scott J. Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "Right. So to be clear, you do see enough within the pipeline of that larger acquisition type you're talking within core solid waste to assign a high probability to your chances of replacing the bulk of that, with good visibility, by the middle of the year?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. I would say \u2013 I wouldn't put high probability on it quite yet. I think by midyear we'll know if there's a high probability. We've got some good acquisition candidates, but we've got to make sure that we can do a deal that works for both of them and for us. And so we've talked to a few larger acquisition targets that it seems like we're on the same page. We've talked to at least one where we're not on the same page, where they wanted more like 11 to 12 times EBITDA.", "And we basically said look, we've got two choices. We can either buy your business at 11 to 12 times EBITDA or we can go in and buy smaller businesses that mirror your geographic footprint and we could go in and do that. And so we're not going to pay 11 to 12 times EBITDA. We'd rather go out and buy smaller \u2013 in that geographic area, we'd rather buy smaller companies.", "So we do think there's some targets, but before I say that I'm confident, we can replace the Wheelabrator EBITDA, we want to make sure that we're on the same page from a valuation point of view. And like we said, we should have a very good feel for that by midyear.", "Scott J. Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "Okay. We'll stay tuned. Thanks.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Barbara Noverini of Morningstar.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Research", "Hey. Good morning, everybody.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Morning.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Research", "When analyzing the acquisition landscape, can you give us a general sense for the health of the recycling operations of tuck-in candidates that are similar in size to a Deffenbaugh, for instance. So if these businesses come with existing recycling contracts that are unattractive from a rebate standpoint, let's say, do you have to wait for these contracts to be rebid? Or can you improve the recycling economics of these tuck-ins immediately, despite instituting some of the costs control you've talked about today?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. Generally, frankly, the acquisitions that we're looking at really don't have a recycling component associated with them. And quite honestly, if they did have a recycling component associated with them, we're either going to pay very little for it or we're actually going to subtract from it. I think you hit the nail right on the head. If they have bad recycling contracts that they can't get out of, we're just not going to pay them for it. Or we might even reduce the price because of those recycling contracts.", "So when we look at the acquisition candidate, what we're going to is we're going to pay for the business that we know. We're going to pay for the business that we can very easily find out what kind of synergies we get. And then we're not going to pay for the businesses where we don't have the synergies. But you're also correct that if they did have a recycling component, there's plenty of places where geographically we can then consolidate with our facilities.", "So what I would say as a quick summation is that most of the assets that we're looking at buying don't have a strong residential recycling component to them. To the extent that they do, we would take that into account in connection with the value we pay for the business.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Research", "Got it. That's helpful. And then, what is your appetite for acquisitions within energy services? So you had mentioned increasing market share, so are you looking at this area in particular to deploy some of the Wheelabrator proceeds?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. We're probably looking at it a lot harder at $80 oil then $50 oil. But look, over the long-term, I think that's going to be a very good business. If we could get assets in that line of business at the right price, we would certainly look at doing that. But I would tell you that the right price today is not what the right price was six months ago. And so, it would have to be something where we would feel fairly confident that over the long-term, we could make the business profitable.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Research", "Got it. Thanks and great job this year.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you all for joining our earnings call. As you can see, our team here at corporate and our team out in the field created some great momentum in 2014. We fully expect that to continue through 2015. And as we replace the Wheelabrator EBITDA in 2015, we're going to accelerate that growth into 2016. So thank you all and we'll talk to you soon.", "Operator", "Thank you for participating in today's Waste Management conference call.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the express written consent of Waste Management is prohibited.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's President and CEO, David Steiner.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. We're very pleased that we earned $0.49 per share in the first quarter, an increase of almost 9% from our 2014 first quarter results, when adjusted to exclude the earnings from divested businesses and assets. Our EPS increased despite $0.03 of year-over-year headwinds from lower recycling commodity prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuation.", "Our field and corporate teams overcame those headwinds through continued improvement in our pricing and cost control programs. This led to growth in income from operations, operating EBITDA, margins and free cash flow and marked a strong start to 2015. These results were in line with our internal expectations and we expect to see continued improvement as we progress throughout the year.", "During the first quarter, we reinvested a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our waste-to-energy business. We completed the acquisition of Deffenbaugh Disposal at a pre-synergy operating EBITDA multiple of just under 8. Once fully integrated, the acquisition should add about $52 million of annual operating EBITDA.", "On the acquisition front, we continue to have discussion with sellers, but we'll remain disciplined and not overpay for assets. If we cannot identify core businesses to acquire at reasonable prices, we'll buy the business that we know the best, ours, by doing a share buyback. Even if we do identify acquisition targets at reasonable prices, we will still purchase at least enough shares to offset dilution and we'll begin buying those shares in the second quarter.", "Turning back to our operations, our pricing programs continued to drive earnings growth and margin expansion. For the first quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.4% and yield was 2%. We've now seen eight consecutive quarters of yield at 2% or better. In the first quarter of 2015, each of our lines of business had positive yield.", "In the first quarter, we also saw core price improve 20 basis points from the first quarter of 2014 to the highest level that we've achieved. We also saw the highest core price ever in each of the commercial, industrial and landfill lines of business", "Core price in the industrial line was 9.4%, 6.6% in the commercial line, 2.3% in our landfill line, and 2.1% in our residential line. This is a tremendous accomplishment by our team in light of depressed CPI levels.", "So, we continue to use core price to drive margin expansion. And in the first quarter, our traditional solid waste business income from operations margin increased 110 basis points and our operating EBITDA margin increased 130 basis points. Clearly, the trade-off of emphasizing core price over obtaining lower margin volume remains very positive for us.", "Turning to volumes, our traditional solid waste volumes declined 1.2% in the first quarter of 2015 versus a decline of 3.2% in 2014. We saw some very positive trends in our commercial and industrial lines of business.", "The losses in our commercial volumes improved 200 basis points from the first quarter of 2014 and industrial volume losses improved 520 basis points. Both the commercial and industrial lines of business saw the lowest rate of decline in seven quarters. So the volume trends are very positive.", "The revenue trend was not as positive but it reflects the loss of low margin work that we intentionally shed. Total company volumes declined $95 million or 3% in the first quarter. The overall volume decline stems from a $51 million decline in national account contracts and residential business as we shed this low-margin business consistent with our revenue strategy.", "We also saw a $43 million decline in our commodity-driven businesses from lower-recycling commodity sales driven by the West Coast port slowdown, and to a lesser extent, lower landfill gas-to-energy sales. Consequently, although total volumes are down more than we expected, it's due primarily to volumes in lower margin lines of business while the volumes trends in our most profitable lines of business are encouraging, and we expect the positive momentum to improve as we see our normal seasonal upturn.", "Our recycling operations resulted in a $0.02 decline in earnings per share compared to the first quarter of 2014. This decline is due to the more than 14% drop in average commodity prices for the quarter and an 8% decline in volumes associated with the slowdown in Western U.S. ports and contractual losses as we renegotiate contracts to include improved processing fee and rebate structures.", "On a positive note, we've seen our operating costs improve as we tighten our enforcement on contaminated loads, and our capacity utilization is at the highest level that we've seen. However, the operational improvements have not been enough to offset the decline in commodity prices, so we will continue to look to improve operations and rationalize our recycling assets until we see the market improve.", "Given the continued weakness in overall recycling commodity prices and lower volumes, the full-year impact from our recycling business is now anticipated to be closer to negative $0.10 per share when compared to 2014 versus our original outlook of between negative $0.03 and negative $0.05 per share. We also expect foreign currency translation to continue to be about a $0.01 per share headwind per quarter for the remainder of the year.", "So 2015 is off to a strong start, and we have the momentum to achieve our full-year goals of adjusted EPS of between $2.48 and $2.55 per share despite lower-than-expected recycling results and foreign currency translation headwinds. We also expect to achieve our full year free cash flow guidance of between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion.", "As we move through the second quarter and see the seasonal upturn, we expect to see continued improvement in our volumes. Combined with our focus on cost and pricing, this should lead to continued growth in earnings and free cash flow.", "I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our first quarter results in more detail.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, David. During the first quarter of 2015, we decided to refinance a significant portion of our high coupon senior notes. As a result of the combination of a make-whole redemption and a cash tender offer to purchase certain senior notes, the issuance of $1.8 billion of new senior notes, we reduced the weighted average interest rate of our portfolio by 100 basis points, extended the weighted average duration of these debt obligations by three years, and reduced senior note debt by $181 million. The after-tax charge for the early extinguishment of debt related to these financing transactions was $344 million.", "We also had two balance sheet items in the quarter. We had a true-up of the sale of our Wheelabrator subsidiary, which reduced our gain on sale, and we impaired a short-lived landfill asset. Those two items negatively affected earnings by $0.03 per share but had no effect on free cash flow.", "In the first quarter of 2015, our focus on reducing SG&A cost continues to bear fruit. Overall, SG&A cost declined $27 million compared to the first quarter of 2014. When you adjust 2014 for the operations that we divested, our year-over-year SG&A cost improvement was $15 million, consistent with our expectations for savings from our reorganization. With the strong results in the first quarter, we expect to achieve our full-year SG&A goals of reducing SG&A cost by $60 million.", "Turning to cash flow for the first quarter, free cash flow was $285 million in the first quarter of 2015, an improvement of $22 million when compared to the first quarter of 2014, excluding the $221 million of free cash flow related to operations divested in 2014.", "Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $233 million, $33 million less than the first quarter of 2014. However, we spent about the same about of capital as a percentage of revenue in both years. Given the strong start to the year, we still expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. And free cash flow in 2015 is expected to be between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion.", "First quarter revenues were $3 billion. In addition to the $220 million impact from the divestitures and a $25 million impact from foreign currency fluctuations, the lower fuel surcharge negatively affected revenues by $36 million.", "Looking at internal revenue growth for the first quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.4%, with volumes declining 1.2%. This led to total company income from operations growing $21 million, operating income margin expanding 130 basis points, operating EBITDA growing $11 million, and operating EBITDA margin growing 140 basis points.", "Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefit of the price/volume tradeoff. Our commercial core price was 6.6%. Our industrial core price was 9.4% and residential achieved 2.1% core price.", "In addition to the continued strong momentum on pricing, we saw some positive momentum in volume. Commercial volumes were down 2.8% in the first quarter of 2015 versus a decline of 4.8% in 2014, a 200 basis point improvement and the best result in the past seven quarters.", "Industrial volumes improved 520 basis points from a negative 5.7% in the first quarter of 2014 to a negative 0.5% in 2015. In April, we see industrial volumes turning positive for the first time since the first quarter of 2013. Residential volumes declined 3.1% in the first quarter 2015 versus a decline of 3.5% in 2014, but those losses were generally intentional as we pushed price over volume in our residential line.", "Overall, collection core price was 5.7%, with volumes declining 2.3%. The volume change was a 220-basis-point improvement from the first quarter of 2014. This core price and volume led to income from operations growing almost $14 million and margin expanding 140 basis points.", "In the landfill line of business, we saw the benefits of both positive volume and positive core price in the first quarter. We saw same-store average MSW rates increase year-over-year for the eighth consecutive quarter, up 1.2% from Q1 2014. Combined special waste and revenue-generating cover volumes were a positive 2.3%. MSW volumes grew by 5.7%, and C&D volume grew 10.9%.", "Total landfill volume increased 1.8%. This led to income from operations growing $2.5 million, which is the eighth consecutive quarter of growth, and margins grew 40 basis points. We believe that weather had some impact on landfill volumes, but the special waste pipeline looks strong, so we expect to see positive landfill volumes all year.", "Looking at our recycling line of business, we had some challenges with low commodity prices and declining volumes. The impact from our recycling business was a negative $0.02 per share in the first quarter when compared to the first quarter of 2014. That decline would have been more than $0.05 per share if we'd not been taking steps to improve contracts and reduce operating costs. Those steps included auditing inbound material to ensure compliance, renegotiating contracts to recover the appropriate amount of processing costs and improving the quality of materials coming into our plants through consumer education.", "We were also able to improve the overall operating efficiency of our plants. As David mentioned, we expect our recycling operations are going to be a headwind all year, but we're seeing the results of our efforts to improve the operations.", "When commodity prices rebound, we're in a great position to see meaningful earnings improvements. In the meantime, we will curtail capital spending in our recycling operations which will allow us to allocate more of our $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of capital spend to our core solid waste assets.", "Moving to operating expenses, we continue to see improvement in all of our cost lines. With respect to total operating costs, operating cost as a percent of revenue improved 130 basis points to 64% and improved $131 million in the first quarter after adjusting for divestitures. $83 million of the improvement related to lower diesel costs and lower recycling commodity rebates to our customers.", "We are also seeing the continued benefits from our service delivery optimization program and our labor costs as we see improved efficiency in all of our collection lines of business. Labor and related benefits improved $17 million when compared to the first quarter of 2014. The remaining savings were primarily driven by improvements in subcontractor costs.", "Finally, looking at our other financial metrics, at the end of the first quarter, our debt-to-total capital ratio was 62.3%. Our expected 2015 weighted average cost of debt is 4.3% and the floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 9% at the end of the quarter.", "In the first quarter, we returned $176 million to our shareholders through our dividend. As David mentioned, we expect to return more cash to our shareholders in the second quarter as we look to repurchase shares to offset dilution.", "Our income tax rate in the first quarter was 41%. Adjusted for items excluded in our as-adjusted results, the tax rate was 34.2% which is closely in line with our expected tax rate of approximately 35% for the full year.", "To summarize our quarter, with the exception of recycled commodity prices, virtually all of our financial and operating metrics are tracking ahead of our internal expectations and our previous guidance. We expect that to continue throughout 2015.", "I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work in the first quarter. I know that they will continue their focus to make 2015 a successful year. And with that, Janisha, let's open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of Corey Greendale of First Analysis.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Hey. Good morning.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Corey.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Corey.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "So, first, I apologize, this is a little bit of a mechanical question, but in the press release, the internal growth numbers that you're giving, are those adjusted for \u2013 are you pulling out divestitures in the denominator from the year prior period?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, we are pulling out divestitures. Yeah.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Okay. So, in other words, if you pull out divestitures, volume was down 3% just based on the operations that you still have?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "That's correct.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That's correct. Yeah.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Okay. Good. Thank you. I'm getting a slightly different number. I'm not sure why. But anyway, so my question is it sounds like the core business is kind of moving in the right direction. So could you just talk about a little bit more detail on the pieces that \u2013 where the volume is declining, like national accounts. Is that \u2013 are you seeing more aggression there? Do you think you're hitting the ceiling on what you can do in terms of pricing?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Basically, Corey, that's the carryover of our largest national account that we lost last year and then two residential franchise contracts that we lost in our Southern Group last year. And as you can imagine, all of those contracts were single-digit margin and not revenue that we wanted to keep without significant price increases. So, that was business that we pretty much intentionally shed.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "And the volume decline didn't accelerate Q4, correct?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Pardon?", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "The volume was not down as significantly in Q4 as it was in Q1 of 2015. Is that correct?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, Corey, when we look at it, we look at the specific lines of business. When you look at the commercial and industrial line, they were actually improved from the fourth quarter. On the commercial line, we were down 3.5% in the fourth quarter. We were only down 2.8% in the first. On industrial, we were down 0.9% the fourth quarter. We were only down 0.5% in the first quarter.", "And that's \u2013 really, that what's you've got going on in our business. What we're trying to say both in the scripts and in the press release is that we're seeing improving volumes in our most profitable lines of business. We're seeing declining volumes in our less profitable lines of business like recycling and residential. But even in residential, you can see it getting a little bit better year-over-year by 40 basis points and it only went backwards 20 basis points from the fourth quarter to the first quarter.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Okay. What I'm trying to get a sense of is just given the \u2013 what seems to be the improving environment overall. And David, I understand things are moving in the right direction on the commercial/industrial. So, the piece like residential, for example, is it getting more competitive for some reason than it has been over the past year?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. No, I wouldn't say it's getting more competitive. I think residential has always been a very competitive line of business. Look, those are big contracts, big slugs of revenue, and generally, you've got a lot of different bidders. So, there's always been aggressive players on the residential side. Frankly, I would say that we're seeing a little bit of more stability on the residential side, as folks that have taken those low-margin contracts from us over the last few years start to realize they can't make a lot of money on them.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Especially, Dave, when you look at the capital that's necessary to fund those new contracts, people are starting to look at it a little more diligently than we think in the past.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Corey, just to give you a sense of \u2013 you asked about the volume in Q4 versus Q1 and you also asked about kind of the difference between 1.2% which is our traditional solid waste volume loss and 3%. To answer the second one first, the difference between the 1.2% and the 3%, 0.8% of that is commodities, 0.2% is renewable energy, and then you got another 0.2% which is oil and gas, and then you got 0.6% which is national accounts. That 0.6% is $21 million and $18 million of that is Wal-Mart. So to go from the 1.2% to the 3%, it's largely commodities, national accounts, and energy services or oil and gas.", "When you go from Q4 to negative 0.8% on volume to that negative 3%, it doesn't look dramatically different. In fact, collections actually up, as David mentioned, collection was up 0.2% but then you've got energy services that was down 0.5% of that delta. You have renewable energy that was down 0.4%. You have oil and gas that was down 0.4% and recycling down 0.4%. And then the other one that is \u2013 that changes from Q4 to Q1 is the landfills were down a bit versus Q4, and the reason for that is really special waste was a little softer than we thought, probably largely because the weather in Q1 was quite a bit different than the weather in Q4.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Yeah. Actually, that's really helpful, Jim. And one other quick one, then I'll turn it over. Do you have an estimate of what the year-over-year impact \u2013 I'm assuming it was some benefit \u2013 was from lower fuel costs net of the lower surcharges?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. That was about $0.02 in the quarter. But from our perspective, you get lower fuel because you get the recovery from the fuel surcharge, but we also have some oil and gas assets that we maintain. And so when you look at the overall effect, it was about flat.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey of Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hey, Alex.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "A couple questions for you, guys. First, thinking about the impact of the CPI on pricing. Do you expect the impact from CPI to change pricing as we move through the balance of 2015?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No. I don't think that we'll see a significant change in CPI. But when we look at our pricing programs, we try to look at them holistically, and if CPI is lower, then we just have to get those dollars from somewhere else. And so if we get a bump from CPI, that would be great. But if we don't get that bump, we're just going to have to pull those dollars from somewhere else, and that's what we've been doing the last few years, and that's what we'll do this year.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thanks, David. And then in the recycling business, I'm not sure if you mentioned this, but is there any EBITDA in that business right now?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Right now it's...", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, there's EBITDA because the depreciation. There's not a lot of EBIT", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, there's EBITDA. There's not much EBIT, yes. The impact of EBIT, income from operations was about negative $11 million year-over-year, Alex.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Okay. Got it. Got it. And then, just lastly, is there any visibility on potentially seeing a benefit from coal ash volumes, either towards the end of this year into 2016?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. We've got a nice contract that actually begins in the second half of the year. It's not going to be \u2013 it's not going to move the needle significantly, but it's a nice contract, a few million dollars. But we're having continuing discussions with all the various utilities and I'd expect that to be a nice volume stream for the next \u2013 gosh, for the next 5 years to 10 years.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Appreciate the color. I'll turn it over.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Certainly.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Levine of Imperial Capital.", "Scott J. Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "Hey. Good morning, guys.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Scott J. Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "So I just want to focus on \u2013 I think, Jim, you mentioned a 60-basis-point volume headwind from national accounts and Wal-Mart. To be clear, is that all associated with contract changes within the past 12 months? Were there any additional changes this quarter and then maybe a little bit more elaboration on your thoughts on that business in general going forward?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So, I'll take that and then maybe, Jim, you can add to that.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. So, for the quarter \u2013 and we expect \u2013 well, the Wal-Mart, that will anniversary in May, so we won't see that headwind, if you want to call it that. It's a headwind on the revenue line. It's not a headwind on the bottom line. But that will anniversary in May.", "We did lose some other contracts and some of them were intentional. Some of them were not intentional. We lost some due to aggressive pricing and it's a competitive marketplace for sure.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Jim, what I would just add to that is that we are also winning new contracts. We have won some business, some additional business from current customers, as well as some additional businesses that you'll see in future quarters. But that roll-forward effect from some of those large losses like Wal-Mart will continue through at least the first half of the year.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And when we look at that business from a philosophical point of view, look, we completely understand that sort of like the residential business, there's some stiff competition there. But particularly, where we can get that front-end small-container work that we can tuck right into our operations and create that route density, that's really the kind of work that we want to pick up. The compactor work like the Wal-Mart business is generally lower margin and it doesn't really help us from a route density point of view. And so, our focus will be on that small-container business but we're obviously going to remain competitive in national accounts and we'd expect to continue to be the biggest player.", "Scott J. Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "Got it. And just to be clear and strictly for modeling purposes, was Mal-Wart half of that 60 basis point volume impact or less than that or is it \u2013 just to make sure we model the volumes right for the rest of the year.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I think it was a little more than half, Scott.", "Scott J. Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "A little more than half. Got it. And then as my follow-up, I think you mentioned plans to repurchase stock to offset dilution, share dilution in the second quarter, just kind of are you still holding off on, call it the larger repurchase activity as you assess M&A prospects and maybe a little bit more elaboration on your thoughts on the acquisition landscape?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. No, that's exactly right. So, when we look at 2015, there's really two pieces to it. There's what I'd call sort of our normal recurring stock buyback. We generate a lot of free cash flow. A good portion of that goes back to our shareholders through the dividend and traditionally the remainder goes back to our shareholders through a share repurchase and some of it goes into small tuck-in acquisitions. In 2015 we're getting back to that and so what we're talking about doing in the second quarter, I would characterize as part of our sort of normal, recurring returning of cash to our shareholders.", "On the redeployment of the Wheelabrator proceeds, as we talk to sellers, it's sort of interesting. You've got really two things happening. You've got expectations of price multiples which are probably a little higher than we expected, but then you've also got some timing events, right? You've got private sellers that might have family or estate issues. And then you've got private equity sellers that might have funds that they want to hold for a number of years that have sort of a liquidation timeframe on them. And so what we're battling is price expectations and timing expectations.", "My guess is that, by midyear, we will know whether we can meet both timing and price expectations. If we can't do that, then we'll buy back stock. Now, that doesn't mean that we're not going to ultimately talk with those sellers and buy their business. If they have timing expectations that don't mature for a year or 18 months, we'll be talking to them in a year or 18 months, and we'll buy them as part of our normal acquisition process.", "And so, in the middle of the year, by sort of the end of the second quarter, we would expect to be in a position where we're going to make a call where we say, we will either buy those businesses with the proceeds or we'll buy back stock with the proceeds. And if we don't buy those businesses with the proceeds, you'll probably see us continue to look to buy them over the next couple years as their timing gets better.", "Scott J. Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "Got it. Thanks, David.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Certainly.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Box of KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, guys.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Joe.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "So, just a clarification on volume. Are we still thinking about volumes turning the corner later in the year and either flattening out on a total basis or even being up?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So, let's sort of look at those profitable components that we talked about before. On industrial, we actually saw volumes turn positive in April. They were only negative 0.5% in the quarter, and we actually saw them turn positive in April. So, I would expect that we would see positive volumes from the industrial side going forward.", "The landfill side has always been positive volume, but we would expect to see that get better as we get to the seasonal upturn. We had a little bit of a weather effect in the first quarter. So we'd expect to see those volumes improve.", "On the commercial side, again, we're 200 basis points better than we were in the first quarter of last year. We're 70 basis points better than we were in the fourth quarter. We would expect that sort of rate of improvement to continue, such that by the end of the year, I would expect that we'll be closer to flat on the commercial side. So, if you look at commercial being closer to flat, industrial and landfill being positive, I think that could lead to positive volumes by the end of the year in those three lines of business.", "Now, the headwinds you have are basically national accounts and the residential line of business. Those will be slight drags, but again, those are low-margin drags, so we're willing to live with those. So, when we look at the core solid waste business, the negative 1.2% that we had in the first quarter, we completely believe that by the end of the year, those will be flat to positive such that our guidance for the year of negative 0.5% to flat volumes is still valid.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Joe, when you think about how that volume that you talk about translates to top-line revenue, the way we looked at the quarter was when we looked at collection, disposal and transfer, the revenue was up fairly decently at about $25 million. And keep in mind, that's almost all organic. We really didn't have a lot in the way of acquisitions for the last 12 months, so up $25 million.", "The second factor, of course, was, as we've talked a lot about this morning, the negative revenue impact of recycle commodity prices and recycle volumes. And that was a negative $70 million. So \u2013 and then of course, the third factor, David just mentioned, fuel surcharge, FX, and we've talked about the lower \u2013 the lost Walmart contract and some of the lost national accounts business.", "But overall, the volume numbers that we \u2013 the improvement that we're seeing in some of those volume numbers on the core side is translating to top-line revenue. We weren't displeased with the $25 million in those three core businesses.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Well, actually, Jim, so to that point, maybe you can help me understand the disconnect here, if I just add up the numbers that I have for collection, disposal and transfer, acknowledging that there is some component that's going to go into intercompany, if I'm just adding it up, I'm coming up with a flat number versus last year. So are you stripping out FX to get to that $25 million? Are you stripping out fuel? What am I missing?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No, you're adding in price. When you look at it from a total revenue point of view, you've got to add the price in and as well as the volume component.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "I'm just looking at total revenues and a flat year-over-year.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "FX is not included in that $25 million. So I've broken it into a couple of different buckets which was our core solid waste, collection, disposal, transfer. Those, price and volume, excluding divestitures, was up $25 million...", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "...in revenue. And then the second factor was a negative $70 million in recycling. And the third factor was $36 million negative in fuel surcharge, $25 million negative in FX and $21 million negative in national accounts.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thanks for the clarification. So I'm just looking at the core solid waste business, and I'm curious, what are you specifically seeing that gives you the confidence that you can offset that incremental $0.05 to $0.07 headwind in recycling? Or is that just a moot point because you guys would prefer to address the guidance in 2Q?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No. I mean, look, we see \u2013 what I would tell you is that we're much more confident now that we're going to get the dollars that we expect to get from our pricing program. We continue to see good improvement on the cost side, both on the SG&A and on the operating cost side. And then, I'd say that we're probably a little more optimistic than we were at the beginning of the year from a volume perspective.", "Again, that's why this is a \u2013 it's an interesting quarter for us. When we first looked at the quarter and saw the revenue decline, we said, wow, what's going on? When we looked behind it, we say, we see some really good trends in our profitable lines of business. We can't help the fact that we're going to lose $70 million of revenue on the recycling side because of commodity prices, but when we look at our very profitable commercial, industrial landfill lines, we see some really positive trends there.", "And so \u2013 and that was \u2013 all those positive trends occurred even though we had some negative weather in the first quarter. So I would say that we're fairly bullish on the volume side. We're extremely confident on the price side and we think we'll get a little bit more out of our cost programs than we expected at the beginning of the year.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Got it. Thanks. One last one for me then. So why does recycling actually get worse as we move through the year sequentially? I mean, it seems like pricing is somewhat bottomed and comps should get easier, so why would the headwind actually get worse?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Well, the price actually \u2013 I'm not sure if the price is bottomed or not. It's as low as it's ever been, but we haven't seen any indication of a bottom. And so you've got some fairly tough comps in the second and third quarter, gets a little bit better in the fourth quarter.", "And then you've got the volume decline, right, the 8% volume decline. We don't expect to see that improve throughout the course of the year. And so, basically, it's mostly driven by commodity pricing, and I would tell you that we're being a little bit conservative on that because we just don't see any catalyst out there that's going to drive the commodity prices up significantly.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Joe, I think what you're probably thinking is why can't you just straight-line the $0.02 and come to $0.08. And the reason is that commodity prices dropped throughout the quarter. So we're looking at kind of straight lining from the commodity price in March, which was the lowest of the three months.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Got it.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. For the quarter, it was down 14%. For the month, it was down 24%. So, we're basically extrapolating that low price across the rest of the year.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. That clarification helps. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk of Wedbush Securities.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Good morning.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Al.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning, Al.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "I want to continue on recycling. Can you help us maybe appreciate, for lack of better word, the mix issue that you're dealing with, and then secondly, the contract structure issue that is probably a multi-year resolution to at the end of the day conclude that this macro theme that you set up for 20 million tons to handle recycled product still makes sense in the shareholders' mind?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. So, Al, a couple of things on the \u2013 first of all on the contracts and the mix issue. Each of these contracts has an expectation as to mix of commodities, and when that mix changes, we have to address that with the customer. So, for example, we've talked quite a bit about glass over the last couple of quarters. Glass is heavy, so the customers may like it. We don't like it as much. It's the only commodity that we don't get paid for on the back end, and we actually have to pay to get rid of it. And so as glass goes up, as an example, then we have to address that with a customer if there are limitations, mix limitations, within their contract.", "Similarly, if there are contamination level restrictions. So, for example, if a community has a restriction of 10% contamination levels, and when we go through an audit and find that there are 20%, then we have to recover some of that. So part of what we're doing through our recycling team is really taking a tough stance on holding customers to contracts on contamination levels and material mix.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Jim, I would that those two issues are absolutely related because some of the mix issues that are caused as cities and counties want to divert more waste, add to the contamination level in some of those commodities, and many of our older contracts don't allow us to charge. That's what we're changing. We're going in, some of them in mid-contract and having some success. Most of them, though, we'll wait until the contract ends until we can change the terms that allow us to get paid for their mix issue or their contamination issue.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "So, clearly, a multi-year undertaking here?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Look, there's two pieces to it. There is fixing the mix and contract issue, then it's fixing operations, right? I mean, we still have some opportunities to consolidate plants, to drive out some operating costs. And we think we can make some more headway there.", "Like Jim said, if it wasn't for the headway that we made in the first quarter, it would have been a \u2013 if you look just at the price component, it was a $0.05 problem. We still think we've got some operating costs that we can pull out. We're going to have to consolidate some plants and rationalize some assets.", "And I think that's what customers need to realize is that we're not the only ones rationalizing assets. The industry is rationalizing assets. And unless we can work out a way where recycling is profitable over the long term, there's not going to be recycling. And customers certainly don't want to live with that. So, we just need to make sure that the customers understand that if they want glass recycled, we need to get paid for it. We actually lose or we lost in the quarter $6 million by recycling glass. Long term that cannot be sustainable for Waste Management. So, we need to work with the customers to get them to understand the mix issues, to understand the commodity markets so that we can make a long term viable business out of recycling.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "But the progress to-date, David, has been slim. Is that because the major customers or your larger customers in this area are not ready to discuss until contract comes up...?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, exactly. Most of these contracts are long-term contracts and \u2013 look, it's a long-term contract; we signed the contract. We will live up to the contract. But what they need to realize is we'll live up to that contract, but we're not going to be there when the contract ends, and nobody's going to be there when the contract ends.", "So, if they want us to maintain the facilities that we have in those markets, we're going to have to get some relief from these contracts or we're going to just have to shutter the plants. And so, I would hope that customers would say, let's take a long-term view at it rather than a short-term view. But as you know, as we generate $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion of free cash, there's not a lot of sympathy for our losses in recycling.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Now, I wouldn't characterize the progress as slim. I think what's happened is it's been overshadowed by the real dramatic fall in commodity prices. Look, commodity prices were basically kind of \u2013 our average bucket of commodity prices was in the $100 range for the last two years, last two and a half years. $98 finished the year in 2014. And all of a sudden, it's gone from $98 to $82 and when we process between 6 million and 7 million tons a year, that's a big price decline to absorb. So, we've made some good progress on controlling cost and on kind of holding customers to contract but, man, with such a dramatic commodity price decline, it was hard to overcome it.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "So \u2013 but you're not able to maybe take a little more aggressive action yourself and walk away from these contracts?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, we're looking at everything, but it's hard to walk away from a contract at times.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Okay. I understand. The follow-up then, just a little bit more \u2013 David, your comments about capital deployment or redeployment of the Wheelabrator proceeds, it would seem to me that this is more a function of maybe some larger transactions that you're looking at than your traditional annual deals you're doing or even something of a Deffenbaugh size. Could you comment on that? And if that's not the case, then why wouldn't you be out in the market aggressively buying back stock particularly given today's reaction?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, exactly. Well, obviously, that gives us more opportunity to buy back more stock. And so you're exactly right. I mean, what we're looking at when we look at the Wheelabrator proceeds are looking at \u2013 we sort of look at it the exact same way. We say we want another three Deffenbaughs, right?", "And those are \u2013 there's not a lot of Deffenbaughs in the country. And once you find that type of business, you've got to overcome two hurdles. One, are they ready to sell? And two, what do they want? What's the price that they want to sell? And I would tell you that at the beginning of the year, we were pretty encouraged by what we saw on both of those fronts. As we've got into deeper discussions with sellers, we found out that some of them had bigger timing issues than we thought and some of them have higher pricing expectations than we thought.", "And so \u2013 look, that doesn't mean that we ultimately won't buy those businesses, but it might mean that it's going to take us longer to buy those businesses, and if that's the case, then we do need to be out in the market buying back our stock because, look, as I said, that's the business we know the best. We're never going to pay a multiple higher than our own multiple because there's one business we know real well and that's ours. And so I would guess that in the back half of the year, we will be in the market more than just to cover dilution, but if we can get to the point where we can get some of the sellers that we can meet their timing and their pricing expectations, we would obviously much prefer to buy good core solid waste businesses at reasonable prices.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Got it. Thank you.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Charles Redding of BB&T.", "Charles E. Redding - BB&T Capital Markets", "Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for talking my call.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "Charles E. Redding - BB&T Capital Markets", "On the industrial side, it certainly sounds like you're seeing improvement here. I guess as we look ahead, how do we rectify what looks to be slowing industrial production and a tough market for US exports with your expectation for stronger volume growth?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, it was mentioned earlier, you've got the coal ash coming, but you've also got a huge amount of construction being done along the chemical corridors, right, from Houston to Beaumont and up to Baton Rouge and up through Pennsylvania where you've got very low natural gas prices. You've got some huge projects being built. We expect to get good volumes out of that. And then when you look at the residential and commercial construction, those numbers look fairly strong.", "So we think that the economy is going to be finally a little bit of a help to us on that side. Now, remember, we also have a lot of those hauls in our energy services. We really haven't seen a dramatic drop on the energy services side. And so we've got well positioned in still some good shale plays there. So we see pretty positive trends throughout the various sectors that drive industrial hauls for us", "Charles E. Redding - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay. And then I guess just a little follow-up on Canada. I realize it's relatively fractional for you, but can you speak to perhaps what you're seeing there? And then I guess has the macro pullback had a material impact on the recent volume growth in the region?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I think it's kind of the tale of kind of two parts of the country. Western Canada is, particularly Alberta, is suffering a bit from the energy price decline. Eastern Canada seems to be reasonably strong, similar to kind of Northeast US is.", "Charles E. Redding - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my call.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Absolutely.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown of Raymond James.", "P. Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, guys.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "P. Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey. Just, Jim, can you help us out on the cadence of cash flow and just why Q1 was such a large working capital drag? I don't know if that was the cash taxes paid on Wheelabrator or if your cash conversion cycle creeped? And then maybe how do we think about the full-year impact of working capital in your cash from ops guidance?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So, a couple of things running through working capital worth mentioning here. First of all, our \u2013 you may recall that in \u2013 for our bonus payout, our annual incentive comp payout that would have paid out in March of 2014, we accelerated a piece of that into December of 2013. So it was a 2013 year annual incentive comp, but it was \u2013 a portion of it was paid out in 2013. We did not do that this year.", "So, we knew we were going to have a working capital negative headwind in March of this year, and that amounted to about $65 million. Most of that was that acceleration. A piece of it was just a higher payout from year 2014 versus year 2013. That was \u2013 totaled about $65 million as a headwind. We also had about $21 million in non-recurring, mostly non-recurring cash payout for the 2014 restructuring. We've got about $12 million left, and that will spread out over the next three quarters. But we had $21 million in Q1 that is for the most part non-recurring and that's a payout of our 2014 restructuring.", "And then, in addition to that, we had \u2013 in 2014, we had a benefit, a $36 million benefit from the settlement of a forward-starting swap that didn't repeat, of course, this year. So, when you think about year-over-year, the negatives were those. The positive was EBITDA was up. And then the other positives were that we continue to make headway on managing working capital on DSO and DPO, particularly DPO was up 2.1 days, DSO up 0.6 days. So, we're starting to narrow the gap pretty significantly there from a couple of years ago.", "P. Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. So, is working capital a drag in cash from ops guidance or is it neutral?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, I think working capital is certainly a drag in Q1. There will be some positives coming up as we look at the remainder of the year. So, for example, the San Jacinto settlement of last year, that won't repeat. And so that will be a tailwind for us on working capital.", "And as I mentioned, we shouldn't have those \u2013 that cash impact from the restructuring starts to taper off pretty dramatically in Q2. And of course, the bonus headwind from the incentive comp payouts, and the acceleration of that, that doesn't recur either.", "P. Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. And then follow-up here. I just want to understand CapEx just a little bit better. So, if I look at trailing 12 months CapEx, and if I even adjust for divestitures, you guys are about 8.5% of sales. I think there's a common convention or belief out there that you need to be north of, call it, 9% of sales on a pure maintenance basis. So, am I missing something there, or how do you bridge the gap, the differential in the CapEx?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "We've said that \u2013 we kind of gave a number of 8.3% to 9%. I think we gave that last year. First quarter is historically slow. We were \u2013 the number I had was 7.7% of revenue in the first quarter, and \u2013 but if I look at Q1 of 2014, it was 7.8%. If I look at Q1 of 2013, it was 7.9%. So not way out of range with those two years' first quarters.", "We expect that 2015 actually is going to be in that $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion range, which is a bit of a headwind for us in terms of free cash flow because, last year, we only spent $1.15 billion. So we're going to spend somewhere between $50 million and $150 million more in CapEx. And, clearly, on a percent of revenue, without the Wheelabrator assets, that will be a higher percentage of revenue. So, I think 2015, not only is it going to be higher in absolute dollars, it's going to be higher as a percent of revenue.", "P. Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. And then just maybe if I can squeeze one last in here, thinking about capital structure. But you guys have kind of swept some of the Wheelabrator proceeds, the net proceeds, I should say, maybe to Deffenbaugh. You had your note repayment. Maybe you've de-levered a little bit. But I've got you at about, call it, 2.7 on the leverage. You got $300 million in cash. So when we think about future capital deployment, is the idea that you would re-lever to do so? And if so, what is kind of the level of leverage you're willing to go to, or what's your kind of optimal capital structure?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. So if I think of us as being in kind of that 2.78 leverage ratio range, yeah, I would expect that to increase slightly as we acquire some businesses to replace Wheelabrator going forward.", "P. Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Perfect. Thanks.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman of Stifel.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thank you for taking my questions. So cold or allergies, David?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Allergies for me.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Poor thing. Jim, can we do a little bit of a waterfall to try and reconcile 2014 EPS and the guidance for 2015? If I understand everything you've given us, and thanks for the data, I should take $0.18 out of last year's number for all the divestments and then I need to take $0.10 out for recycling and $0.04 for currency and that kind of gives me a starting place, add in buybacks and then I get growth. That's the kind of how to \u2013 is that the right way to think about it?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. And there's some interest expense savings in there, too.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Interest expense would be a part of that. Okay. So getting back to the growth, then, aspect of this and then the solid waste side, and you may have given this data and I pardon, you were just \u2013 there was so much of it I'm not sure I got it all written down. But weight per yard trends in your front-end loader business had exited 2014 on a positive trend line. What's that trend line coming through the first half of the year at this point? And where does it sort of set in your mind about that cycle of service interval upgrades that create such operating leverage?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, Michael, when we look at the commercial line of business, I'll give you a few reasons why we're optimistic. First is you're right. The weights continued through the first quarter, we saw improvement there. We saw service increases exceed service decreases, so there's some good news there.", "But frankly, the best news that I've seen on the commercial line of business, we just went through reviews with our 17 market areas, and 12 of our 17 market areas had net positive new business in the first quarter. The other good part of that news is that over two-thirds of that new business was greenfield projects, new businesses that are created, not stealing share from somebody else. And so I think what you're seeing is a better secular trend, and what you're seeing is that we're taking advantage of that better secular trend.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. So following through with that then, on your C&D side of the business, on the pulls, what's the trend in absolute number of pulls and then revenue per pull, how's that trend look like?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. The revenue per pull is nicely improving. On the number of pulls, frankly, I don't have the actual number of pulls. I know what the percentage increase was. But you saw 10.9% volume in the landfill, and so I would assume that equates to a pretty healthy increase in the number of pulls.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I think it was down slightly in terms of revenue pulls which pretty much correlates to the volume number that we talked about, but it was down slightly, and part of that, as David mentioned early in the call, Michael, was in energy services. I mean you're down 50% in rigs. Fortunately, we were able to replace some of that revenue, so we're not down as much as the rig count, of course, but it did affect the hauling side of the business.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. So what I was really trying to get at too is, and you alluded to this to one other question, if I remember correctly, pretty much the whole industry assumed going into this year that residential construction would hold at about 1 million starts. Somebody was looking for it to be better, but so far, the data set would suggest that maybe that trend is better, one.", "And two, the non-residential construction ex oil and gas and energy broadly, if you will, power and oil and gas, which had been a positive into 2014. All of the other components, commercial, lodging, office and what have you, actually just struck a bottom in 2014 and started to turn a corner. Are you seeing that corner turn in both...?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I mean, look, I think that's exactly right, Michael. I mean, look, we're not going to call a dramatic turn, but I do think that we, for the first time in two years, we're willing to say that there is a good secular trend going on that we see continuing.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. All right. And then on the recycling side, if $98 was the number for blended commodities in December and $82 is 1Q, what's the blended commodity dollar number given the current cost structure of recycling business to be breakeven on an EBIT basis? What do you need that to be?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Breakeven is probably in the $78 to $80 range.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then, on free cash flow, when do I see working through the cash flow from ops? There's $200 million in non-recurring tax situation. When do I see that walk its way through? Is that spread out through the whole year or there's a tax filing in, I think, 2Q and 4Q? Is it a 2Q and 4Q issue?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. Well, we pay in all three quarters. We kind of make a double payment in Q2 and Q4. So, you'll start to see it in Q2 and it will carry through the rest of the year.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. So I should see a little bit of above average cash flow from ops as a percent of revenues in 2Q?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I mean none of that $210 million, Michael, showed up because we didn't make any federal tax payments in Q1.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Right. So, stripping that away and looking at the sort of recurring number, 1.2% to 1.3%, what do you think, based on what you're looking at the business today, the embedded recurring growth rate of that 1.2% to 1.3% would be as I look forward? Is that mid-single digits, high-single...?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think you're looking at basically sort of that 5% to 7% compounded growth rate.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. That's very helpful. And then two housekeeping questions just because I'm a little confused. On page 6 of your 8-K, you have a nice table...", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Michael, that's a little bit obtuse for us.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "What's that, page 6 of the 8-K?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Going to a specific page of the 10-K...", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Right. Sorry. But you have these great tables you've given, and you talk about landfill volume up, but the tons number you have in the document actually has it down versus a year ago. You were 21.3 a year ago, and you're 20.9. So, I'm trying to reconcile the script and the data that's in the document.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hey, Michael. That's all intercompany volume based. Our intercompany volume is down. Third-party volumes are up. That's the difference.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Perfect. That's great. And then as I think about the fuel, I mean, I had more cost saves than I did revs in 1Q, but I would assume that that gap narrows through the rest of the year, and it's less of \u2013 it's more of just a net offset to each other as I work through the year. That's a timing difference of the surcharge comes back slower than the savings hit?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, that's correct.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And I should try and just smooth that out through the remainder of the year and it kind of nets itself out by the end of the year?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Correct.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. That's all I needed. Thanks.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Michael.", "Operator", "I will now turn the call over to CEO, David Steiner, for closing remarks.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you. Well, obviously, we at Waste Management had a very good quarter. But when we look beyond Waste Management and look at the overall industry, as we said with Michael, we see improving industry fundamentals, with the pricing environment stable and the volume environment improving. So we look forward to capitalizing on those improving industry fundamentals and continuing to gain momentum throughout 2015 and into 2016. And with that, we'll see you next quarter.

Good morning from Houston. Our strong second quarter results reflect our continued commitment to disciplined core price growth and cost controls, combined with improving volumes, all positive trends that we expect to continue throughout the second half of the year.", "In the second quarter, we earned $0.67 per share, an increase of almost 16% from the second quarter of 2014, to excluding the earnings from divested businesses and assets. Our net income, operating income and margin, operating EBITDA and margin, and earnings per diluted share all improved when compared to the second quarter of 2014, despite year-over-year headwinds of $0.03 per diluted share from lower recycling commodity prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations.", "We also saw our business generates significant cash, as our cash provided by operating activities increased 47% and our free cash flow grew 30%. We are pleased with these results and we expect the positive momentum to continue to build through 2015 and into 2016.", "Our pricing programs continued to be a big part of our earnings growth and margin expansion and our strategy remains the same. Continue our focus on core price, while selectively adding the right new volumes.", "For the second quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.1% and yield was 1.7%. Year-to-date, through June core price was 4.3%, which exceeded our 2015 core price target of 3.8% and yield was 1.9%.", "As we said in the past, core price is a better indicator of true pricing activities, because mix issues can affect our yield results as we saw in the second quarter. As bottomline dollars that count in core price reflects the bottomline impact from pricing.", "So while we said that yield would be around 2% of the year, we are not concerned with the slight drop in yield as the absolute dollars to the bottomline from pricing remained on track and our core price remains robust.", "Over the last six quarters, core price has been consistently over 4%. In the second quarter we saw core price improved 10 basis points from the second quarter of 2014. When compared to the second quarter of 2014 core price in the industrial line was 8.6%, in the commercial line it was 5.8%, 2.1% in our residential line and 2.3% in our landfill line.", "As we saw in the first quarter, core price continues to drive margin expansion as our traditional solid waste business operating EBITDA margin increased 40 basis points. So pricing efforts are right on track and we expect that to continue in an improving volume market.", "With respect to volumes, we look at our traditional solid waste business volumes, which excludes recycling and non-unit or non-solid waste revenues. Our traditional solid waste business declined 0.6% in the second quarter of 2015 versus a decline of 2.3% in the second quarter of 2014, 170 basis point year-over-year improvement and a 60 basis point sequential improvement from the 1.2% decline in the first quarter of 2015.", "Overall volumes which includes recycling and those non-solid waste volumes declined 1.3% in the second quarter, compared to the negative 3% reported in the first quarter of 2015, a sequential improvement of 170 basis points.", "Although, overall volumes continued to be negative, we saw some positive signs in the second quarter. In our industrial line of business we had very strong new business pricing, yet volume was 270 basis points improved year-over-year, improving from negative 2.7% to flat in the second quarter 2015, which reflects a robust market.", "We also saw the rate of decline in our commercial line of business improved again, as the rate of loss in commercial volumes improved 280 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2014 and 60 basis points sequential, from a negative 2.8% in the first quarter of 2015 to a negative 2.2% in the second quarter 2015, and the momentum improved throughout the quarter, with June showing better volumes than April and May.", "We also saw service increases exceed decreases in the quarter. Finally, new business in our commercial and industrial lines combined exceeded loss business for the first time in three years.", "So we are predicting a dramatic and fast turn to positive volumes, but we continue to see the light at the end of the volume tunnel and we would expect volumes to strengthen through the rest of 2015 and into 2016.", "Turning to recycling, as you heard us saying many times, the current recycling model is broken and we and the entire industry need to fix it. We have seen progress in our recycling operations, but the issues are complex and it\u2019s not an overnight fix. ", "We are also working together with our customers, vendors and industry groups, and we have made progress as we are finding some acceptance for better contract terms and higher fees to offset the higher processing costs that we are experiencing.", "We are working with customers and municipalities on educating the public on what and how to recycle to bring down contamination levels and on the true cost of recycling. We and our entire industry realize that recycling is the right thing for our customers and the environment. We need to make sure that it\u2019s not only the right thing to do, but it\u2019s also a sustainable business.", "Moving to current results from our recycling operations, in the second quarter we had a $0.02 decline in earnings per share compared to the second quarter of 2014. This decline is due to the more than 13% drop in average commodity prices for the quarter and a 5.7% decline in volumes associated with contractual losses as we shed unprofitable volumes.", "Our recycling employees continued to perform at high levels, working to reduce operating costs. In the second quarter, operating costs continued to improve as we saw an 8% improvement in our operating cost per ton compared to 2014. We expect to continue to see improvements in the second half of the year, but low commodity prices will continue to be a challenge.", "With respect to the deployment of our free cash flow from operations in our Wheelabrator divestiture we will continue to seek a balanced approach to buying solid waste businesses, repurchasing shares and maintaining the strong yield through our dividend.", "With respect to acquisitions, we believe that in 2015 we can execute agreements to add an additional $50 million to $75 million of operating EBITDA. We would likely close those acquisitions in 2016.", "In the second quarter, we repurchased $300 million of our outstanding shares and we will repurchase an additional $300 million in the third quarter, because I had a 10b5-1 trading plan in place, in the second quarter I personally purchased $2 million worth of Waste Management shares.", "In the fourth quarter we will determine if we have additional acquisition candidates likely to occur or if we want to deploy cash to repurchase shares. And of course, we will continue to maintain a strong dividend and a strong balance sheet.", "In conclusion, we're pleased with the strong results to the first half of 2015. When we combine the first half results with our outlook for continued price and cost control discipline and improving volumes, we are confident that we can achieve our full year guidance.", "We now expect that our 2015 adjusted earnings per diluted share should be at the high-end of our previously announced guidance of between $2.48 and $2.55 per share, despite negative headwinds to diluted earnings per share of between $0.07 and $0.10 from recycling operation, and about $0.04 from the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments. We also expect to achieve the upper end of our free cash flow guidance of between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion.", "So the year is playing out pretty much as we expected, but our people are doing what they need to do to offset the recycling and currency headwind. Their efforts have been extraordinary and on behalf of the entire senior leadership team we thank them for their excellent.", "I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our second quarter results in more detail.", "Jim Fish", "Thank you, David. In the second quarter of 2015 our focus on reducing SG&A costs continues to bear a fruit. Overall, SG&A cost declined $31 million, compared to the second quarter of 2014.", "When you adjust 2014 for the operations that we divested, our year-over-year SG&A cost improvement was $18 million consistent with our expectations for savings from our reorganization.", "As percent of revenue, SG&A costs were 9.7%, an improvement of 40 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2014. With the strong results in the first half of 2014, we expect to achieve our full-year SG&A goals of reducing SG&A cost by $60 million.", "Turning to cash flow for the second quarter, net cash provided by operating activities was $816 million compared to $555 million in the second quarter of 2014, an improvement of $261 million, with a reduction in cash taxes accounting for $216 million of the increase. Free cash flow was $579 million in the second quarter of 2015, an increase of $245 million when excluding free cash flow from operations divested in 2014.", "Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $296 million, $88 million more than the second quarter 2014 as a portion of our expected increased fleet spend occurred in the second quarter. Excluding the cash tax benefit, free cash flow grew almost 9% compared to the second quarter 2014, despite an increase in capital spending.", "Given the level of expenditures in the first half of 2015, we expect capital expenditures to be at the high-end of our guidance range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. Despite that, free cash flow for 2015 is also expected to be at the high end of our guidance range of between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion.", "Second quarter revenues were $3.3 billion. We saw $54 million increase revenues from acquisitions and $34 million increase in our traditional solid waste business. The overall revenue decline stemmed from $193 million decline from divestitures, a $59 million decline from lower recycling revenues, $45 million in lower fuel surcharge revenues and $27 million in foreign currency fluctuations.", "Looking at internal revenue growth in the second quarter, our collection in disposal core price was 4.1% with total volumes declining 1.3%. This led to total company income from operations growing $12 million, operating income margin expanding 60 basis points, operating EBITDA growing $11 million and operating EBITDA margin growing 80 basis points. These results were strong and that much more encouraging when you consider about $30 million benefits we realized in the second quarter of 2014 that did not repeat in 2015.", "Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefit of the price volume trade-off. As David said our internal -- our industrial core price was 8.6%, our commercial core price was 5.8% and residential achieved 2.1% core price. In addition to the continued strong momentum in pricing, we saw some positive momentum in volume.", "Commercial volumes were down 2.2% in the second quarter of 2015 versus a decline of 5% since 2014, a 280 basis point improvement. Industrial volumes improved 270 basis points from a negative 2.7% in the second quarter of 2014 to flat in 2015. And outside of energy services, our industrial volumes were positive.", "Residential volumes declined 3.6% in the second quarter of 2015 versus a decline of 3.8% in 2014. The residential line of business remains competitive and we remain focused on retaining and growing where our internal investment is accretive to shareholders. This core price in volume led to income from operations growing more than $3 million and margin expanding 30 basis points and operating EBITDA growing more than $8 million and margin expanding 70 basis points.", "In the landfill line of business, we saw the benefits of both positive volume and positive core price in the second quarter. We saw same-store average MSW rates increase year-over-year for the ninth consecutive quarter, up 1.4% from Q2 2014. Combined special waste and revenue-generating cover volumes were positive 4.3%, MSW volumes grew by 7.2% and C&D volume grew 7.3%. Total landfill volumes increased 3.2%. This led to income from operations growing $9 million and operating margin grew 70 basis points. Operating EBITDA grew $16 million and margin expanded 140 basis points.", "Moving to operating expenses. As a percent of revenue, operating costs improved 60 basis points to 63.6%. Lower diesel costs and lower recycling commodity rebates to our customers improved by $68 million. Labor and related benefits improved $21 million when compared to the second quarter of 2014 as we continue to see the improvement of our service delivery optimization program.", "These savings were partially offset by increased disposal costs related to our improved volumes and an increase in risk management cost. Overall operating cost improved $56 million in second quarter after adjusting for the divestitures.", "Finally, looking at our other financial metrics. At the end of the second quarter, our debt to total capital ratio was 62.7% and our weighted average cost of debt is 4.4%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 9% at the end of the quarter. In the second quarter, we repurchased 6.1 million of our outstanding shares for $300 million and paid $175 million in dividends. The $475 million reflects our confidence in the cash generation of our business and commitment to return cash to our shareholders.", "Our income tax rate in the second quarter was 29.6%. Adjusting for items excluded in our as adjusted results, tax rate was 30.9%. In the second quarter 2015, a reduction in deferred taxes and utilization of state net operating loss -- losses benefited earnings per share by $0.02.", "In summary, our second quarter results continue to show the momentum that we saw in the first quarter and positions us well to achieve our full-year guidance. This would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of all of our employees. And for that, I want to thank them. For more than halfway through the year, we were very confident that we\u2019ll have a successful year.", "With that, Janisha, let\u2019s open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Corey Greendale of First Analysis.", "Corey Greendale", "Hey good morning.", "David Steiner", "Hey Corey.", "Jim Fish", "Hey Corey.", "Corey Greendale", "Just a few questions. So, first of all, I appreciate the update on progress and some of your discussions on the structure of your recycling contracts. Just wondering, given that commodity prices have come off the bottom somewhat, is that impacting those conversations or customers' willingness to engage in changes?", "David Steiner", "No, really the prices haven\u2019t come up the bottom. I mean, to the extent they have come up the bottom. It\u2019s been very marginal. So we\u2019re still relatively close to sort of breakeven when it comes to processing cost versus commodity sales. So no, the impact if anything I think the discussions have become more pronounced with the customer. And I think more and more as you see, more folks like you all in the financial community and more folks in the general press understanding the issues facing recycling. I would say those issues are more and more coming to the front rather than going back.", "Jim Fish", "Corey, when you look at the weighted average commodity prices, it was about $83 in Q1 and $83 in Q2. So really the improvement we\u2019re seeing is through our cost efforts on cost of good sold and operating cost.", "Corey Greendale", "Okay, yes, it is more -- at least the numbers I have seen, it is more in July that came more meaningfully off the bottom, but I'm looking at OCC and newsprint primarily, so maybe the\u2026", "David Steiner", "Yeah. OCC seems to have stabilized a little bit but still at low levels.", "Corey Greendale", "Okay. Then the next question, David, clearly the tenor on the volume environment is getting increasingly positive. I just want to make sure I am hearing you correctly. I think you are saying you would expect volumes to get kind of increasingly less negative each quarter in the back half, but you are not necessarily calling for it to go positive, but just want to clarify that?", "David Steiner", "Yeah. And you know what we're trying to do in order to give you even a little bit more clarity is to separate it between, what we\u2019re calling sort of our core solid waste volumes than overall volumes. And so when we look at it, we look at those core solid waste volumes which were negative 0.6% in the quarter. And we would expect that to improve in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter so that, look, we are not going to try to predict a turn to positive volumes, we said this year that we didn't think volumes were going to get positive. But I would expect us by the end of the year to be at a run rate where we\u2019re actually flat to positive on volumes.", "Corey Greendale", "Okay, great. And then a question on the free cash flow, I am just trying to understand the moving pieces, particularly related to cash tax payments. I think last year you had a $210 million hit from early payment of taxes and net benefits this year. Can you clarify is that the right number? Have we already seen that whole benefit? And what should we expect in free cash flow breakout between Q3 and Q4?", "Jim Fish", "Yeah. So that\u2019s right $210 million was kind of the early payments in Q4 of last year. So we kind of backed out $216 million to get to a number where we think that's for the year. And particularly, by the way when you look at cash from operations and free cash flow, both of those, if you normalize those for those taxes and if you normalize free cash flow for CapEx, we\u2019re in a position where we've actually overcome the WTI divestiture which is pretty amazing in and of itself.", "For the remainder of the year, if you tackle on what we think was -- is achievable which was last year -- last year's cash flow from operations and essentially that\u2019s what we did for the first two quarters, if you tack that on and that\u2019s what we\u2019re forecasting, then you get to a number that's in $1.5 range for free cash flow.", "Corey Greendale", "And Jim, without asking for kind of operational guidance for 2016, if you just look at movement in cash taxes, would you expect that free cash flow would be up in \u201816 or could it be down because of a movement in cash taxes?", "Jim Fish", "Yeah. If I take our guidance for this year at $1.5 and I normalize that for the cash tax benefits and CapEx a little bit. It's hard to say exactly what CapEx is going to be next year. I get to a pretty good starting point of about 13.5 to 14.0. Not that we\u2019re going to give you a lot of guidance, just yet.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey of Goldman Sachs.", "Usha Guntupalli", "This is actually Usha Guntupalli on for Alex. How are you?", "David Steiner", "Good morning. Doing well.", "Usha Guntupalli", "Great. One more question on recycling, assuming commodity prices stay flat at current levels, you are obviously working on reducing costs in this business, but when you expect the business to turn earnings positive at current commodity prices?", "David Steiner", "Yeah. We\u2019re earning in positive actually at current prices. Just slightly EBIT positive and certainly positive from an EBITDA point of view. So we didn\u2019t lose money in recycling in the quarter. We just did $0.02 worse than we did last year. So it\u2019s a year-over-year comparison. So we are slightly EBIT positive but certainly not EBIT positive enough to earn our return on capital, to earn our weighted average cost of capital. So that's why we\u2019ve got to get those earnings up.", "Usha Guntupalli", "Got it. That's helpful. And on the yield, yield seemed to have slowed in the second quarter and you did mention part of it was just mix. Could you give us more color on what was driving that mix?", "David Steiner", "Yeah. When you look at yield versus core price, it's why quite a while ago we started talking more about core price because really core price is what drives dollars to the bottom line. When we look at yield, there's a lot of different factors that can play into that. I will let Jim talk about a few of the ways that yield can -- I guess the point is that yield is indicative of pricing, but it's really sort of directional whereas core price is truly indicative of what's going on in our pricing programs. But I will let Jim talk a little bit about difference between yield and core price.", "Jim Fish", "Yeah. I think probably a good example of that is our Energy Services business. Typically that business has a longer, quite a bit longer length of haul than our ordinary business. So, due to that longer length of haul that business has a higher unit price and a higher yield, but not a higher core price or profitability per unit. So as the Energy Services business has slowed due to the falling oil prices, we've seen a decline in yield but not a decline in core price or unit profit.", "Jim Trevathan", "Dave and Jim, you also mentioned that we improved in the new business side on a net basis. When we add new business in markets that have a lower average unit rate, not a lower profitability measurement or lower margin, but a lower average unit rate and that's what happened in Q2. And/or we lose business in markets with higher or lower average unit rates, that effects yield and that\u2019s what happened in Q2. But it has no effect on margin or core price.", "David Steiner", "Yeah. You can imagine, just to sort of put some color around what Jim Trevathan said. You can imagine that right now there is a lot of growth in Texas and Texas has lower landfill rates than you have in the Northeast and hence you\u2019ve got a little bit lower pricing but you also have very high profitability. So it's not a profitability issue. It is just the fact that because you have lower landfill pricing in Texas than you do in the Northeast, you'll have lower unit cost and unit pricing for when you offer new services. And so as you\u2019ve seen more growth in places like Texas where it's very profitable, but it is just a lower unit rate versus the Northeast, that's what drives sort of those mix issues.", "And so when we look at that, we say okay, the yield is down but profitability is up. That\u2019s not such a bad thing. And that's why we say really what you have to look at is overall across our entire business what are we doing from a price increase point of view because price increases takes mix out of the mix. And so core price is really the true indication of what we're doing. And as you saw with core price of 8.6% industrial and 5.8% in commercial, it's still running at a pretty hefty rate.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Box of KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Joe Box", "Hey. Good morning, guys.", "David Steiner", "Good morning, Joe.", "Joe Box", "I just want to review the capital deployment strategy post Wheelabrator. Obviously, you guys have Deffenbaugh under your belt and I know you have got $50 million to $75 million of EBITDA lined up from deals that are going to go next year. Just curious if you have gotten all the deals done that you\u2019ve expected, because externally it looks like or it seems like that you guys are shooting for more deals when you sold Wheelabrator. And then just as a quick follow-up to that, the items that you lined -- the items that you mentioned in the pipeline, are those solid waste companies or are they outside of solid waste?", "David Steiner", "Yeah. When we are looking at companies, they are all going to be solid waste. We really wouldn't look to stretch outside of, sort of our core business when we are doing acquisitions. The acquisition -- you always think that you are going to have this money to spend. There is plenty of people out there to sell and it should be fairly easy to replace the EBITDA.", "And then once you get into the market, you realize there's a hundred different issues that affect sellers, right, sometimes their family businesses. And it's hard to get the family over. Sometimes there's higher expectations for pricing. And so when we went into it, we said look, if we can replace the Wheelabrator EBITDA at good accretive multiples, we will do it.", "The good news for us is, if we can\u2019t, we can still buy back stock and it would still be accretive to where we were with Wheelabrator. So, we were sort of in a win-win situation. And rather than run out sort of in undisciplined manner just pay whatever we needed to pay to replace the Wheelabrator EBITDA, we decided to take a little bit more of a disciplined approach, focus on our core solid waste business and see if we can't go out and do deals that are nicely accretive for our shareholders.", "And so what we like to, when we prefer to buy businesses that replaced the EBITDA rather than buying back shares, sure we would because that's a little bit more accretive for our shareholders. But we\u2019ve got to maintain our discipline on pricing and we\u2019ve got to realized that sometimes these acquisitions have to brew for a little while before they're ready and sellers have to come around to the fact that they're ready to sell. And so we certainly think that overtime, we will replace that roughly $200 million of EBITDA from Wheelabrator. It\u2019s just not going to happen overnight.", "Jim Fish", "And Joe, as I said earlier to Cory's question, we've kind of afforded ourselves the luxury of really being disciplined here because we really have. If you look at our second quarter, you look at our net cash from property activities and you back out the cash tax benefit, we are $45 million in second quarter of last year and that quarter includes all the divested businesses. So on the net cash from operating activities line and on the free cash flow line as well, you\u2019ve got to normalize the free cash flow for CapEx.", "But on both those lines, we have essentially replaced Wheelabrator and Puerto Rico and Maritimes and really the only acquisition we've done is Deffenbaugh and we\u2019ve had in the company for a quarter now. So what we will do in terms of capital allocation is continue to opportunistically buyback shares thing here, which we did in Q2 and again in Q3. And look to use those proceeds to buy companies at attractive prices.", "Joe Box", "Got it. Thanks for the color on that. Switching gears over to the New York City contract, I know it potentially is coming a little bit closer. Can you guys maybe just talk to what your current contracts are? I know you guys have some transfer stations in the market, and maybe talk about if you are participating in the new RFP and how you sit in that market.", "David Steiner", "Yeah. Joe, I will address the bid that\u2019s out now, the RFP that\u2019s out. We have provided a proposal for that volume. We are on the shortlist along with Progressive. It appears the city has begun discussions with Progressive and we are awaiting what the next steps are. Progressive, as you remember, was incumbent for that volume. And what happens to I guess will occur over the third and fourth quarter. We still have the transfer stations employees receiving volume from the New York City and a couple of those big transfers, Joe and nothing has changed with regard to that volume.", "Operator", "You next question comes from the line of Scott Levine of Imperial Capital.", "Scott Levine", "Hey. Good morning, guys.", "David Steiner", "Good morning.", "Scott Levine", "So, just looking back at your initial guidance for this year, I think, assumed a $0.03. $0.05 year-over-year hit from recycling. And obviously your current guidance is assuming much more than that and I'm guessing, a little bit bigger hit from FX. So, really just trying to get a sense, you are guiding to the upper end of the range here. Where is the upside versus your initial expectations coming from to more than offset the greater headwinds in recycling and FX?", "David Steiner", "Yeah. It is really coming sort of across the board, right. On the volume side, although the actual percentage decline in the volumes isn't as good as we thought it would be, frankly. The flow through that we are getting from the new volumes is better than we thought it would be. And so the point is that we are getting the right volumes. We've consistently fit or beat our targets on our SG&A numbers and on our operating costs.", "And so really, it's what I've said is that everything that we\u2019ve got going on from an operational point of view seems to be working other than recycling. And then obviously, we've got the interest savings and share count going down from the share buyback and that\u2019s benefiting the year. And so when we look at our business, we'd say everything is sort of clicking on all cylinders other than recycling. And so what is it that we can do to fix recycling. That's like we said, that\u2019s a long-term issue but we're making good progress on it.", "Scott Levine", "Thanks. And to be clear, is there -- and I don't know if you mentioned this -- is there a tax rate assumption implicit in your guidance for this year now or has that changed at all or no?", "David Steiner", "For the remainder of the year, I would assume that, that will be at 35% and that's what we\u2019ve baked into the guidance.", "Scott Levine", "Got it, 35%. Okay. And then as a follow-up, I think, David, you mentioned that the acquisitions you are contemplating here in the back half, into 2016, are all solid waste. Just wanted to confirm that's right, and just to see if your thoughts had changed in any way regarding the energy waste business in particular, and/or industrial waste since we've had the breakdown in commodity prices and the landscape has changed so dramatically?", "David Steiner", "Yes. What we are looking in the back half of the year is most certainly solid waste assets. When you look at things like Energy Services, we are going to be a player anytime, one of those transactions becomes available. We think long-term that a good space to be. Clearly, short-term it has some challenges and so you've got to look at it from a long-term valuation point of view, recognizing that short-term valuation might not be what the sellers are trying to sell it on. So, we will play in every one of those bids, but we're not going to -- look, everybody wants to get paid based on when things were blowing and going and they say, well, this is just the short downturn.", "We are not going to make that assumption. When we look at it, we are going to make an assumption on where we think the business is going to go over the next 5 to 10 years and we are going to evaluate accordingly. So, we haven't bought anything new in the oilfield service space because seller expectations on price haven\u2019t come down as much as our view of value. So, I would expect that if you look at what we are going to buy over the next year, it will be focused primarily on solid waste.", "Scott Levine", "And what are sellers' expectations there in general? Is that market kind of more rational in your view than oil services or not?", "David Steiner", "Yes. I mean, look, we\u2019ve always said that for us it\u2019s pretty simple on the solid waste side. If you assume that our long-term multiple is somewhere around eight times, right. It\u2019s been higher than that. It\u2019s been lower than that. But let\u2019s call our sort of long-term view of our multiple at eight to nine times EBITDA. Why would I pay someone more than eight times EBITDA when I can buy a business I know really well, our own business at eight times EBITDA.", "And so, look, we have lost a lot of deals right out of a shoot because sellers are expecting 10 to 12 times EBITDA and that\u2019s just a number that doesn\u2019t work with our model. So could we buy more businesses? Absolutely, but we\u2019d be buying those businesses at very high multiples, which obviously reduces the benefit to our shareholders.", "And so we will continue to look to those deals that we can buy pre-synergies at eight times or less, and then post-synergies hopefully at sort of as we\u2019ve always said 5.5 to 6 times EBITDA. If we can do that, we are pretty much guaranteed that come hell or high water, it\u2019s going to be accretive to our shareholders.", "Scott Levine", "Got it.", "Jim Fish", "I think kind of the opportunity landscape here in terms of what sellers are looking for is pretty broad. I mean, there is some folks that are looking for and in some cases getting 12 to 15 times. We are not in -- we are not talking to those folks, but there are folks that are much more reasonable and obviously Deffenbaugh was one that we felt we got at a very attractive multiple. And so we will continue to talk to companies like them.", "Scott Levine", "Got it. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk of Wedbush Securities.", "David Steiner", "Good morning, Al.", "Al Kaschalk", "Good morning. David or Jim, I just wanted to clarify on these deals that you\u2019ve laid out, 50 to 75, are these close? Are we at the goal line, or are these things that still have a few hurdles to get over? I am just questioning what put this type of color there today.", "David Steiner", "Yes. Well, so I am going to define the goal line for you, Al. There is really two goal lines. There is getting a deal signed. And then the second goal line is getting a deal approved by the government. And getting the deals signed is a pretty simple process.", "For some reason, the government has been taking a long time. I mean, look, you saw our Kansas City deal and it took them eight months to approve a deal where we weren\u2019t even in the market, right. And so it didn\u2019t seem like it should take that long to approve it. And it took a very long time for the government to approve it.", "Now they\u2019ve got a lot of big deals in the pipeline at Department of Justice and FDC. And so I assume that\u2019s what\u2019s causing the delays. And so what I would tell you is the first goal line is getting the deals signed up. The second is regulatory approval. We will be past that first goal line very short term.", "As far as getting the deals signed up, we\u2019re pretty much there. And so now the question is, how long is it going to take us to get those deals approved and what constraints will we have around getting those deals approved? And that\u2019s just such a wildcard that that\u2019s why we wanted to let you all know, we pretty much got this deal signed up for $50 million to $75 million of EBITDA, but now we got to get it across the regulatory goal line, the due diligence goal line. There is as you know from signing to closing is complicated not only from a business and due diligence point of view, from a government point of view. So we are pretty much past the first goal line. We are now marching towards that second goal line.", "Jim Fish", "And that second goal line Al is that\u2019s not an easy one to get over, right. We had a deal recently where we had agreed. We crossed the first goal line. We had agreed on purchase price months ago, but the HSR process was daunting enough for these folks that they just decided for now we are going to back away.", "So we both agreed to a -- what we both agreed was a reasonable purchase price, but we just felt like that second goal line was not going to be achievable at least in the near term. So we decided to part ways for now.", "Al Kaschalk", "Okay. So it sounds like this is multiple, several acquisitions as opposed to a single transaction.", "Jim Fish", "Yes. Well, the $50 million to $75 million that we\u2019re talking about is comprised of one larger transaction that would generate the bulk of that and then obviously some smaller bolt-on.", "Al Kaschalk", "Okay. David, I want to push back on the volume comments here. The stock got absolutely crushed after Q1 and the number that you put up. I don't know if it was 2.6 or 2.8, pardon me for not recalling that. And you had articulated as a company getting towards that 50 basis points down to flat exiting, I believe exiting '15.", "So can you maybe just put a little better -- refine the sequential trends here? And in particular, is this -- this was an overall volume comment, or was it specific to solid waste about the volume trend?", "David Steiner", "Yes. It was specific to solid waste, but let me put some sort of color around where we see the volumes going for the back half of the year. So let\u2019s start out with our industrial volumes. Our industrial volumes were flat for the quarter and the only reason they were flat is because energy services obviously is down. So when you look at the rest of the business, industrial is actually positive.", "So when you look at what we would look at before we got into the energy services business as sort of our core solid waste business, industrial volumes are actually positive. And we don\u2019t see anything on the horizon that would start that momentum. And so even with energy services down, they are flat. So we would expect those volumes to turn positive in the third or fourth quarter.", "Looking at the commercial volumes for the quarter, they were down 2.2%. Now that\u2019s a 60 basis point improvement from the first quarter. We would sort of expect that rate of improvement to continue. And so if you see that rate of continuum -- rate of improvement continue by the back half of the year, you are sort of at that negative, call it negative 1% on commercial volumes.", "Residential volumes were down, let\u2019s call it down 3%, 3.1%, but we don\u2019t really honestly even look at residential volumes, because when we\u2019re losing those volumes, they are generally low profit, very low margin volumes. And so we are not that concerned about losing those volumes. And then the land bill continues to be very strong.", "So when I look at volumes for the back half of the year, I look at volumes, I am looking at the volumes that would make us money, right. And when you look at the volumes that make us money, it\u2019s industrial, commercial landfill. Industrial is going to be positive. Landfill is going to continue to be positive. And commercial is going to get better.", "And so when I look at that, when I look at those three components of the volume, I\u2019d say look the rest is all just noise. As Jim talked about when you are getting, when you are passing through transportation to your customer and you charge your customer $100 for transportation, they pay you $100 and it costs you a $100, you make no margin on it. I don\u2019t care if I have that kind of revenue or not. And so when I look at the revenues that actually make us money, we see some really good trends and we expect those to continue in the back half of the year.", "Jim Fish", "Al, I would add one thing there which is recycle volumes. And I will give you an example. We had a plant that, big plant that that\u2019s essentially cut their volumes in half and by doing that, they improved the quality of the material coming in.", "They went from call it $0.5 million of month loss to breakeven by doing that. So that\u2019s similar to the resi volume. And that yes, we lost volume on the recycling line of business, but not a bad thing for us on the income statement.", "Al Kaschalk", "Right. Okay. My final question, I want to ask about this whole capital allocation. And question why, I guess, you lay out -- by the way, is the share repurchase either open market transactions versus an accelerated share repurchase?", "Jim Fish", "Al, we haven\u2019t made a final call on that, but we didn\u2019t accelerate share repurchase in the first quarter. And I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we did one in the second.", "Al Kaschalk", "Okay. I guess to that end, David, why quantify a certain -- one quarter out, a share repurchase program target versus you are in it for the long haul here, and as well as shareholders are, to just not maybe specifically allocate capital to those markets so that you can give yourself some flexibility to either execute on M&A, maybe the stock gets hit, maybe it doesn't?", "David Steiner", "I think that\u2019s a great point. And where we are right now is we are still sort of the in the -- what I would call the final stages of replacing that Wheelabrator EBITDA. I will tell you that as Jim point out, we basically replaced it through operations, that obviously takes a lot of pressure off of our need to do acquisitions. But we want to see what we can get put together in the back half of the year from an acquisition point of view so that then we can make that long-term call on where we\u2019re in share repurchases.", "So I would expect that when we give guidance for 2016, we will be able to say okay here is what our expectations for acquisitions and here is what our expectations for long-term share repurchases and approach to the dividend. And so I would say that in 2000 -- at beginning of 2016 after we sort of went through the market and determine what we can buy and what we can\u2019t buy that we would be able to give you a more long-term view of share repurchases.", "Al Kaschalk", "But to be fair, David, I think you said earlier this year that by the end of Q2, you would kind of know -- I guess you're asking for an extension from the outsiders looking in, because I think you said earlier this year that by the end of Q2 you would have an idea what the M&A would look like to execute here.", "David Steiner", "I am asking for an extension, but I am telling that -- but I am saying that yes, but like I said earlier, you go into this process thinking well this is going to be simple. There is a bunch of sellers out there that want to sell in and we are buyer, and this should line up fairly easily. And at the beginning of the year, it absolutely lined up easily. Jim talked about a transaction that if we had done the transaction Jim was talking about, we\u2019d pretty be have replaced the Wheelabrator EBITDA and we\u2019d be moving on and telling you what our long-term share repurchases are.", "It\u2019s only been in the last month where that the risk of HSR was too much for the seller to take on, and so we pushed that aside. And so I am not looking for an extension, I am just saying that it\u2019s a fluid process, it\u2019s not a one-time event. And it didn\u2019t play out as fast as we would have liked it to play out. And so the back half of the year is going to continue to be a little bit more fluid and then we can get more certainty going into 2016.", "Al Kaschalk", "Yes. But I guess you\u2019re playing a little analyst earlier in terms of eight times, nine times on what you\u2019re trading at. And if you are down now with the stock price where it's at the level, it sure would seem to make a lot more sense to buy back stock than to chase M&A. But I certainly understand the need to grow back the EBITDA level. But I think in looking at what the realization is on asset valuations out there, it looks pretty attractive at eight times here.", "David Steiner", "Yes, absolutely. Well, look, you\u2019re talking to the person that put $2 million of his own dollars into the stock, so I certainly thought it was attractive.", "Al Kaschalk", "Great. Thank you, David.", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown of Raymond James.", "Tyler Brown", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "David Steiner", "Good morning, Tyler.", "Tyler Brown", "Jim, so if we could just go back quickly to free cash flow, and you gave some really good color, but I do need a little clarification. So if you assume that the cash tax normalizes, I think you noted kind of run rate base of 1.35, but does that incorporate this $50 million to $75 million of EBITDA that you have kind of lined up?", "David Steiner", "It does not. So that is just growth on top of it.", "Tyler Brown", "Okay.", "David Steiner", "So what I\u2019m coming up with at 1.35 is really normalizing. And by the way, what we'll do is I didn\u2019t want to give 2016 guidance, so I kind of gave you a starting point there 1.35 to 1.40.", "Tyler Brown", "Exactly. Okay. So then, you would add on kind of acquisitions, maybe some rollover of Deffenbaugh, and kind of whatever your growth is in the core business, plus or minus the other stuff?", "David Steiner", "That we can provide.", "Tyler Brown", "Okay. Perfect. That\u2019s very helpful.", "David Steiner", "In models.", "Tyler Brown", "Okay. Very helpful. Thank you. And then, can you just -- can you guys kind of work through or kind of remind us just what percent of the book is linked to CPI? I am just curious how the 0% all-in prints today are going to impact the '16 pricing? I mean, is that more of a back-half issue? And I mean, should we expect the core pricing will take a step down in ', just mathematically from CPI?", "Jim Fish", "Well, to answer first question, Tyler, it\u2019s about 40% of our businesses is driven by CPI. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a back half issue because I think it's pretty evenly spread. It\u2019s kind of a midyear and then end of the year adjustment, so it's pretty evenly spread for us. And what we've always said about CPI is to the extent that it hurts us will make it up elsewhere with open market.", "David Steiner", "And when we talk about CPI, CPI is not -- there is not one CPI, there is a lot of different CPIs in different contracts. What we've been trying to move toward is more of a industry-specific CPI, what we call the refuse rate index. So that as our costs go up -- when CPI is 1% and you\u2019re given people 3% pay raises, CPI just doesn\u2019t cover your costs. And so, what we've been trying to do in our contracts is look at different types of indexes that more reflect the true cost in our business and try to get those true costs.", "And so I think as an industry, we could probably do a better job of making sure that we don't get linked to some arbitrary type of CPI that we get linked to something specific to our industry. And so when we talk about 40% of our business, a lot of that business or some of that business is tied to what we call this refuse rate index and we hope to move that percentage up.", "Jim Fish", "David, we've had some success in doing that in the first half of this year in some renewals where we moved to more of a refuse index rather than just CPI, so there is some positive trends occurring.", "Tyler Brown", "So, I mean, is it a big portion of that 40%, or is it just kind of a small slice?", "David Steiner", "Yes. It is probably in the 10%, 15% of that 40% and that maybe it's 20%. I don\u2019t have the numbers in front of me Tyler, in that range.", "Jim Fish", "And typically Tyler, where we\u2019ve seen more success in this is in the franchise markets in California. And we\u2019ve had a couple of big franchise agreements that we moved to refuse rate indexes.", "Tyler Brown", "Okay. Great.", "David Steiner", "Tyler, I was talking about at lower end what we\u2019ve done in the first half. Oakland contract is an example of when we did last year that\u2019s going into effect this year that\u2019s on that same basis.", "Tyler Brown", "Okay. Great. And then just lastly real quick, you guys mentioned that I think overall landfill was up 3.2% and MSW landfill was up 7.2%. I think I heard that correct. I am curious, is that a third-party number?", "David Steiner", "Yes.", "Tyler Brown", "Okay. Any color on why landfill MSW has been so strong?", "David Steiner", "It\u2019s been strong now for two and a half years. And it\u2019s probably, mostly tied to when we bought the Oakleaf business and we retained that broker model and we went out to the folks that brokered the collection business for us and said look, we want you to keep that collection business, you\u2019re making good money on it, we want you to keep it. But in return, we want you to bring those volumes door and landfill.", "And that was very successful and that's when we saw the rates go up. And then look, over the last couple of years, I think we've also seen as an industry we\u2019ve seen MSW growth. So, I think the specific actions that we took with respect to our brokers and then the general economy have both been good drivers of MSW.", "Jim Fish", "The encouraging part about not only the volume piece there but really the price piece, if you look at unit rates and our landfills, I was looking at last five years, I mean we\u2019ve really increased unit rates at our landfills by way stream, whether it\u2019s MSW or C&D or special waste.", "So I was kind of thinking along the same line as you. Does this volume mean that we\u2019re seeing a deterioration in price as I think about it by in unit rates? And it\u2019s not. I mean, since 2011, nice increases and it\u2019s every year nice increases for MSW, special waste, C&D.", "Tyler Brown", "Okay. Yes. Very good color because that's what I was going to ask. It sounds like -- is the landfill pricing a key initiative as you look forward?", "David Steiner", "Absolutely, absolutely.", "Tyler Brown", "Okay. All right. Thank you.", "David Steiner", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman of Stifel.", "Michael Hoffman", "Hi, David, Jim and Jim. Thanks for taking my questions. A little bit on the volume. If you look at commercial same-store, kept the customer, have the customer, that volume is up, isn't it, in the container?", "David Steiner", "Yeah. That is correct.", "Michael Hoffman", "Yeah. Right. So\u2026", "David Steiner", "So\u2026", "Michael Hoffman", "\u2026 when you have a 72 from third-party, there is some number that\u2019s got to be in that direction in your commercial market same-store?", "David Steiner", "Yeah. That\u2019s correct.", "Michael Hoffman", "Right. Right. So you are benefiting from what the industry is benefiting is, we\u2019ve had -- you and I interfacing with the economy outside of work, outside of home is driving more volume in the container?", "David Steiner", "Yeah.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay.", "David Steiner", "And again look, we don\u2019t want to declare that good times are here. But you all have heard me say over the last couple of years that that we have fits and starts in the various statistics. And we still haven't seen a very clear-cut trend until last quarter and that trend continued into this quarter. So, when you look at -- this really is the first quarter where all of the indicators are positive.", "And again, that doesn\u2019t mean, we\u2019re going to go from negative 2 to positive 5, but we don't have to, right, in order to drive to make our numbers in the back half of the year. We just want to see continuous improvement. So wage are up, service increases over decreases are up, the churn rates down. On the industrial side, we\u2019ve had really strong new business pricing.", "So this is really the first quarter where I would say, all the indicators are positive. Now look, we all know that can change on a dime. But right now I'm more optimistic about volumes than I've been over the last five years.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay.", "Jim Fish", "Michael, I want to really reemphasize something here that and that is that, because this industry, you\u2019ve been around a long time. The industry has a history of either being one or the other, you\u2019re either priced or your volume and there's nothing in the middle. And so while we\u2019re seeing some nice momentum here on the price side and David went through in the detail a few minutes ago. We are not conceding our strong approach on pricing.", "I mean and that's why we wanted to make sure we gave that explanation of yield versus core price that Jim and I walk through, because we are as strong as we have ever been on pricing. We\u2019re just starting to see, maybe see economy, but I was starting to see that that are volumes are looking promising. It\u2019s early in the third quarter but July looks promising as well.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. So, you have set, let me -- set me up for a perfect follow-on, Jim. I think of waste is having sort of put their foot down on the accelerator on price right to the floorboard for the last four or five years? And you took a volume consequence for that, knowingly. Where are you or are you even contemplating feathering that, where instead of being 100 miles an hour, you are going 80, but now you're not pushing away what could be deemed good business in particularly commercial that -- now that this volume trends coming too?", "David Steiner", "Yeah. Look, just the simple math, you all have heard us say it a million times that you need to get 3% volume in order make up the 1% price, I mean that just simple math. And you can't get 3% volume by giving away 1% price.", "So the waiting of where you want to focus will always be on price. What we want to do and by the way, if we as the largest player in the industry switch and go after volume, what you think the industry is going to do. I mean, look, we\u2019re the largest player and we recognize the position that we\u2019re in.", "So, what we want to do is make sure that we get our fair share of the growth and that we grow the right volumes in the right places. And so, I don't think when you talk to industry participants, I don\u2019t think you'll ever hear anyone say, well, Waste Management is doing a volume graph in market X or market Y.", "Do we have individual contracts that we've done where we've gone after volume, but I wasn't particularly happy with it on our national account side or somewhere like that, yeah, we\u2019ve done that in the past. But it is that certainly not a pattern that you will see out of Waste Management.", "And so, we're always going to favor price over volume, but in a growing market, we are to get our fair share of the volume too, because we can get our fair share of the volume and that won't have an effect on the overall industry pricing dynamic. And so, look, it's pretty simple economics in a better economy. We think we can get both price and volume.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay.", "Jim Fish", "Michael, I add to that that we\u2019ve also because of our price leadership strategy have begun efforts to improve our service. We realize that there are some improvements that\u2019s need to be made to make sure we're providing that service that\u2019s worthy of our priced leadership position. We're doing a better job of that. You see it in the churn rate, we see it in metrics. We're not done with it but we have progressed in that regard.", "Jim Trevathan", "Jim, I was just kind of say that. Michael, when you talk about going from 100 miles an hour to 80 miles an hour on pricing. Look, we\u2019ve had a lot of discussion recently at to Jim's point about differentiated strategy. I mean, you can still go 100 miles an hour on pricing if you're differentiated.", "I mean, if your strategy is differentiation with things like the industrial business where we provide expertise and that others don't have and size of our balance sheet, things like that or whether it's bringing technology to bear or to Jim's point, improving customer service, all of those enable you to keep your foot on the pricing accelerator.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. So but to Jim T's comment, then the churn rate must be coming down if the service relationship is getting better?", "Jim Trevathan", "It was -- it\u2019s not where we wanted to be but 10.3 is a whole lot better than 12.2 than it was -- that Q2 of \u201814. So absolutely, we see improvement and we expect more.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. And then \u2026.", "David Steiner", "And Michael just to expand on that so should be loss if we improve the churn rate at 190 basis point but we didn't materially increase the rollbacks, right, I mean, in the past what we\u2019ve seen is that we have the one of the ways we improve the churn rate is our rollback percentage grows from 25% to 60%. This quarter we reduce the churn rate by 190 basis points with virtually nonexistent change in our rollback percentage.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. So we have known each other too long because you just anticipated my next question. So that was you\u2019re retaining more price too then, is that\u2026", "David Steiner", "You got that.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. All right. So, now I am changing gears a second. Some housekeeping questions, Jim Fish. Starting share count for 3Q should be about $454 million or $454 million, is that the right way to think about it?", "Jim Fish", "I think more like $457 million, I think is the number.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. What's the $451.8 million then that it\u2019s in the press release, plus the comp numbers like $2.8 million? I can follow-up on that, but I just want to make sure I have the starting place. And then on tax rate, just following up on the question that was asked earlier, that's 3Q and 4Q should have a 35%, not that the full year will be 35%?", "David Steiner", "Correct.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. And working capital, you didn't talk about that. Where are we on DSOs and payables for your plan there?", "David Steiner", "I\u2019m sorry, as of DPOs?", "Michael Hoffman", "Yes.", "David Steiner", "DSO, DPO. Yeah. We\u2019ve made some nice progress there over the last two and a half years. We made nice progress sequentially. Year-over-year and sequentially from Q1, we've improved DPO by about a little bit less than three days, DSO by over less than one day. When I looked at it, over kind of the time period that we've really started working on this over maybe two and a half year period, we\u2019ve really improved the combination of the two by nine days. It's not totally out of the realm of hospitality that we couldn\u2019t crossover at some point down the road. We are still away from that. Some of our areas have started to crossover where the DPO is higher than their DSO. But, yeah, I'm pleased with the progress but won\u2019t be completely pleased until we crossover like most companies are.", "Michael Hoffman", "All right. So just to put numbers on that, you are still in the mid-40s on DSOs and high 20s on DPOs, days?", "David Steiner ", "We are in the low 40s on DSO and we\u2019ve crossed over to 30 now. We are about 30 on the DPO.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. Okay. And then I didn't -- you said this, but I was writing so many numbers, I missed it. What was the special waste trend at the landfill in the second quarter?", "David Steiner", "Yeah, the special waste was 2.4% as I recall. Let me just look, yeah, the volume was 2.4% for special waste. And when we look at it, we sort of look at special waste C&D and revenue generating cover. When you look at special waste, it was 2.4% of revenue-generating cover, which is essentially, special waste was about 10%.", "Michael Hoffman", "Well. And I guess where I was going, it was wet in a lot of places in the country and special waste is predominantly dirt, so there is a good chance that we could see a special waste number that\u2019s much bigger in 3Q because you just couldn't get heavy equipment in to move the dirt around?", "David Steiner", "Yeah. We actually have that discussion with our folks out in the markets. And we obviously have some left down here in the Texas area. You had it up in the upper Midwest. I think what our folks would say is the pipeline looks pretty strong. We don't expect special waste to slowdown in the back half of the year. So, I think they are pretty optimistic about it.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. And then on the deal commentary, just to be clear, I get the ones you have got targeted are solid waste, but that doesn't preclude you. You made a comment earlier, David, that I just want to make sure I understand. You would buy a hazardous waste business or an energy waste business under the right circumstances. That's just not what you are targeting at the moment.", "David Steiner", "Yes, no. Absolutely, we would. And we consider those, sort of core solid waste types businesses. Those are areas where we can apply our expertise very easily. What we aren\u2019t going to do is what I led five years ago, which is get into some other types of businesses that where we can take our solid waste expertise and apply them very easily.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. Saving the best for last, Jim Fish, on free cash flow. If I take your $1.5 billion and I look at it on what's the recurring operating cash generation, I got to pull out $300 million, right? $100 million for asset sales, round numbers, $200 million for cash tax, so I start at $1.2 billion, and then you are suggesting you will be $1.35 billion potentially. You're not giving guidance. But none of that has any deals in it, so that's a pretty healthy $150 million swing. How much of that is working capital versus the optimization programs, cost saves, organic?", "Jim Fish", "Part of it, Michael is, you pull out $100 million in acquisitions, I mean in dispositions. But we do dispositions every year. We sort of always assume that we\u2019re going to call it $50 million to $100 million of asset dispositions. And so that\u2019s -- I'm not sure that you can pull out that $400 million.", "David Steiner", "And help me again. How did you get to the $1.2 billion, I know you pulled out the cash tax. What else did you pull?", "Michael Hoffman", "Well. You have asset sales, so I can't predict that number, right, because I can drive a truck between $50 million and $100 million. So if I say, all right, what is the business generating in its own cash -- $1.5 billion less $100 million for asset sales, $200 million for cash taxes puts it at $1.2 billion? $1.2 billion goes to $1.35 billion, that's $150 million year-over-year improvement and there is no deals in that. I'm just trying to understand.", "Jim Fish", "I\u2019m trying to also kind of normalize CapEx. I don\u2019t know what my CapEx is going to be next year but 2014 CapEx was 11.50. 2015 CapEx is going to be 1.3. So by the way on a smaller business at this point, I mean. We don't have Wheelabrator. We don\u2019t have Puerto Rico. We don\u2019t have Maritimes. So I'm adding back a bit there in CapEx too. But it\u2019s hard to say when our -- we know we are going to have some CapEx next year for Oakland. We had some this year for Oakland. So it\u2019s not going to $11.50 again but it may not be $13 either.", "David Steiner ", "Hey Michael, you and Jim were talking the same number, the only differences is the divestiture piece, basically.", "Jim Fish", "And I think that\u2019s the whole point Michael is that the divestitures and the CapEx that can move around a little bit. So when you look at the sort of a long-term history of what we\u2019ve done both on CapEx and on divestitures, you sort of get to that 1.35 number.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay, yes. What I was really trying to understand was what made up the $150 million, and so some of it is CapEx. How much, then, is organic versus the optimization programs you have initiated over the last couple years? How would you\u2026", "Jim Fish", "We\u2019ll get into that. I don\u2019t want to try to parse it to the penny because, frankly, we haven't done that. We\u2019ll certainly do that next year when we give 2016 guidance. So that\u2019s that's probably a better time to try to parse it down to the penny.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay.", "David Steiner ", "We still did get asked the starting point though so we did have variance.", "Michael Hoffman", "Right, so we are both agreeing on one, two, so that -- good enough. All right, thanks.", "David Steiner", "Certainly.", "Jim Fish", "And Michael, your question about share counts, I mean the difference between your 451 or 452 and my 457 is just the effect of using weighted average common shares outstanding and that has to do with midyear share repurchase.", "Michael Hoffman", "Got it. Okay. All right, perfect. Thanks.", "David Steiner", "Thanks, Michael.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Barbara Noverini of Morningstar.", "Barbara Noverini", "Hi. Good morning, everybody.", "David Steiner", "Good morning.", "Barbara Noverini", "You talked a little bit about differentiation earlier in order to push price. And I thought we would focus on the residential business just a little bit. My sense is that Waste Management used to differentiate itself with recycling services in a bundled contract. But now that you are heavily scrutinizing recycling, how else do you differentiate in residential outside of recycling? Is winning or renewing municipal contracts in this competitive environment increasingly dependent on the bundled services you are able to provide municipalities?", "David Steiner", "Yeah. So I don't think the bundling of recycling with residential slows down. In fact, frankly, it\u2019s more of an opportunity to bundle it, because given the asset mix that we have, we\u2019re one of the few companies that actually make money on recycling. So probably give us a little bit of a competitive advantage as far as bundling recycling with that -- with residential services. But when we look at the residential line of business, we start out with let's keep the contracts that we have at current rates or higher rate. And keeping the contract that you have is all about service, right.", "Most municipalities, if they had your service for a long time and they\u2019re happy with it but citizens aren\u2019t looking for a change just to save a little bit of money. And so the first part of our residential strategies keep the contracts that we have at the same or higher rates. And we\u2019ve got a very high success rate of doing that. And then the second piece is finds out where we can be competitive -- competitively advantaged. So if it is in a market where we have recycling capability, no one else does, can we bundle it with recycling capability?", "If it\u2019s in our market where we have the different types of disposal assets and different green initiatives that we can bring to the table and that\u2019s what the customer wants. That\u2019s how we differentiate ourselves. And so for us it is a two part strategy. It\u2019s make sure you keep your current contract and that\u2019s by providing spectacular service. And then let\u2019s find out where we can win bids that aren\u2019t based solely on price because if they are based solely on price, we aren\u2019t going to win. And so let's find those markets where service recycling, green initiatives make a difference and let\u2019s go in and win those bid.", "Barbara Noverini", "Thanks for that.", "Jim Fish", "I mean, we almost look at it by line of business, because what differentiates you in the industrial line of business is different than what differentiates you in the residential line of business. So as we've -- in fact we\u2019re aware of the process of going through a strategy preparation to present to the board here in August and we\u2019re focusing specifically on differentiation in any one case.", "And it is by line of business. So maybe we bring different technology to the table, maybe -- certainly operating efficiency because so much of the residential business is driven by price. And then you got to be as efficient from operating standpoint as you can in residential.", "Barbara Noverini", "Great. Got it. Thanks for that.", "David Steiner ", "Absolutely.", "Operator", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. David Steiner for closing remarks.", "David Steiner", "Thank you. Thank you all for joining us. We\u2019ve had a strong start to the year. We expect to finish the year strong. And we\u2019ll see you next quarter. Thanks again.", "Operator", "Thank you for participating in today's Waste Management's conference call.

Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. Our strong third quarter results continued what we saw through the first six months of the year: disciplined pricing and cost control programs driving improvement in our business. In the third quarter, we earned $0.74 per share, an increase of more than 10% than the third quarter of 2014. Each of our net income, operating income and margin, operating EBITDA and margin, and earnings per diluted share improved when compared to the third quarter of 2014.", "Through the first nine months of the year, our operations have generated almost $2 billion in cash provided from operating activities, which is a 16.5% increase from the prior year when you exclude divested businesses. Our strong performance puts us on track to exceed our full-year goals, and we're excited about the positive momentum building into the fourth quarter and heading into 2016.", "Again in the third quarter, our pricing programs continued to be a big part of our earnings growth and margin expansion. For the third quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4%, which is consistent with the third quarter of 2014, and yield was 1.8%. Core price in the industrial line was 8.4%; in the commercial line, it was 5.7%; in our residential line, it was 2.2%; and in our landfill line, it was 2.3%. Year-to-date through September, core price was 4.2%, which exceeds our 2015 core price target of 3.8%. As we saw in the first half of the year, core price continues to drive margin expansion, as our traditional solid waste business operating EBITDA and operating EBITDA margin increased when compared to the third quarter of 2014.", "Turning to volumes, when we look at our business, we track traditional solid waste volumes, which exclude recycling and non-solid waste revenues. Our traditional solid waste volumes were basically flat, declining only 0.1% in the third quarter of 2015 versus the decline of 1.9% in the third quarter of 2014, a 180 basis point year-over-year improvement and a 50 basis point sequential improvement from the 0.6% decline in the second quarter of 2015. Overall volume, which includes recycling and those non-solid waste volumes, declined 1.4% in the third quarter.", "In our industrial line of business, the positive momentum that we saw in the second quarter continued into the third quarter. Strong new business pricing outpaced the price of lost business. So we were able to get both a strong price and positive volumes in the quarter, as industrial volume was a positive 0.4% in the third quarter of 2015, improving 290 basis points from negative 2.5% in the third quarter of 2014.", "We also saw the rate of decline in our commercial line of business improve again, as the rate of loss in commercial volumes improved 360 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2014, and 90 basis points sequentially, from a negative 4.9% in the third quarter of 2014 to a negative 1.3% in the third quarter of 2015. This is the best commercial volume that we've seen since 2006.", "Our service increases continued to exceed decreases, and new business in our commercial and industrial lines combined exceeded lost business for the second consecutive quarter. These are all positive signs that make us optimistic that volume should continue to strengthen into 2016.", "Turning to recycling, we continue to work together with our customers, vendors, and industry groups to improve the long-term outlook for recycling through educating the public on what and how to recycle to bring down contamination levels. We have also made progress on renegotiating contractual terms with our customers, including exiting some unprofitable contracts. Ultimately, we want to provide recycling solutions that both meet our customers' needs and generate an appropriate return for us. Recycling is the right option for the environment, and we are working to make it the right business decision for our shareholders as well.", "Moving to current results from our recycling operations in the third quarter, earnings per share from the recycling operations were flat compared to the third quarter of 2014 despite a 15% drop in average commodity prices, and a 6.4% decline in volumes, which is largely associated with contractual losses as we shed unprofitable business.", "Our recycling employees performed incredibly in reducing operating costs and improving the business. In the third quarter, we saw a 7% improvement in operating cost per ton compared to 2014. So we're moving in the right direction, and our results in 2015 will exceed the expectations we laid out earlier in the year. But there is still a long way to go to get the appropriate returns on our existing assets.", "With respect to potential acquisitions, as we mentioned on our second quarter conference call, we believe that we can execute agreements to add an additional $50 million to $75 million of operating EBITDA in 2016. Recently, we closed on two acquisitions that we expect to generate approximately $18 million in operating EBITDA in 2016. Our pipeline still looks strong, and we're in the advanced stages of some transactions. Consequently, we still believe that we can close transactions that will generate $50 million to $70 million of additional 2016 operating EBITDA.", "So we expect to see strong operating EBITDA growth from our core business and from acquisitions in 2016. But I will remind you that the operating EBITDA from acquisitions won't translate to earnings per share in 2016, because we'll have corresponding intangible amortization. However, the transactions will generate cash flow, which is the most important metric in our business, and we expect that our cash flow in 2016 will be strong.", "In conclusion, we've seen three consecutive quarters of strong results, and we're confident that strength will continue as we conclude the year and look forward to 2016. This performance is a tribute to our employees executing our pricing, disciplined growth, and cost control strategies.", "We're confident that our employees' focus on our core business will allow us to meet the analysts' fourth quarter consensus of $0.67 of adjusted earnings per diluted share, which would allow us to exceed the upper end of our 2015 adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance of $2.55.", "We also expect to exceed the upper end of our full-year free cash flow guidance of $1.5 billion, in which case, we may decide to prepay some items to help offset tax and other cash-flow headwinds in 2016.", "I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our third quarter results in more detail.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, David. In the third quarter of 2015, SG&A costs continue to a bright spot in our results even as we face tougher comparisons to the prior year. Overall, SG&A costs improved $8 million compared to the third quarter of 2014. As a percent of revenue, SG&A costs were 9.8%, an improvement of 10 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2014. With the strong results from the first nine months of 2015, we expect to achieve our full-year goal of reducing SG&A costs by $60 million.", "Turning to cash flow for the third quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities was $657 million, compared to $627 million in the third quarter of 2014, after adjusting for $45 million from the divested operations. Other impacts on our cash provided by operating activities were $40 million paid to complete our withdrawal from the Central States Pension Plan and a $60 million reduction in cash taxes paid.", "During the third quarter we continued to improve our working capital position, as we reduced days sales outstanding by 1.4 days and increased days payables outstanding by 3.9 days. We are pleased with these results as our team has done a terrific job of making these improvements, and we expect to see continued improvement into 2016.", "Free cash flow was $358 million in the third quarter of 2015, an increase of $20 million when excluding free cash flow from divested operations in 2014. Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $335 million, $28 million more than the third quarter of 2014.", "As David mentioned, we've generated almost $2 billion of cash provided by operating activities through the first nine months of 2015. In addition, we've generated over $1.2 billion of free cash flow. Given that, we expect the free cash flow in 2015 will exceed the upper end of our guidance range of $1.5 billion. David mentioned that we would pre-pay some expenses in the event that we exceed our free cash flow guidance. An example might be prepaying cash taxes. We currently anticipate that our 2016 cash taxes will increase by $300 million to $400 million. If we have excess free cash flow, we may elect to prepay some of the cash tax increase at year-end to lessen the impact of this increase.", "Third quarter revenues were $3.36 billion. We saw a $53 million increase in revenues from acquisitions and a $48 million increase in our traditional solid waste business. We also saw an overall revenue decline of $186 million from divestures, a $49 million decline from lower recycling revenues, $47 million in lower fuel surcharge revenues, and $41 million in foreign currency fluctuations.", "Looking at internal revenue growth in the third quarter. Our collection and disposal core price was 4%, with total volumes declining 1.4%. This led to total company income from operations growing $24 million, operating income margin expanding 110 basis points, operating EBITDA growing $29 million, and operating EBITDA margin growing 140 basis points, in each case compared to third quarter 2014 results. Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefit of core price and disciplined growth as operating EBITDA and operating EBITDA margins grew.", "In the landfill line of business, we saw the benefits of both positive volume and positive core price in the third quarter. We saw same-store average MSW rates increase year-over-year for the 10th consecutive quarter, up 3.6% from Q3 2014. MSW volumes grew 5.9%, C&D volume grew 4.9%, and special waste volumes were a positive 2.4%. Total landfill volumes increased 4%. Our special waste pipeline looks strong and we expect to see landfill volumes remain strong through 2016.", "Moving to operating expenses. As a percent of revenue, operating costs improved 140 basis points to 62.4%. Lower diesel costs and lower recycling commodity rebates to our customers contributed $73 million to the improvements. We also had reduced expenses from foreign currency fluctuations. Subcontractor costs improved $17 million, and labor and related benefits improved $12 million when compared to the third quarter of 2014, as we continue to see improvement from our service delivery optimization program. These savings were partially offset by increased disposal cost related to our improved volumes and slightly higher maintenance cost. Overall, operating cost improved $91 million in the third quarter.", "Finally, looking at our other financial metrics. At the end of the third quarter, our debt-to-total-capital ratio was 63.3% and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.4%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 8% at the end of the quarter. In the third quarter, we repurchased 5.9 million of our outstanding shares for $300 million and paid $172 million of dividends. This $472 million reflects our confidence in the cash generation of our business, and our commitment to return cash to our shareholders. Our income tax rate in the third quarter was 32.3%, which compares to 30.6% for the third quarter of 2014.", "In tribute to the late and great Hall of Famer Yogi Berra, our third quarter results were d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again. We've seen three consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvements and we expect that to continue into the fourth quarter.", "All of our employees have worked hard to deliver these solid results, and for that I want to thank them. We are very confident that they will continue to deliver strong earnings and cash flow to complete a successful 2015 and set us up for continued improvement throughout 2016.", "And with that, Janisha, let's open the line up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of Scott Levine of Imperial Capital.", "Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "Yeah. Good morning, guys.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Scott.", "Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "So, just looking for maybe a little bit of an update on the pricing environment. Core pricing looked like it was pretty strong in the quarter, but it sounds like a lot of the gross margin expansion you're getting is from lower fuel and commodity costs, but are you still seeing a pretty good pricing environment out there? How are you progressing with regard to your price case, you still getting good margin expansion associated with your internal pricing activities?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I'd say, sort of as a follow-on to last quarter, I would say that the overall pricing environment is as solid as I've seen it since I've been at Waste Management. We see real good progress across all lines of business except for our residential line. And as you all know, the residential line is traditionally the most competitive line. I would say even in the residential line, though, we're seeing very disciplined pricing based on return on invested capital type of metrics from the large national players.", "It's always sort of those small local and regional players that seem to sometimes forget that that if you offer a lower price and you invest a lot of capital in those residential contracts, that over the term of those contracts, you don't make as much money as you'd think. But even in the residential line, what we're seeing is sort of those large national companies are bidding based on return on capital, not on chasing low-priced volume. So, I'd say overall I'm extremely encouraged by the pricing environment. We expect it to hold into 2016.", "Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "Got it. And maybe shifting to tax for a bit here. So, I don't know if Jim had given a tax rate assumption for the fourth quarter, did you give one?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I did, and our tax rate in the fourth quarter is going to be similar to the third quarter.", "Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "Okay. So that was just about 32%, and then with 2016 you mentioned $300 million to $400 million pick-up in cash tax, but for some of this pre-payment \u2013 maybe a little bit more elaboration there, and if we do get renewal of bonus depreciation, might you see a significant benefit associated with that, and one that you may be able to take an early shot at quantifying?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. If we do get bonus depreciation and thanks to our slow moving congress, it seems like that always happens at the very end of the year, but it's probably going to be in the neighborhood of $70 million, Scott, for bonus depreciation. And then when you think about that $300 million to $400 million, really that's \u2013 of course that's the prepayment from last year of 2014, it's the $150 million or so from the early extinguishment of debts, transaction earlier in the year.", "And then combining all those benefits with earnings growth in 2016, our cash tax headwind will be somewhere in that $300 million to $400 million, which is why David and I both mentioned the fact that we probably will prepay, certainly the \u2013 probably half of that's benefit from the early extinguishment of debt will get push forward in the 2016, and then depending on how we do with respect to free cash flow, it's possible that we will prepay additional taxes at the end of the quarter.", "Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "Got it. So said in other way, maybe, expect maybe at least half of that increase in 2016 to be pulled into 4Q, based on what you expect right now?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I think that sounds about right.", "Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "Got it. One last one on the M&A side, so you're essentially I guess affirming the EBITDA, the target that you expected to acquire for next year. Should we assume those are kind of your traditional solid waste acquisitions, or has your view changed at all with regard to, call it the non-traditional waste business, whether it's industrial, energy or otherwise?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. No, that would be a core solid waste. We would consider hazardous waste and energy services both to be core businesses. And if we found some transactions in those areas, we'd look at them. Obviously we would look at them based on today's environment, not on tomorrow's environment or yesterday's environment. But when we talk about that $50 million to $70 million of additional, on top of the $18 million that we've already closed, we would \u2013 yeah, we'd look at those more as traditional solid \u2013 what you'd look at as traditional solid waste businesses.", "Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "Got it. Thanks. Nice quarter.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure. Thanks.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Corey Greendale of First Analysis.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Hey, good morning.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning, Corey.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "First, I wanted to follow-on Scott's question about price. It sounds like the environment is favorable overall. But I guess, first of all, can you just verify, I had from my notes that about 40% of your revenue base is tied directly to CPI, do I have that right?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That's about right, yeah.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "So could you just address that portion specifically, given where CPI is at? Should we expect lower price in those markets in 2016, and what does that imply for overall price growth in 2016 relative to 2015?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. When we look at our CPI business, we always look at it and say, look, there is nothing we can do about CPI, because it's a government-posted staff that we cannot control. So, sometimes we're going to get hurt, sometimes we're going to get helped by it. It seems over the last few years, all's we've done is get hurt by it.", "So in 2016, we don't expect to have a benefit from CPI, in fact we'd expect to have a little bit of a detriment to pricing from CPI in 2016. But like we've always said, we can't control that. What we can control is the core price on the rest of our business. And so if we aren't going to \u2013 my guess is that we will have sort of a consistent core price target next year, that we've had both in 2014 and 2015, and if we're not going to get it from CPI, we'll make up for it by getting core price on our other lines of business.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Got it. And just to clarify, when you say you can't control CPI, obviously that's true, but one of your large competitors has talked about trying to shift customers to more of a sewer water waste index instead of CPI. Is that something you've thought about or are doing at all?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Oh, absolutely. We've actually done that. We've tried to use that index, we've also used what we've called sort of our solid waste index. And so every time that we talk to the customers \u2013 look, this goes back 10 to 12 years ago, when we first instituted a fuel surcharge, because we saw fuel prices fluctuating. What has to happen is that everyone in the industry needs to say, look, this just doesn't make sense for us unless we look at these contracts with this type of adjustment in it.", "And so, going back 10 years ago, when we first put in the fuel surcharge on our residential contracts, everyone said that's never going to happen, because the municipalities won't accept it. And as the industry said, we're just not going to bid unless we have a fuel surcharge, customers started to accept it. It's the same thing with CPI. Look, every single company has been hurt by CPI in the last five years. And I think it's incumbent upon the largest companies to say, look, we're just not going to bid these under the traditional CPI, or even worse, 75%-of-CPI type of contracts. And if the industry is able to do that, then you'll see municipalities change, but they are not going to change when only one player is out there doing it. So we've been doing that, particularly in California for the last number of years, and will continue to do that throughout the country.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "I understand. And, David, can you just talk a little bit about how you are thinking about new business, kind of your selling effort in an improving economic environment? Whether \u2013 what's the state of your sales force, are you growing the sales force, are you changing how they're incentivized or anything like that to try to win new business?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I'm not sure I'd say that we're growing our sales force, I'd say what we're doing is we're sort of reallocating our sales force. From our perspective, what we've tried to do is put our sales force in those areas where it's growing. So when we look at a market area that's not growing, we might reduce the sales force, whereas when we look at market area that is growing, might add to sales force. And so there won't be a drastic addition to our sales force. There will certainly be a reallocation of our efforts in those lines of business that are growing and in those geographies that are growing.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Okay. And then one more from me. It sounds like you're making good progress on reducing your recycling processing costs. Can you just give us a couple of sensitives on what that constitutes, whether it's a labor question or you're putting in different equipment, just what you're doing there? And then secondly, the reduction that you've seen so far, how far does that take you towards your goal? I think the goal is reducing average cost per ton by $10 or something like that?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I would say we're probably 70%, two-thirds, 70% of the way there on our goals. There's still plenty of room for improvement. And those cost improvements have come from sort of all of the above. First and foremost, you have the operational improvements. But secondly, you have shutting down some of our more high-cost operations. And so, we've basically shut down those operations that we would expect to shut down. There are some contracts that we need to get out of that are high-processing contracts.", "And then finally, we need to reduce those contamination levels. That's \u2013 frankly, that's what drove the highest increase in our operating costs. And so, working with our customers, we need to make sure that when we have a contamination rate goal in each \u2013 in our contracts, which we have in virtually all of our contracts, we need to make sure that our customers are meeting those goals. And so, we'll go in and do the audits to make sure that that we're dropping those contamination rates. And so, look, our recycling folks have really done a spectacular job of approaching the operating costs from every angle. I think there's still some room for improvement in 2016, but they've done a heck of a job so far.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "There's still a day where some of those contracts will fall off during 2016.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Right.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "That will provide some structural improvement as well for the recycling business.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Corey, I think that's a \u2013 this is the first time that we have talked about, internally at least, 2016 not being a big down year versus the prior year in recycling. By the way, it's not because of any help we're getting on the commodity line, it's just that the efforts of our team to really permanently change the way the business operates on the cost side are starting to really bear some fruit.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Okay, great. Thanks very much.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Absolutely.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Box of KeyBanc Capital Market.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, guys.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Good morning, Joe.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "So, I just wanted to dig into the moderating decline in solid waste volumes. How would you explain the 180 basis point of improvement year-over-year? Is that more a function of waste fundamentals improving? Is it better sales execution? Or is it may be just a function of your pricing is up, but it's not up quite as much? Just any color on that would be helpful.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I would say that primarily, it's related to improving fundamentals of the industry. We really aren't using price to go out and chase volumes. So you've got improving fundamentals across some lines, like the industrial line, where \u2013 frankly in the industrial line, we probably could have grown it more in the last couple of quarters, but we're constrained by the number of containers and drivers and trucks that we have on the road.", "And so primarily, it's improving industry fundamentals, but we really have seen a nice improvement in productivity from our sales force. When I talked about it earlier, we're not adding a lot of folks to our sales force, but we are top-grading our sales force, and the folks we have right now are much more productive than they've been in the past. And so it's really sales productivity, and mostly improving business fundamentals.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Joe, we've talked a lot about also the fact that on the disposal side, how important pricing is there. And when we see same-store average MSW rates up approaching 4%, and kind of we've just talked about CPI being close to zero, in almost a zero-inflation economy, we're pretty happy with that. And at the same time, we see almost 6% growth in MSW volumes. To us, that's really where we've got to dig in, is on the disposal side of our business.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Joe, I was going to add also that you mentioned \u2013 you opened with price comment. And we've maintained that approximate 4% core price number while improving volumes. We also had rollbacks for the quarter at about 18%, so that's a real improvement versus prior year. So, all of those factors have helped improve volume, and we've maintained a price focus.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And to Jim's point, on the industrial line, our new business pricing is actually higher than our average rates. And so, we're seeing real strong pricing on the industrial side. Look, industrial volumes are as close to a spot market as we have, as we've talked about many times, and the spot market right now is very strong. And so, you should be getting both positive price and positive volume. Obviously that will moderate as we come into the seasonality and the weather of the fourth quarter and the first quarter. But I would expect to see that improve, both volume and price improve, as we come out of the winter and get into the seasonal uptick next year.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "That's great color. And let me actually just follow up on that. You guys have made it clear that you do want to manage to a certain price increase. And I guess the specific metric that you're looking at is core price. Jim, you mentioned better rollbacks, and I think, David, you said something about the industrial business not necessarily coming in at a lower price. So I understand there are some nuances here. But how are you incentivizing the sales force to really minimize the impact of rollbacks and lower new business coming online, with the exception of industrial?", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Joe, our sales incentive plan for the account mangers that manage our current business is directly linked to how much price they get for their current customers, and whether or not there are rollbacks. So it is a direct impact on that sales rep when they increase rollbacks or they don't get their price. So it's a direct link, and that has...", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. So it's not just core price...", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "No...", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "It's also looking at rollbacks and where they're bringing on new business?", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Absolutely. New business pricing...", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Perfect.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "...the payout as well.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And Joe, look, when it comes to sales inventive plans, I think everyone that's ever managed a sale force would love to have EBIT as the core metric rather than revenue growth, right? Because you can get revenue growth at low margins, and that doesn't do anyone very much good. We've got a tool that we're rolling out in 2015, it will be fully rolled out in 2016, that will allow us to measure profitability at the customer level.", "At that point in time, I would expect us to relook at the compensation plans and say, okay, rather than focusing on revenue and price, let's start now focusing on the actual EBIT that we're generating, and start incentivizing folks to generate higher EBIT. How do you that? By selling the right volume, by selling the right volume at the right price. And so we've got compensation plans in place right now that I think drive the right behavior; that's only going to get better through 2016 and into 2017.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "In the meantime, Joe, we have absolute control over the pricing, the area level and the corporate for the larger accounts. So we know exactly where our reps are going in from a price standpoint on an overall basis. So, we're not waiting for that tool to help us in that regard.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Got it. Thanks for the all the detail.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman of Stifel.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thank you all for taking my questions. If I could follow back up a little bit around the solid waste and the commentary on volumes, just to slice it once a little bit differently. If you looked at the same store volume trends on front-end loader business, residential and your permanent rolloff, because I get that temporary has been very strong \u2013 on the permanent. What's the trend on the same-store basis for each of those lines in collection?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "As far as waste go?", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yes. The volume. Just what's the direction? Is it positive, flat, negative?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I mean, obviously it fluctuates slightly quarter-to-quarter, but I would tell you the trend line is that both of them were slightly \u2013 actually slightly negative this quarter. But the prior two quarters, they were up. And so, I would tell you the trend line is up. So we \u2013 and service increases have exceeded service decreases. So I would tell you that that every trends outline that we look at \u2013 and as you know, Michael, I haven't been saying this for the last three years \u2013 but every trend line we look at right now is positive.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. So just so I make sure I understood that, the overall trend in permanent roll-off, front-end loader and residential, since \u2013 weight \u2013 since every day this stuff goes across the scale \u2013 is positive, which indicates this improving volume pattern structurally?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I would say that's true for commercial and industrial. Residential, we, frankly, we don't look at that. We look at that a little bit differently than we look at the other lines of business. So we're not as focused on waste on the residential side.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Fair enough, because it's really about the asset utilization of the equipment going down the route. How do you \u2013 how would you frame your churn trend at this juncture as well, both the direction and then the rate of replacement?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So, the rate of replacement actually has improved fairly dramatically over the last four quarters. And the churn rate, so this quarter, we saw about an 80 basis point improvement in the churn rate, but it's stubbornly stuck, it's sort of that 10% to 10.5% churn. Our focus in 2016 is going to be to try to drive that churn rate down below 10%.", "Now, look, again, this is a simple business, if you want to use price as you lever. We could drive that churn rate well below 10% if we just acceded to every single customer asking for a price rollback. But as Jim pointed out, our price rollback trends are actually very positive, too. And so, again when you look at the combination of trends, you can look at rollbacks and say, boy, rollbacks are going great, but if you're doing it via price, not so great. And what we've done over the last two years is seen the churn rate come down \u2013 marginally, not as much as we like to see it come down. But we've seen the rollback rates also perform very well, while not giving away the price. And so, the combination of the three is very positive.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Fair enough. And if you look \u2013 go ahead, sorry.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "I want to add one other thing quickly to it. And that's the addition rate, I think you had mentioned \u2013 questioned as well. Dave said it's very positive. I mean, we're about 200 basis points positive on the addition rate. And that's really helped some of the \u2013 especially the commercial volume. We're positive in dollars in 15 of the 17 areas. And the other two are fairly close, and making real improvements versus prior year. So, the trends are positive, as Dave stressed.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And on the churn, given it may be stubbornly where it is, how do you think about it as that which you control versus that which you don't, and that which you control isn't so much about price as it's more service-oriented things that you could fix and that you could keep doing what you're doing on price?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I mean, roughly half of it is structural. Companies going out of business or relocating. So that leaves you 500 basis points to 600 basis points of churn that is voluntary. And you've hit the nail right on the head. I mean, every study that we've done since I've been at this company for 15 years tells us that price is not the primary reason for churn. Now, price becomes the primary reason for churn when you have a service failure.", "And so, I always liken it to the cable companies. We all get a flyer every week that offers us lower price for cable. There's probably a lot of people that accept that and say, let's take it every time we can get it. But 90% of the folks say, you know what, the cost of changing out is too high, so I'll accept the fact that this price might be a little bit higher, but I'll accept it because the pain of switching is too high, until the cable starts going out or the satellite dish starts going out. And then all of a sudden, that price offer looks pretty attractive.", "But every study we've ever done says that service failures drive churn, and that's why we've reinstituted what we had when I first came to the company 15 years ago, the service machine program, which, when I came here 15 years ago, did a great job of rallying the company around the customer. And we've tried to do that in the last 14 months, that's exactly what we've been trying to do, rally our company around the customer, and we're seeing some really nice progress in that regard.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And when you think about the efforts in productivity and service optimization, is that what's giving you the comfort to say 10% goes \u2013 we go below 10% in 2016, as you correct that missed pickup, which is usually driven by a truck that broke down, things like that?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. And you hit another great point, which is it's not just wanting to have great service, it's also being able to provide great service by having a truck that's operating, which goes back to maintenance and fleet and all of those types of issues. And so, what we've done, Michael, is try to take a holistic view of what causes a service failure. And you're absolutely right, a lot of times it's because we don't have a truck that can service it. And so when we look at driving it below 10%, we really need to have all of our operations working in conjunction with our sales folks to execute flawlessly.", "And I will tell you, not just at Waste Management but throughout the entire solid waste industry, it is stunning to me that we do our jobs every day as well as we do them. But at Waste Management what we've said is the good is not good enough, we have to be great, and that's what Jim's got the company focused on.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Michael, one thing that we've changed in that regard, you mentioned the missed pickups, you do a missed pickup measurement and we're pretty good. We compete with almost any in the industry around missed pickups that are reported by the customer. We've taken another view of that, we're looking now, as Dave mentioned, the maintenance side, we're looking at service failures where perhaps if a truck went down late in a day, and we missed half a route, and we're going to pick it back up tomorrow.", "Well that's a missed pickup from the customer's view, and we're adding that to the metric and looking at it a little differently than just past when the customer responded to a missed pickup, trying to add and restore that confidence where a truck went down. And fleet's part of it, but the real issues also surround our call centers and how well they are connected to the field, and we can respond to that customer's need in a more timely matter. So it's a huge focus for us, it's been that way in the past, but we're adding a little more color to it.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then Jim Fish, I think I understand what you're saying about free cash, but I just want to say it out loud to make sure I get it. So, I'm picking a number just to frame it, if $1.5 billion is this year's number. And all things being equal that number would be mid-point of the $300 million to $340 million is \u2013 $350 million, so is $1.5 billion is down by $350 million because of more cash tax, and then it grows based on all the other things you would do. And your intention is to pay some of that $350 million this year, so the $1.5 billion would be less \u2013 it's smoothing your cash, which is perfectly appropriate. I just want to make sure I understand it.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. I think that's \u2013 I'm not sure I'd use the word smooth, but that's about right. One thing I would say, Michael, about free cash is that we're pleased with \u2013 here is \u2013 we've been kind of a $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion free cash flow company over the last six years. And I think what you're seeing is in 2015 and going into 2016, for those two years, is we're starting to become more of a $1.4 billion free cash flow company, and that is really a function of all these things we've talked about, but it's largely organic growth for us.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Right. So if you didn't prepay anything, it's not an unreasonable observation that sequentially the cash could be down. That's not a bad sign, it's just the timing of big flows like that. If we didn't have BD in all that, we wouldn't be talk \u2013 having this conversation.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "That's right. Without question, Michael. If we didn't prepay anything because of the big headwind that we've got, we'd be down.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think Jim's point shouldn't be lost, which is we're sort of establishing a new baseline, to say, we're a $1.4 billion baseline free cash flow generating company. Now some years, we might generate $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion; other years \u2013 and to the extent that we can prepay those cash taxes to ensure that next year we hit that baseline of $1.4 billion and we don't have those headwinds, we ought to do that. But going forward I would tell you, Michael, that $1.4 billion is sort of our stepping-off point. Obviously we'll give more specific guidance when we give it in February. But at this point, I think we've gone from saying we're $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion baseline free cash flow company to we're a $1.4 billion base line free cash flow company.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yeah, we agree. So, how do you think about the sustainable growth rate of that $1.4 billion, if you took a five-year view?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I mean as we've said, we think it's sort of a 3% to 5% a year type of free cash flow growth. When I think about free cash flow, Michael, I will tell you, I think about two things. I think about \u2013 and it comes back to our capital allocation program, which is, we can grow free cash flow by doing acquisitions. As Jim Fish like to point out, we basically replaced the Wheelabrator EBITDA, not through acquisitions, but through improvements to our business.", "We'll continue to add a little bit more acquisitions in 2016, as we talked about that $50 million to $70 million of EBITDA. But then I also look at cash flow from a per-share basis. And as we buy back shares, cash flow per share is going to go up. And so as I look at it, when we look at our capital allocation program, we're going to have a nice balance that's going to both increase operating cash flow, but it's also going to increase cash flow per share.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then Jim Trevathan, how would you frame the current on a same-store basis recycling plant capacity utilization? It's got 1,000 tons per day, is it 60% or 80% run-rate, and what can you do to improve that?", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Michael, we're closer to that 80% than 60%. Part of it is volume driven as well, at specific plants. Part of it is shutting down a few plants in cities where we have dual capacity. But that's the goal, and there is still room for improvement there. We won't stop at where we are with, what, 7%, 8% improvement in cost year-to-date. That's still going to go further into 2016.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk of Wedbush Securities.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Good morning, everybody. I don't know if this is a fair question for this morning's call or not, but we'll give a shot and see how we do. If I take a step back and look at the cost improvement side of the equation, and to your point about nearly replacing all of the EBITDA from Wheelabrator, are you suggesting that you're at the goal line on the, sort of the cost \u2013 annual cost improvements in the business, or what's left in the tank?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "No. I wouldn't say that, Al. I'd say that's on the cost side \u2013 first of all, I'll tackle it from OpEx and then SG&A. On the OpEx side, we put \u2013 over the last few years, we put on-board computers in all of these trucks. And I would tell you, we're only kind of at halftime with respect to using the onboard computer to its fullest capability. For example, we can route our trucks dynamically. But that doesn't do any good unless the driver follows the route that the computer generates, and we're only following that route \u2013 if you think about best-in-class, a FedEx or a UPS probably follows the route 95% or 97% of the time. We're kind of about 80% of the time. So, while that may seem like, pretty good, and it is okay, that last 15 to 20 percentage points is worth a lot of money.", "So, there's a lot of process work that's going into \u2013 we've put the technology in place. There is a lot of process improvement that still needs to take place on the OpEx side. Maintenance cost is another component of OpEx, and I would tell you we're probably not at halftime on maintenance costs. We're more like in the first quarter on maintenance costs. We don't use data as well as a lot of companies; a lot of big companies use data to really proactively address maintenance cost, as opposed to reactively addressing, it so you're not breaking down on the road. And we don't use it to the extent that we could. And so there is, I think, a lot of upside with respect to operating cost going forward. Jim Trevathan talked a bit about the upside on the recycling side of our business with cost.", "And then SG&A, look, our goal for the last three years has been to get to a number below 10% of SG&A. I think that's \u2013 because we haven't fully replaced the revenue side of Wheelabrator and the divested businesses, 10% of SG&A is going to be a challenge, but holding flat on SG&A, while we still give our employees a merit increase, is no easy task. And so we plan from 2015 to 2016, again, to hold flat on SG&A, and that's on top of the $60 million that we said we will get this year.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hey, Al, I might add to Jim's mentioning of the onboard units. We were positive in all three lines of business on the collection side in Q3, in efficiency. And we're really starting a hard look at cost per unit and starting to move the needle on a CPU basis, where \u2013 which is where the money is, not just in a unit measurement, on homes per hour, for example. And that'll have a really impact. Volume has helped, but that's not the driver. We're still negative, for example, in residential volume, as Dave mentioned, and yet we were positive on the efficiency side and moving that way on the CPU, with real upside left as we fully implement SDO and some of the process work that'll continue to work across all districts.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Are you able to, or has David put any thresholds in terms of the dollars of cost of operation to come out, either on an annual basis or margin improvement and basis points? I mean all of these \u2013 I appreciate the macro commentary, and I know there was one on truck efficiencies done, that 15 basis points, 20 basis points. But is there any way to help on the operation side, to talk about maybe some goals and where that's at on a quantified basis?", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Al, we don't \u2013 I don't think at this time we're going to give you guidance for 2016. But we absolutely have targets, both in dollars and in metrics, at the area level, at the district level, and all of these we expect improvement and hold people, our sales accountable, as well as our areas, they hold their districts accountable. But this isn't just a shot in the dark, we had absolute dollar and metric goals for each of these metrics.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And in that regard, I would say we're 33% to 40% there on the cost target. Like anything, when you start out with a cost program it is the hardest thing to do in a company. And so we're about 33% to 40% of the way there, but we're pretty confident that we're going to hit that target. It's a multiyear target, we're pretty confident that we'll hit it in the next two years.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Great. We'll certainly be watching, right? How many \u2013 on the acquisition side, did I hear all areas were targets, including energy service and energy waste? Is that fair about what you have in your line of sight, is not \u2013 is more on the solid waste side?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. What I'd say is, we're primarily focused on our traditional solid waste business. But, well, let's now retract that. We are only focused on our core solid waste business. We're not looking to do acquisition outside of our core solid waste business. Right now, what we're looking at mostly is what I'd call our traditional solid waste business, but we do believe that industrial waste and energy services are part of our core solid waste business. But when it comes to industrial waste, we would certainly look at assets in that arena, because that dovetails perfectly with our industrial footprint.", "On the energy services side, I'd tell you that if we were to do a deal in energy services, we'd do an opportunistic deal. We are not actively looking to go out and expand our footprint dramatically in the energy services businesses like we have been in the past. But if we can find some deals that are opportunistic and at the right price, we certainly think that long-term, energy services is going to be a good line of business. It's not going to be a good line of business for the next year or two. So we've got to see something on the long-term horizon at an opportunistic price, if we're going to invest in energy services.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "I don't have much in the way of discussion on hazardous waste. Is that something you're less focused on, or just, it's not imperative from an operational distribution point and collection route down to the type of market?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No, I think, yeah, I think that's exactly right. It is a great line of business that completely overlays our footprint. The reality is that there are a lot more traditional solid waste providers out there that we can buy, than there are industrial waste providers. And so, I wouldn't say that, that we would \u2013 we certainly would not preclude any transaction in industrial waste, but right now we're a little more focused on traditional solid waste.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Okay. I think that's enough for now. Thank you.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown of Raymond James.", "P. Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning, Tyler.", "P. Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey, I don't want to get too caught up in the vernaculars here, but can you give us what average yield was in industrial and commercial? I just assume that including the impact of churn, it's a bit more meaningful as volumes are improving?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. The average yield on the commercial side was 2.6% and on the industrial side was 3%.", "P. Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Perfect. Thank you. And Jim Fish, just a quick clarification, but when you talk about exceeding the $1.5 billion of free cash, are you including or excluding divestitures?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, we're including it. There is a not lot there. It's \u2013 we excluded the big ones last year. So we've always included them, but they are cats and dogs, and add up to not a huge number, but obviously last year we had to exclude them because they were all so big.", "P. Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. But you are including them in the $1.5 billion this year?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Correct.", "P. Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Yeah. Okay. So I'm just curious, so what is exactly exceeding \u2013 what's driving the exceeding of the range? I mean, are you coming in better on cash from ops, or is it that CapEx is tracking towards the lower end, or is it a little bit of both?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "No. It's definitely not the \u2013 it's not the latter for sure. CapEx...", "P. Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "... is kind of at the high end of the range. The range we gave for CapEx was $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. We're at the high end of that range. We may even go a little bit over the top of that range, so it's certainly not because of that range. So it's certainly not because we're tightening down on CapEx. I think it is more \u2013 when I look at EBITDA, that's really, in my mind, kind of the best barometer for how a business is performing, and our EBITDA seems to be performing quite well. Some of it's from yield, and the big puts there are really yield, operating expense.", "And then the takes are kind of poor energy services business, our energy services business could be down as much as 30% for the year. So that's been a big take that we haven't really talked about, but \u2013 and it just nets out against the progress we're making on the others \u2013 on the EBITDA line.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "However the improving volumes have obviously helped as well, on the free cash side.", "P. Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Sure, sure. Okay. Good. So if I think about, though \u2013 and I appreciate that you're giving 2016 guidance, but I'm just looking at the buckets. So if we start from cash from ops of, call it $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion, wherever you guys end up this year, you are going to get back the $40 million of Central States payment that you won't make next year, you're going to get some core EBITDA growth just in the base business, you've got \u2013 we've talked about the M&A that may be in the pipeline, that comes on. And then you are going to lose the $300 million to $400 million of higher cash taxes. And then kind of whatever we think you'll do with that prepay. Is there anything else, big-bucket-wise, though, that I'm missing?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I think working capital, we're making some progress on working capital. There is a lot that runs through that line, but \u2013 and you mentioned one big thing that ran through it this quarter, the Central States pension fund exit. But we're making a lot of progress. It kind of got masked a bit this quarter because of that Central States, but with DPO up 3.9 days and DSO down 1.4 days, it's pretty impressive improvement, considering that it wasn't too long ago, a couple of years ago where we were kind of a 20-day to 25-day difference in the wrong direction, with 45, 47 on DSO and 22 on DPO. We're now up over 30, approaching 31 on DPO and down at 42 on DSO. So that, we shouldn't lose sight of that, that has a big impact on cash.", "P. Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Sure, okay. So working capital might help a little next year as well. Okay. And then on the M&A, I'm just curious, is that $50 million to $70 million of EBITDA with Justice at this point? For review?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes.", "P. Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Or does it have to go to review?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. That level of purchase price, it has to go to Justice. And we do have one transaction that's going through Justice, and some others in the pipeline.", "P. Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Perfect. And then maybe just my last question for Jim Trevathan, but it sounds like your core solid waste business is pretty solid, but I am curious, have you guys seen anything, if even small, a deterioration in the hazardous waste side of the house, or maybe anything on your industrial services lines?", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "No, Tyler, we haven't. It's been very strong for us this year. The base business more so than the event business, we \u2013 our sites are, from a geography standpoint sitting right where most of the construction in the petrochemical industry is occurring. Given the low energy cost, therefore the low feedstock for that petrochemical industry, our Alabama and our Louisiana sites, it's a really good spot for base business as that industry grows. EBIT business in the \u2013 on the West Coast, on the haz sites have been very good, especially the Pacific Northwest, and places in the Southeast maybe not so much, so that's kind of a mixed bag. But we're very happy with that business and expect it to continue to improve.", "P. Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Tyler, we just, Jim \u2013 anecdotally, Jim and I met with some of our big customers a couple of weeks ago over in Louisiana, and those guys are all, as Jim said, kind of the beneficiaries of lower energy pricing. We've got the producers that are \u2013 and the service providers that are kind of taking it on the chin, but you have the consumers that are benefiting, and we met with some big customers of ours who are consumers, and they're very positive about their industrial business with us in 2016. In fact, our haz business, even though it's still small relative to our solid waste business, our haz business is up year-over-year.", "P. Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Yeah, I assume Emelle is very well positioned to capture that petrochemical story over the next few years.", "Unknown Speaker", "", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Lake Charles is better.", "P. Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Yeah, perfect. Okay. And then just lastly, have you guys seen anything on the coal ash side? Is there anything to think about as we look to 2016?", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. I mean look we're in the early stages here of this opportunity. What we are seeing is that it's \u2013 we think it's a good long-term opportunity for us, but it's also a pretty capital-intensive. I guess that can be a good thing, because it serves to differentiate us from some of the small guys that can't put the capital into it, but it still is very early. We're starting to see some of these companies make some decisions about coal ash, and we feel like we're well positioned.", "P. Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay, perfect. Thanks, guys.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Tony Bancroft of Gabelli.", "George Anthony Bancroft - G.research LLC", "Good morning, gentlemen.", "Unknown Speaker", "Good morning.", "Unknown Speaker", "Good morning.", "George Anthony Bancroft - G.research LLC", "On the \u2013 back to the energy waste business, with slower sustained crude prices and customers probably pretty cash-strapped by now, are you seeing any issues with your contracts with them, renegotiations, concessions?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I mean they've come back to us over the last, probably 12 months, and asked for the price concessions. In some cases we've made some price concessions, in some cases we haven't. It's as much of as anything a function of where our assets are relative to the drilling that's taking place. But certainly there has been some real pressure in that business, and that's why our revenue will be down probably 30% for the year.", "George Anthony Bancroft - G.research LLC", "Got it. And then, I know you discussed the M&A on your energy services side. But what would you \u2013 so if a deal were to be done on a one-off basis like you mentioned, what would you \u2013 what would be a \u2013 what's the going rate right now? Could you give me sort of a ballpark, what you'd think to be paying?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Going rate in terms of a multiple, is that what you're asking?", "George Anthony Bancroft - G.research LLC", "Yeah, yeah.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "It's \u2013 I don't know, I'm not sure the multiple changes, but your forecast changes, right? In the other words, it's a multiple of EBITDA, and we aren't paying trailing 12 on EBITDA. What we're going to do is say, okay, let's look at a forecast of what we think's going to happen over the next three-year, five-year, 10-year horizon, and let's discount it forward and figure out a reasonable multiple to pay. But I would tell you, again, when I look at our pipeline of acquisitions, I would say that the pipeline that is the least full would be energy services. I mean, we are not actively looking at any transactions in energy services of any magnitude. And so like I say, we'll be opportunistic, but we're not going to be as actively searching for deals in energy waste as we are going to be actively searching for deals in solid waste.", "George Anthony Bancroft - G.research LLC", "I've got that. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten of Macquarie.", "Adam M. Baumgarten - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one on dividend. I mean, you talked about this sort of 3% to 5% free cash flow growth going forward. I mean, is that what we should expect for the dividend, or could we see some upside there in the years ahead?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, we've always said we want to have a balanced dividend, where we want to have a payout ratio somewhere around 50%. We want to be in the top quartile of S&P 500 dividend-paying companies. We're in that sweet spot right now. We've had pretty consistent growth in our dividend over the last few years, and I'd expect that to continue.", "Adam M. Baumgarten - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Good. Thanks.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "You have a question from the line of Barbara Nov (1:05:29)... \u2013 I'm sorry.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the express written consent of Waste Management is prohibited.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's President and CEO, David Steiner.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. 2015 was a very successful year as our commitment to core pricing, disciplined growth, and controlling cost generated our highest adjusted earnings per share ever. We grew our income from operations and operating EBITDA and achieved the highest operating margins we've seen since 2010.", "We generated earnings per share of $2.61 in spite of the divestitures of our Wheelabrator, Puerto Rico and Eastern Canada operations and headwinds from recycling commodity prices and foreign currency translation.", "In 2015, we saw the execution of pricing, productivity and growth strategy strengthen our foundation in a way that will lead to continued growth in 2016 and beyond.", "During 2015, our strong free cash flow allowed us to return almost $1.3 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. We've seen solid growth in cash generation in our business over the last few years, and we're confident that our free cash flow has reached a new base of at least $1.4 billion per year, up from the $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion level that has characterized the last several years.", "As a result of confidence in our cash flow, our board decided to increase the dividend by 6.5% in 2016 and to authorize up to $1 billion of share repurchases. We acquired Deffenbaugh and several small solid waste companies in 2015. And in early 2016, we closed on the acquisition of Southern Waste Systems or SWS. The acquisition of SWS and other smaller tuck-ins we expect to close in 2016 should generate between $50 million and $75 million of operating EBITDA in 2016.", "As we previously mentioned, the operating EBITDA from these acquisitions won't translate into earnings per share in 2016 because we'll have corresponding intangible amortization. However, the transactions will generate cash flow in 2016 and incremental earnings starting in the second half of 2017.", "Looking at our operations in 2015, our pricing programs continued to drive earnings growth and margin expansion. When we gave initial guidance for 2015, we targeted core price of 3.8% for the full year, and we exceeded that target. For the full year, our collection and disposal core price was 4.2% with yield of 1.8%. We've now seen eight consecutive quarters with core price of 4% or greater. For the full year, core price in the commercial line of business was 6.1%, industrial was 8.6% and the landfill line of business was 2.4%.", "For 2016, we expect core price to be about 4% and total revenue growth from yield should again be in the range of 1.5% to 2%. Our pricing themes continue to perform at high levels, and we'll continue our focus on price in 2016. But pricing excellence is not a one-year project at Waste Management, it's a way of life. We must get pricing to keep up with inflation, and we have the tools and the people to do that indefinitely.", "Our traditional solid waste volumes which include our collection, transfer and landfill volumes were a negative 0.5% for the full year. But importantly, we saw positive trends throughout 2015, with traditional solid waste volumes improving sequentially each quarter, culminating in a slightly positive fourth quarter. Although commercial and residential were still negative, we continue to see positive momentum in those volumes, particularly in our commercial line of business. In that line, we have seen six consecutive quarters in which the rate of decline has improved. And commercial collection was down only 0.7% in the fourth quarter versus down 1.3% in the third quarter. Our continued focus on disciplined volume growth and customer service is paying dividends.", "Our churn was 10.1% for the full year, the lowest level since 2012. In the fourth quarter, it was 9%; the lowest level since 2002. And we did all of this while reducing rollbacks in 2015. So, we're keeping our customers through improved service, not price concessions.", "We saw our new business exceed our lost business for the eighth consecutive quarter. These are all positive signs that our volumes are headed in the right direction without resorting to lowering prices. Total company volume which includes lower margin recycling, brokered, and non-solid waste volume decline 1.6% for the full year, with the fourth quarter being the best quarter of the year, declining only 0.9%.", "For 2016, we expect that traditional solid waste volumes will be positive. However, we do not see a recovery in recycling and non-solid waste volumes which will lead to overall volumes being about flat. Of course, some of the recycling volume that we lose is a direct result of our efforts to shed unprofitable volume. So, losing certain volumes in the recycling business is not such a bad thing. And we expect that overall volumes will turn positive in the second half of the year.", "As you can see, the price and volume trade-off continues to be very positive. For the full year, the company's income from operations grew 4.6%. And our income from operations margin grew 120 basis points. In addition, operating EBITDA increased about 3%. And operating EBITDA margin increased 130 basis points, to 26.5%.", "Our solid EPS growth was achieved despite a $0.09 per share decline from our energy and environmental services business, which has been affected by the sharp decrease in market prices for oil, a negative $0.04 impact from foreign currency translation, and a negative $0.04 impact from recycling operations.", "Looking more closely at recycling, we made significant progress improving operating costs and on renegotiating contractual terms with our customers, including exiting some unprofitable contracts. Our recycling employees worked hard and reduced gross operating expenses by 15%, and changed contracts where possible to allow us to charge a processing fee where we previously paid rebates. Without these operational contractual improvements, we had estimated that the recycling impact could be as much as a negative $0.08 to $0.10 per share ,as average commodity recycling prices declined 17.5% in 2015. However, the operational improvements lessened that negative impact to negative $0.04 per share.", "On the recycling commodity price front, 2016 has seen a continuation of the downward slide, and current prices are down $20 per ton, or 23%, from January of 2015. These are levels that we've not seen in nearly seven years, since the 2009 recession. If we do not see a normal seasonal uptick in commodity prices and prices remain at January levels, this would be a $0.02 to $0.03 headwind in 2016. We're committed to recycling, and we'll continue to work to change the business model to generate revenue that covers our processing costs and drive out operating expenses so that the business is sustainable over the long term.", "Turning to free cash flow. Our strong operating results, coupled with continued discipline in capital spending, allowed us to generate $1.41 billion of free cash flow in 2015. Included in that free cash flow number was a $150 million prepayment of 2016 cash taxes. We had mentioned on the third quarter conference call that we'd make this type of prepayment, given that our cash flow is going to be above the high end of our $1.5 billion range. Consequently, we increased our 2016 guidance to between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion.", "So, when we look at our success in 2015 and our guidance for 2016, we look at three things. First is price. In 2015, we exceeded our goals. And for 2016, it's pretty much locked and loaded and already in process. So, we're very confident we'll meet our 4% target in 2016.", "Second is costs. Again, we did well in 2015. And we believe there's plenty of room to improve in 2016. So, again, we're very confident. And finally, volumes. In 2014 and 2015, we built momentum. And for the first time in many years, I'm very confident that we'll see our volumes turn positive toward the end of 2016.", "So, we go into 2016 with a lot of confidence, and look forward to another strong year. We expect that our continued execution of these strategic priorities will drive 2016 adjusted EPS to between $2.74 and $2.79. And, we expect operating EBITDA to grow at the fastest rate in 10 years, up 5% to $3.6 billion. But we can't do it without our people. I'd be remiss if I didn't thank them for their hard work and professionalism. And I know they will once again prove their value in 2016.", "I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our fourth quarter results and our 2016 outlook in more detail.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, David. We produced solid growth in earnings and cash flow in 2015. And it would've been even better when you realize that recycling is down $0.30 per share from its peak. That is why we need to maintain our focus on fixing recycling. As David said, we're committed to recycling. And for the last two years, we've been working to improve our recycling business. We want to see recycling thrive, because it's the right thing for our environment and it's the right thing for our customers. We just want to make sure it's the right thing for our shareholders.", "We performed well in 2015, navigating the recycling headwinds, which I'll discuss in a moment. But we're in the fourth year of low recycling commodity prices, and we are currently seeing these commodity prices at the lowest levels we've seen since the 2009 recession.", "Since there's little we can do to affect global market conditions, we're doubling down on those areas we can control. We've tightened our belt on investments. We're driving operational efficiencies. We're working with our community partners to reduce the amount of expensive contamination at our MRFs. We're optimizing our MRF network and we're tackling the slow, difficult, but necessary process of changing the terms of our contracts. Together, these actions produce real, measurable results in 2015, and are expected to make recycling profitable over the long term.", "Initially, we expected the headwind in the recycling line of business would be between $0.08 and $0.10 of EPS. However, the full-year impact ended up only $0.04 negative. That was not driven by an improvement in commodity prices, but was due to the actions that we took to improve recycling operations.", "Recycling was one of several market factors we overcame in 2015. In addition to the $0.04 impact from recycling, we had a $0.09 per share headwind related to low demand for energy and environmental services, a $0.04 impact from foreign currency changes. Despite these market pressures, our EPS grew more than 13%, to $2.61 per share in 2015.", "We overcame those headwinds through cost controls and strong growth in our traditional solid waste business, and those efforts will continue into 2016.", "At the beginning of 2015, we expected to see a $60 million improvement in SG&A costs when compared to 2014. I'm pleased with our 2015 results, as SG&A cost for the full year improved $68 million to $1.34 billion, and improved as a percent of revenue by 20 basis points, to 10.4%. For the fourth quarter, SG&A costs were $343 million, an improvement of $27 million compared to 2014. As a percent of revenue, SG&A costs improved 70 basis points, to 10.6%.", "For 2016, we will continue to focus on managing anticipated wage increases, cost inflation, and incremental SG&A brought on from the acquisitions. But despite these increases, we anticipate that SG&A costs should be flat when compared to 2015.", "Turning to cash flow. For the full year, we generated $1.41 billion of free cash flow. As we mentioned on our third quarter earnings call, we expected we would have a strong year of free cash flow and that we would likely make tax payments, assuming the tax extenders were not going to be enacted. Therefore, in the fourth quarter, we prepaid $150 million of 2016 cash taxes.", "For 2016, we now anticipate between $60 million and $70 million of cash tax savings from the impact of bonus depreciation, which was reinstated by Congress at the 11th hour. During 2016, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. In 2016, the impacts of organic earnings growth, bonus depreciation, acquisitions, and higher capital spending should drive free cash flow to between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion. In the fourth quarter, we returned $172 million to our shareholders through our dividends.", "For the full year 2015, we returned about $1.3 billion to our shareholders, consisting of $695 million in dividends and share repurchases of $600 million. Our board has indicated its intention to increase dividends in 2016 by 6.5% to $1.64 per share on an annual basis and this is the 13th consecutive year of increased dividends. In 2016, our anticipated annual dividends will result in approximately $730 million being returned to our shareholders.", "We expect to spend around $100 million to $200 million on tuck-in acquisitions in 2016 with the remainder of free cash flow allocated to share repurchases. We have authorization from our board of directors to repurchase $1 billion of our shares. We've already repurchased $150 million and expect to spend an additional $500 million for the full year.", "Fourth quarter revenues were $3.25 billion. We saw a $59 million increase in revenues from acquisitions and a $50 million increase in our traditional solid waste business due to the combined impacts of pricing and volume.", "We saw an overall revenue decline of $163 million from divestitures, $43 million in lower fuel surcharge revenues, a $34 million decline from lower recycling revenues, and a $33 million decline in foreign currency.", "Looking at internal revenue growth. For the total company in the fourth quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.2% and yield was 1.7%, with total volumes declining 0.9%. This led to total company income from operations growing $42 million, operating income margin expanding 150 basis points to 17.7%, operating EBITDA growing $37 million, and operating EBITDA margin growing 150 basis points to 27%. For the full year, income from operations grew $97 million. Operating income margin expanded 120 basis points, and operating EBITDA grew $86 million, and operating EBITDA margin grew 130 basis points to 26.5%.", "Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefits of our disciplined pricing programs in the fourth quarter. Our commercial core price was 5.8% with yield of 2.9%. Our industrial core price was 8.7% with yield of 2.3%, and residential achieved 2.2% core price and 1.5% yield. Overall, collection core price was 5.3% and yield was 2.2%.", "Our focus on customer service which helped reduce our churn and disciplined growth also benefited our volume trends in the fourth quarter as volume declined only 0.6%. The volume change was a 90-basis point improvement sequentially from the third quarter and a 190-basis point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2014. This core price and volume led to operating EBITDA growing $11.7 million and margin expanding 30 basis points.", "In the landfill line of business, we saw the benefits of both positive volume and positive yield in the fourth quarter just as we have all year. We saw same-store average MSW rates increase year-over-year by 2.4% from Q4 of 2014. This is the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year MSW rate increases.", "Total landfill volumes increased 0.5%, MSW volumes grew by 11.1%, and C&D volume grew 15.8%, while special waste and revenue generated cover volumes declined 7.4%. The special waste decline was predominantly driven by the decline in our energy services business. The positive volume and yield led to income from operations growing $15 million, margins are growing 160 basis points, operating EBITDA increasing $14 million, and operating EBITDA margins increasing 120 basis points.", "Moving now to operating expenses. These expenses improved by $50 million in the fourth quarter and as a percent of revenue improved 80 basis points to 62.4%. For the full year, operating expenses improved $328 million and as a percent of revenue improved 100 basis points to 63.1%. In 2015, our focus on improving operating costs saw a significant traction and we expect that to continue into 2016. For the full year, we saw improvements of $187 million in fuel costs, $102 million in cost of goods sold, and $35 million in labor costs as we continue to see the benefits from our routing and logistics program.", "Finally, looking at our other financial metrics. At the end of the fourth quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.66 and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.32%. A floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 8% at the end of the quarter.", "The effective tax rate was approximately 32.4% in the fourth quarter and 32.3% for the full year. Taxes were a $0.01 headwind to EPS in the fourth quarter.", "In conclusion, 2015 was a very good year for waste management. As our employees did a great job on focusing on price, disciplined growth and cost controls. I want to say thank you to our employees for their hard work in delivering a successful 2015 and positioning us to continue that into 2016. We're excited about continued growth from 2016 and beyond. And with that, Karnethia, let's open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question is from Scott Levine with Imperial Capital.", "Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "Good morning, guys.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning, Scott.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Scott.", "Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "So, it seems like steady-as-she-goes in terms of the organic growth trends, that the pricing environment is pretty healthy, that the volume environment is generally improving, and is expected to improve albeit gradually with volumes inflecting positive by the end of this year. But anything surprising, either to the positive or the negative on the macro or the industry front either geographically or relative to your expectations \u2013 or really, are things just kind of continuing to improve at a gradual pace, and there is no real change in the operating environment in general?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Scott, when I look at the business, you can sort of say, I think your right, the growth is fairly muted from the economy. But you can pretty much say, the business is firing on all cylinders save two areas, and that's recycling and energy services. And I think we all know what the macroenvironments are for that. I mean, it's low commodity prices, not just oil but cardboard and plastics. So, I think you hit the nail in the head. It's steady-as-she-goes. We continue to see the other lines of business doing very well and we don't expect that to end in 2016.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Scott, I would say that the only thing that was surprising was kind of a positive, we weren't surprised obviously by the headwinds with recycling or energy services. But we were pleasantly surprised, when you look at the construction business, I mentioned we were up over 15% in C&D waste stream. And that really, to us, is kind of a foreshadowing of good things there in 2016.", "Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "Understood. And then, it sounds like you're baking in an expectation here of $50 million to $75 million EBITDA. You've been talking about this for a while. Could you tell us how \u2013 how much of this have you closed on with the SWS acquisition? How much remains to be closed? And maybe a little bit more commentary regarding the M&A landscape in general and whether we may see some upside to your $100 million or $200 million spend or valuations in the marketplace, a little bit more color there.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I would say 80% to 90% of it is locked in with SWS. I mean, that's going to be the big acquisition that we do in 2016. When I look at acquisitions, we've done RCI in Montreal. We did Deffenbaugh in Kansas City. And now, we've done SWS in South Florida. And those were spectacular acquisitions for us because they're a fairly large amount of revenue but they're also straight tuck-ins into our business.", "And so, we know exactly how to do them. We know exactly how to get the dollars out. It takes a little bit of time but we know exactly how to do them. So the more of those that we can do, the better. We thought there might be a few more of those in the pipeline but those, call them, those $400 million to $500 million transactions, we really don't see a lot of those on the near horizon right now. So, I think 2016 will be a year where it's mostly driven by tuck-in acquisitions. But again, we'd love to do some larger acquisitions like those three that we did in Montreal, Kansas City and South Florida.", "Pricing, I don't think it's changed dramatically. We've said it many times, we generally pay a little bit lower price for those smaller tuck-ins and it's because you can pay a little bit higher price when you get that bigger bulk of business like we did down at SWS although even with SWS, on a post-synergy basis, we'll end up paying sort of 6 to 7 times EBITDA.", "Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "Got it. And as a follow-on to that, assuming \u2013 is there any change in your interest level in energy and industrial and \u2013 or if we get a floor in commodity prices on the energy side, could we see your interest pick up as 2016 plays out or you're still focused predominantly on solid waste?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. We're focused predominantly on solid waste and I think we've said it the last two conference calls which is, look, long-term I think energy services will be a great business. But we're not out there looking for businesses. I think it's going to be a prolonged, flattening of oil prices. And so \u2013 and energy services, if we buy something in energy services, it would be opportunistic. We're not actively out searching for businesses in that line of business.", "Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "Got it. Thanks, David.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Corey Greendale with First Analysis.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Hey. Good morning, everyone.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Corey.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hi, Corey.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "So, two questions. First, Jim, I was hoping \u2013 Jim Fish, I was hoping you could help bridge the cash flow from ops guidance from 2015 and 2016. I calculate your guiding to a $300 million to $400 million increase EBITDA, your guiding to $160 million, so just what's accounting for the rest of the increase?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, so when we look at cash flow from ops or if I look at free cash flow because I want to include in there, CapEx, if I talk about free cash flow \u2013 and if that doesn't answer your question, let me know, but if I talk about free cash flow for 2016, I have a starting point of let's call it $1.41 billion from this year. And then I'm adding in EBITDA growth. You mentioned $160 million, we're kind of calling it $170 million in EBITDA growth year-over-year which includes \u2013 that includes organic growth, that includes some of the benefit of acquisitions. I add in the impact of bonus depreciation which I mentioned was let's call it $70 million. And then our CapEx is going to be a bit higher this year. I mentioned the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion range, so back out $100 million in added CapEx, I arrive in the middle of that range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion.", "And keep in mind there, Corey, that the prepayments that we made in cash taxes is really offset by the benefit we got from the Q1 2015 debt transaction. So, those two kind of offset each other so that walk-forward works without a cash tax, the cash tax difference.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "That did it for my question. Thank you. And one clarification. I think you've said this, but the EBITDA that you're expecting to get from acquisitions, the number that you gave, is that only from Southern and new acquisitions? So, in other words, you're not including rollover effect of acquisitions in 2015?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, there's a small rollover effect from 2015 but the bulk of it would be the SWS and the tuck-ins we do in 2016.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Okay. Then next question, you addressed the environment in general when you were answering Scott's questions. But given that we have a lower \u2013 a low CPI environment, you're committed to continuing, like you said, pricing is not a temporary thing, it's the culture. I guess the question is how confident are you that you won't be pushing away more volumes as the year goes on given that CPI will be quite low?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Well, look, we've done it the last three years consecutively. We've seen our churn rate come down while we've maintained that core price at 4% plus. And so, look, it really comes down to making sure that you service your customer. I mean, if your customer is happy, they completely understand that our costs go up every year, and you've got to get those price increases. And we've always said that it's a fairly small portion of our customers' overall cost structure.", "So, getting that price increase to maintain inflation plus really hasn't been difficult as long as you can maintain the service levels to the customers. And so, that's really where we're focused this year. We know how to get the 4% core price. We've got those plans, like I said, locked, loaded, and we're already executing them. So, we know we can do that.", "The key is having that great customer service which allows you to keep that low churn rate, also keep price rollbacks down and get that positive core price. And so, like I say, we've got it sort of clicking on all cylinders, but we can always do better.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Great. And then on the kind of competitive and acquisition front, David, I'd just love to get your thoughts on whether the proposed Connections acquisition of Progressive has any impact on those markets and also whether you might be interested in some of the potential slots that may be coming out from that?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Look, I think Ron did a spectacular job in picking up that business and everywhere that we compete with Waste Connections, they are a tough competitor but they are a fair competitor, and so we certainly welcome them into the markets. I don't know how to say welcome in Canadian but we welcome them into the markets.", "But the other thing is I would love \u2013 I'm glad you brought it up. I owe Ron a phone call to let him know that to the extent that they have to get rid of any business that we would certainly be interested in buying any pieces of those business that we can buy. So I'll make sure to give him a call today and let him know that.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Great. Let me know if you need his phone number, I can send that to you. And then just one last quick one, if you don't mind. I'm whipsawing back to Jim Fish. Given the EBITDA guidance, I'm coming out at a slightly different place on EPS. I was hoping you might be able to give us some sense of what you're assuming on interest expense and share repurchases?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Interest expense will be up slightly. We finished the year at $384 million in interest \u2013 cash interest. They will be up slightly, not a lot, maybe call it $5 million and then share repurchase, look, we said that we'd probably repurchase \u2013 we've already done $150 million. We said we'll probably do another $500 million on top of that for a total of $650 million, which kind of approximates what we bought last year. We bought $600 million last year. We have authorization for $1 billion, probably won't spend the full $1 billion in 2016.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Got it. Okay. That actually moves me in the wrong \u2013 is there anything going on in the equity income or loss line, or anything else below the line that's changing meaningfully from 2015?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "No. Not that I can think of. Maybe we can reconcile it for you. If I look at EPS, I mean, that's what you're concerned about, right, is EPS?", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Yes.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "If I look at EPS, from $2.47 to $2.61, we had divestitures that were worth $0.18, so I'm backing those out. And then, we had \u2013 and I'm reconciling 2014 to 2015 for you here. But then, we had shares and interest. We had traditional solid waste growth of $0.08. We had some unusual items. Specifically, our energy services business was $0.09. And then, when I look at moving from $2.61 up to our range of $2.75 to $2.79, I'm really adding in the kind of our traditional solid waste growth that we expect, and we talked about on the EBITDA line. So, hopefully that helps.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Yeah. That's fine. I'll let you move on. If I come up with a question that I could ask otherwise, I will follow up offline. Thanks, guys. Thanks for the time.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Tyler Brown with Raymond James.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, guys.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey, David. Just want to dig in a little bit more on the relationship between core price and yield. So, if we go back and look over the last few quarters, including Q4, it looks like the spread between core price and average yields actually widened out. And at least from an outside perspective, it just looks like you're keeping less and less of that core price increase.", "Can you guys talk a little bit about that relationship and why that spread is widening out? I mean, it sounds like churn is actually trending well, and the gap between new and lost business isn't widening. So, is it mix or what's going on there?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, you hit the nail on the head with mix. The reason we moved to core price is because core price is really an indicator of the price increases that we put across our current customer base. To go from core price to yield, you then put in \u2013 because we do it on a per-unit basis, you then come in to a lot of things like mix. And so, the biggest thing that we think drove the disparity between the core price and yield was the fact that our energy services business was down fairly dramatically, and those are very high-priced hauls.", "Compared to \u2013 if you look at an energy service haul compared to an industrial container at a shopping mall, the price per haul difference is dramatic. And so, the fact that energy services dropped off, as we said, $0.09 for the year, when you saw that dramatic drop-off in energy services, you lost a lot of those very high-priced pulls, and that's where the biggest chunk of the disparity between core price and yield comes in.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Yeah. No. That's very helpful. And then, Jim Fish, just can you help us out a little bit on cash taxes? You got lots of moving pieces here. So, first off, just simply, what was cash taxes paid in 2015? And then what is exactly contemplated in the guidance, just the total dollar number, just ballpark?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "2015 was $434 million. So, if you assume that we've got the offsets for 2016, 2016 is going to look like kind of that $433 million. We'll get a benefit of about $70 million from bonus depreciation. And then a piece of kind of incremental taxes on earnings gets us to a cash tax figure of around $400 million, is our expectation for 2016.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Good. That actually answered my next question, so I'll kind of move on here. But just David, really quick, can you guys talk about where you are on the coal ash front? And is this \u2013 well, first off, how much did you move in 2015, if any? And then, is this a key driver in your confidence in back half volume growth?", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, so, we're seeing \u2013 it was a piece of our growth in 2015, not a huge piece. We've got one customer that has started with us. We've got three different plants that we're working with them on. Really, one of them was started in June, the other one started kind of November, December, and then the third will start in 2016. So, not a huge impact for us. And we're kind of seeing the public utilities move at varying paces here, in terms of remediation on that side of their business.", "Recall there is this \u2013 there's another side of their business, which is the perpetuity. And so, we can use either on-site management for their continuing needs, we can manage it off site through our landfills, or we can offer them beneficial reuse. So, we're equipped to handle all three. We think that will ramp up in 2016, but not a huge impact in 2015.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Okay, good. And then, just, Jim, lastly. How much did you pay for SWS? Just what will we see on the cash flow statement in Q1?", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "We paid $516 million for SWS.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Perfect. Thanks, guys.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Jeff Volshteyn with JPMorgan.", "Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "I wanted to ask around the industrial side of the business, industrial waste space doing well. What I wanted to find out is just kind of an update on how much of your business is directly linked to the industrial economy? And when you look at the portions of the industrial (41:21) perm business, temp business, what do you see in 2016?", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, it's interesting when you look at our industrial. Our industrial line of business, as we look at it, includes a couple of different business types. It includes large retailers, it includes manufacturing and industrial. It includes construction, and it includes energy services. And those really were \u2013 there was a wide spectrum there. Construction, as I mentioned earlier, really finished the year on a high note. So, we're very happy with that, and it looks like it's going to do well going forward. The large retailers were pretty solid, as was manufacturing and industrial. Looks like \u2013 industrial production figures came out today, and looks like they're decent, and that's kind of what we saw as well, pretty solid in manufacturing and industrial.", "The one real soft spot, and you'll hear it several times today, was energy services, and it got worse throughout the year. So, we were down 32% in our energy services business, albeit on a kind of a small base there, but down 32%, and down 45% in the fourth quarter. And looking through that kind of small lens, we don't see energy services getting much better in 2016.", "But overall, if you want to think about how we talk about industrial, it was \u2013 it more than compensated for the downturn in energy services.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think everybody gets concerned that there's going to be some kind of industrial recession. I mean, look, in our business, what you had happen last year was obviously, you had the inventory build and then working off the inventory. And that's what I think drove everybody to say, oh, gosh, what's going on in the manufacturing sector. As Jim pointed out, you saw some good numbers from it today.", "But when they build up the inventory and then they work down the inventory, they don't shut down their plants. They still operate their plants. And so that really just doesn't have that big of an effect on us. It doesn't have an effect on us until they shut down the plants. And I don't think anyone's seeing a shutdown of plants. I think they're seeing a little bit of a slowdown of the plants. And so when we look at our industrial waste, it really isn't going to be affected by the manufacturing and industrial space.", "And then the final piece is that a lot of the low energy prices are a big boon to a lot of the manufacturing and industrial customers that we have in the chemical corridor all the way from Beaumont, Texas up through the Midwest. And so, we see the manufacturing and industrial volumes actually being very strong. As Jim said, we've got a wide spectrum from extremely strong construction to weak on the energy services side. And manufacturing and industrial I'd say would come in on sort of the slightly positive side of that spectrum. So, we don't see that particularly slowing in 2016. And we expect industrial volumes to continue to be positive in 2016.", "Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "That's very helpful. Just following up on the commentary, I think from the last quarter. You talked about some situations with shortage of drivers in the industrial side of the business. Is that a material headwind heading into 2016?", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "No, I'll jump in, Jeff. It is a headwind, but it's a weakened headwind. We are doing much better in that regard. The oil field services decline in 2015 has helped us in that regard in those markets where that kind of business exist as drivers have become more available. It's still in some of the larger \u2013 the higher growth markets, it's an issue for us, but we're working through it much better in late 2015, and then we expect too in 2016 better than in that 2013-2014 period when the oil field service business was booming. We'll manage right through it and we'll continue to grow our business on that industrial side with new drivers.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "But look, it's a good problem to have, right? I mean, that tells you there's strong demand out there. We'll take that problem six days to Sunday rather than the alternative.", "Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "One more question for me, if I may. On the CapEx side of the business, looking into 2016, are there any sizable differences in sort of in the buckets of investments compared to 2015?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "No, not anything sizable. We'll spend a little more on fleet capital, probably $20 million more on fleet capital. We've got about $15 million that is related to Deffenbaugh and SWS acquisition that we'll spend. And part of the reason we were a little lower than our guidance back at the end of Q3 in CapEx for 2015 was that we had some CapEx that was accrued and the cash didn't actually go out the door until Q1. So, we'll have a little bit of carryover and that's really what gets us from that $1.23 billion CapEx number from 2015, up to kind of the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Jim, maybe just a little more color around the fleet side of our business. Our supply chain folks and our field people have worked really well together. In 2015, for example, we purchased 12% more trucks than we did in 2015, but for the same total dollars as we expended in 2014. In 2015, we bought 1,124 trucks, about 11% average reduced price per truck than 2014. So, we're doing some standardization around the fleet. It's helped us in that regard and some commitments to our suppliers that helped us with that reduction. In 2016, we'll buy 1,234 trucks, according to the current plan. And it's about 10% more than 2015, but we'll only spend about 4% more in dollars than we did in 2015. So, we're making real progress there and we're investing in the fleet. But we're just doing it more efficiently.", "Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "That's very helpful. Last one from me, I promise. What is the impact of the one \u2013 or the leap day in the first quarter?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "The impact on what?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Leap day.", "Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Leap day. One extra day.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. We actually have one extra day total in the quarter. We had one fewer in January, we have one extra in both February and March. And, theoretically, that extra workday probably costs us a little bit of money, because our cost structure is a little bit higher than the additional revenue that we'd get. But it shouldn't have a material effect on the quarter.", "Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Michael Hoffman with Stifel.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thank you very much, David, Jim and Jim for taking my questions. Jim Fish, on the free cash, if you were to pull out cash taxes entirely and look back over a trend, how would you characterize the growth rate of your free cash ex the variability any given year of cash taxes, what's happening operationally before the tax impact?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I guess I would focus on EBITDA for that question, Michael, because really, that's where \u2013 that's the biggest component and that's where we spend most of our time, is on EBITDA. And we saw EBITDA grow nicely last year, kind of in that 3% range, and we see it's \u2013 we see it replicating that again organically and then we'll have some EBITDA growth from these acquisitions in 2016.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. With that said, then if I looked at your expectation for the $3.6 billion in 2016, what is the underlying margin assumption in the EBIT and the EBITDA?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So, EBITDA would \u2013 you know, look, if you \u2013 there's always the question of what happens to the top line. If we don't have these kind of top line impacts that are kind of out of our control such as foreign currency and fuel surcharge, if you assume the top line doesn't have those, we'd expect to see EBITDA margins improved somewhere between 50 and 100 basis points.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And EBIT, what about the EBIT margin?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I don't have a number for your there, Michael. I'll have to get back to you on that.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Behind that question is, does D&A stay flat on a percent of revenues or is it up or down with the mix shifts that are going on?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. It should stay pretty flat on a percent of revenue basis.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then when I think about that question that's been asked a couple different ways, what is your share count in your assumption for $2.75 to $2.79?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Share count at the end of last year was 455 million shares and in our plan, we've got 445 million shares.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then if you did spend $1 billion, it would imply that you would borrow money to do that. That's the right interpretation. Correct?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I guess...", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "It depends how the cash plays out during the year and then when you buy the shares, right? And so, what we've said is that we're going to basically spend \u2013 we aren't necessarily going to spend the whole $1 billion. We will spend the difference between dividends and what we do in acquisitions from \u2013 subtract that from the total cash flow and the remainder will go to the stock buyback.", "And so, we're sort of planning on the $600 million type of dollars on the share buyback. If we go above that, we'd either have to generate more cash or have less capital in the year, or we'd have to borrow it. But right now, when we draw down on our revolver, we're drawing down at 1%. Our balance sheet at 2.66 times is in great condition. So, we don't have any intention to borrow, to buy shares. But certainly, we have the ability to do it.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Well, I guess where I was coming from on that, I don't necessarily think it's a bad thing because you're delevering naturally and there seems to be logic in leverage in a 2.5 times to 3 times just from a cash tax planning standpoint. The rate of the improvement you're delevering pretty quickly.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Absolutely.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. I mean, Michael, if you look at our \u2013 if you look at free cash flow and you just take the middle of the range of $1.55 billion and back out dividends of $730 million, let's back out \u2013 we've kind of said $100 million to $200 million in tuck-ins, so let's back out $150 million for that, that gives you $670 million. That's kind of right where we've discussed today would be share repurchase.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. All right. And then the one sort of in the weeds question around the industrial side, is you do operate five hazardous waste landfills, what's the trend been volume-wise there?", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Michael, Jim Trevathan. It's been as we ended the year and as you saw some of the petrochemical plants gearing up some with a low \u2013 their low feedstock cost, it's been okay. We've done fine at both Emelle in Alabama, Lake Charles in Louisiana. Kettleman has got the new permit and online and adding some volume.", "So, overall, that business is doing well for us. It's not as you know a huge part of our total revenue, but it's an important part because it differentiates us from those large \u2013 four of those large customers with capability to handle everything from their trash and recycling to their hazardous waste. And they like our balance sheet, as we just talked about. And our capabilities are full for them. So, it's been a \u2013 it's a good part of our company and we expect to grow it.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "It has been very nice for us, Michael. And, frankly, if I look at the various pieces of businesses and think, can they get better or worse? This is one that I think can get better, both organically just because of the growth in the volumes. But we can also extend the reach of these landfills. Right now, we've got fairly limited reach without transfer capabilities. And over time, if we can improve those transfer capabilities, we can extend the reach of our hazardous landfills, and both grow volumes because we see growth in overall volumes but also because we can extend our reach and take volumes out of further-away geographies.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, and Michael, an example of that, of our commitment to that business is in the fourth quarter, we did a small tuck-in kind of transaction and acquisition in California that helps us with internalize some volume at that new Kettleman-permitted space. So, we are committed to that business, to growing it and looking for opportunities in that regard.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then, Jim Trevathan, while I've got you, if we're 50 to 100 basis point margin improvement, you're getting 20 basis points out of G&A, per Jim Fish, the rest has got to come from ops. Some of it's fuel because they clearly \u2013 they've got a favorable trend. But where would I look in the line items to see that incremental improvement coming from?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "One area, Michael, is labor. If you look at all three collection lines of business in 2015, we were positive in efficiency in all three, with obviously a couple of them still negative in volume. That's one excellent indication. If you look at those three lines of business, collection lines are a cost per unit business, all three of them, are in that 1% range and with inflation, just driver labor cost in the 2%, 2.5% range, that's a pretty good number, and you see that in our labor cost improvement.", "We rolled out our SDO initiative across all 17 areas, service delivery optimization. We're focused on two things in that regard. Let's sustain it where we have it working well and let's improve it. Let's find best practices as areas have implemented it now for a couple of years, and we're looking for new ways to utilize some of the logistics and the technology that our corporate operating team is providing us to get more labor cost out of that and continue to improve on the efficiency.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question is from Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Sean J. Egan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, gentlemen. It's Sean Egan on for Joe Box.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hi, Sean.", "Sean J. Egan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "I wanted to dig in a little bit into your pricing guidance for 2016. Looking at that 4% versus the 4.2% posted in 2015, is that sequentially lower simply due to lapping more difficult comparisons? Is it conservatism on your part? Any color there would be appreciated.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Look, 4% has sort of have been our target for the last three to four years. And so, we want to maintain that target. We obviously overshot that target in 2015. I'm virtually certain we'll get that 4% in 2016. If we were going to not hit that target, the question is would it be lower or higher than that target. I'm also very confident that if we miss the target, we're going to miss on the high side not on the low side.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "But I don't think there's anything to read into the difference between 4.2% and 4.0%.", "Sean J. Egan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. Thank you. And then kind of piggybacking on that with respect to yield, outside of CPI, can you maybe help us understand what some of largest drags would be to beating that 2% top of the range? I mean, would it be the mix that you talked about earlier with the energy business? Any (57:15) there is helpful.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. The two biggest components of that would be mix, and then new business pricing versus lost business pricing. Those are two big components that go \u2013 that don't affect the price increase that you're putting on your current line of business but that does affect yield. And so that would be \u2013 it would be mix and the difference between new business pricing and lost business pricing.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "And, David, if I added a third to that, it would be rollbacks. And we've managed those really well over the last couple of years. We're positive in 2015 versus 2014 and we expect that trend to continue.", "Sean J. Egan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Got you. So, what you just alluded to earlier, the new business pricing, how is that holding in, say, compared to a year ago?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Our goal is to drive that new business pricing to 10% or under. And I would say right now, we're sort of at the high end of that. As the economy improves and as we've seen a good pricing environment, I would expect us to over time to be under that. But right now, we're sort of at the high end of that 10% discount.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "And, Joe, if I add a little more color, the industrial line of business, the roll-off line, we're within that target with the commercial side just outside it and working hard to improve it.", "Sean J. Egan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Great. And then I wanted to talk a bit about recycling volumes. Just curious where, if you know, the recycling volumes might be going that you have shedded in favor of price. Are customers choosing not to recycle? Are they choosing independent operators? If you have any sense of where it's going, that would be helpful.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Most of the volume that we've lost have been large residential contracts, and that volume is turning into net losses for our competition.", "Sean J. Egan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Understood.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I can promise you, we know what those prices were bid at. And at these commodity prices, there is nobody making money on those contracts that we gave up.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Especially, Dave, with the capital required.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Exactly.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "With a new contract, where typically that customer wants new trucks, we make that decision around return on invested capital, as well as margin.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And, frankly, those contracts, just to be very clear, those contracts generally have not been lost to our solid waste competition. They've been lost to people that are solely in the recycling business. And if you're solely in the recycling business and you take on another underwater contract, you can see that story is not going to end very well for those folks.", "Sean J. Egan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Understood. That's all for me. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Al Kaschalk with Wedbush.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Good morning, guys.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Al.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hi.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "David, I have one simple question.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No, you don't.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Why can't Waste Management post positive volumes like their peer group?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Look, this is an easy question to answer. Because you can't look at just a volume number. You've got to look at, what is that volume made up of, right? If that volume is made up of brokered volumes, you're not making any money on it. If that volume is made up of recycling volumes, you're not making any money on it. And so, when I look at the volumes, I don't say, look at the overall volume number, I say, look where the volumes are coming from. So for us, we've got positive volumes in the industrial line, which is a very high-margin line for us. We've got positive volumes in the landfill line, which is the highest margin business that we have. And we're about to turn the corner to get positive volumes on the commercial line. We're at negative 0.7% in the quarter. I would expect to see that turn positive during 2016.", "So, we're adding volume in the high margin areas. We are losing volume in recycling. We're losing volume in brokered businesses and we're losing volume in non-core. All very low margin businesses. And so, if you get positive volume and margins go backwards, I don't see that as a good volume report. If you get negative volumes and margins go up by 150 basis points, I view that as fairly positive.", "So, I think it's a very easy question to answer. We look for volumes where we can make money on those volumes. We don't look for volumes for the sake of volumes. And so \u2013 but, having said all that, in those money-making volumes, we're going to see the overall volume number turn positive in 2016, and that's what I look forward to. Look, this is a high fixed cost business, and layering in that volume on the high fixed cost allows you to drop a big flow-through to the bottom line.", "So, I think we've done the right thing. We'll continue to do the right thing. We'll continue to add volumes where we can make money.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Hence the progression on EBITDA margin.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Exactly.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "I guess (62:28).", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Exactly.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Right. As a follow-up \u2013 thank you for that. I guess I have a second question then.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I told you.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "The commentary around the industrial environment economy, and yourselves being opportunistic when you can, why would you not, or are you suggesting to keep our eyes open, on being more aggressive on that hazardous piece of your business which, I guess would be \u2013 I don't know if I'd say is as profitable, but maybe you could articulate that for us? But why wouldn't you get more aggressive on acquisitions on that front?", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, I'll jump in. I mentioned earlier that we did, as we added airspace at Kettleman in California, we went out and found the right tuck-in for us to add volume. So we invested in that business in the second half of 2015, and we'll continue to look for those opportunities that can improve both our margin, but our returns, especially.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "But, look, what we need to do in our hazardous waste line of business is, we need to develop a national transfer network so that we can leverage our landfills. We would love nothing more than to be able to buy that and go very quickly to do that. But there's just not a lot of businesses out there that meet those needs and that are for sale.", "So, in the meantime, we're going to do it organically. And so, we're going to \u2013 we're going to grow that network one way or another. But right now, given the state of the acquisition market right now, we're going to do that organically.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Great. Good luck, guys, and thanks for your time.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Al.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Charles Redding with BB&T Capital Markets.", "Charles Edgerton Redding - BB&T Capital Markets", "Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my question.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Charles Edgerton Redding - BB&T Capital Markets", "Perhaps just a follow-up on transportation, how should we think about the impact on Northeast landfilling volume from the lower transportation costs? And then with reduced diesel, is it fair to expect collectors to bypass closer incineration units really in favor of the longer haul sites, just based on price alone?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, when you see the transportation costs go down, which is what happens with the fuel, you basically open up landfills that are further away, right? And so, we've actually seen pretty nice growth in our Northeastern landfills. I'm not sure that I'd attribute it 100% to the lower transportation costs, but we've seen nice volumes both in our Northeastern network and then in our Southern network. We would expect that \u2013 we'd expect that to continue into 2016. I always say, to a certain extent, low fuel prices are both good for the economy, but they're also good for our business.", "Charles Edgerton Redding - BB&T Capital Markets", "Great. And just a follow-up, with apologies, on energy services, can you be a little more specific in terms of those types of hauls that are seeing the most pressure from lower spending, and maybe too early to think about any nascent stabilization here year-to-date?", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "The types of haul that are seeing lower spending \u2013 look, we haul \u2013 most of what we haul is drill cuttings. And then we haul some waters, we haul a little bit of NGL. So, clearly, the big piece that has declined is drill cuttings. But what's happened is, you're seeing these \u2013 the rig count has dropped off by 60%. So, they are not drilling. They may be leasing property, but they're not drilling nearly as much as they were a year ago. And so, as a consequence, the drill cuttings coming out of those holes are not moving to our landfills. So, I think that answers your question. It is \u2013 because it's the majority of our energy services business, that is what's causing the biggest drop-off.", "Charles Edgerton Redding - BB&T Capital Markets", "Great. Thanks for the time.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Tony Bancroft with Gabelli & Company.", "Tony Bancroft - Gabelli & Company", "Thanks. Could you please add just some little more color maybe on the renegotiations for your recycling some of the lower \u2013 the unprofitable recycling contracts and CPI-linked contracts? I realize that you said it's a small portion of the customers' cost structure and you guys in general are more prone to not \u2013 you said \u2013 you always previously said that if you can't do anything at CPI, you'll go get it somewhere else. But maybe just like, where are we, in a sense, maybe on a percentage, maybe some kind of gauge where on a percentage basis of what needs to be renegotiated and how far along you are? Is there some kind of maybe general big picture, inning type thing of where you are along in that?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. On the recycling front, I would say we're about 75% to 80% through renegotiating the contracts. And the contracts that we haven't renegotiated, we can't do anything more about, because they're basically sort of long term contracts and we just have to eat the losses on those contracts until the contracts come up for bid and hopefully at a higher rate or they will go to someone else who is welcome to lose money on them. And so, on the recycling front, we're probably about 75% to 80% through.", "On the CPI front, about 20% of our business \u2013 our CPI-related business is either on a floating index that more approximates the Waste Services Index or they're on a fixed price increase track with over 2.5% fixed price increases. In other words, 2.5% is sort of our inflation rate. About 20% of our contracts are either on a CPI-based measure or \u2013 that is not CPI but would be, for example, the Waste and Water Index or what we call a Solid Waste Index. And so, that runs at a higher rate generally than our 2.5% inflation.", "And then, we've got other contracts where they run higher than our 2.5% inflation because they have fixed price increases at over 2.5%. So, about 20% of our business is under those types of contracts. So, there's still a lot of room to go on the residential and on the national account side to get those CPI contracts moved up but we're about 20% through it.", "Tony Bancroft - Gabelli & Company", "That's great. Thanks, guys.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Barbara Noverini with Morningstar.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Good morning, everybody.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Somewhat related to the last question but if we're looking at a lower-for-longer commodity price scenario for recycling, how much further can you take the operational improvements that you've been speaking about? Would you have to consider more aggressive restructuring actions or is there still a lot of runway for this sort of operational cost saving, customer education, et cetera, that you've been describing?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. When we look at recycling, we've made some great improvements. I think there's still plenty of room for improvement. But at this point in time, basically what we're down to is we have a series of plants and those series of plants generally revolve around a large contract, a large municipal contract or other contracts. So if we lose that large municipal contract, absolutely, we would probably have to shut down that plant because we don't have enough volume going through that plant.", "We don't have any that we have on the early time horizon where we think that will happen but that's basically how we'll have to respond to a low-for-long commodity price. We still have operational improvements we can make. We think we can pull out sort of that 5% to 10% operating cost for a few years. But then any bigger restructuring, we don't have any planned right now. If we did any of that, it would be based upon large contract losses that we would have if we have those.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "And just a reminder, we have consolidated over the last two years roughly 20% of the total number of facilities. Most of them smaller, but where we've either lost on profitable volume and can move the remaining good volume into a larger facility in the same MSA. So, we've already done some of the physical rationalization. And we're working towards the operational side of efficiency now.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "But let's not lose sight of the fact that if the industry changes, what we've said is we won't bid contracts unless we can be guaranteed that we recover our processing cost, and then we'll split \u2013 and a margin of profit, and then we'll split any excess with the customers. But if there is no excess, then the customers are going to have pay for the processing and profitability. If we can get contracts on those terms, we're not going to be shutting down plants. We'll be adding plants.", "And so, what we're trying to get to is how we can make this business sustainable for the long run. I think we've done a spectacular job with our recycling folks of doing that. I'm a firm believer that the industry is going to follow just because the economics don't allow them to do anything different than what we're doing. And so, I think over the long haul, even in a lower, longer commodity price environment, I think we can grow recycling. So, we're looking forward to doing that over the next few years rather than shrinking our footprint.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Yeah. That makes sense. Thanks for the additional detail.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no questions.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks. Well, just in closing, as we said, we're real confident that we can hit our targets in 2016. For the most part, everything seems to be clicking on all cylinders. But you can't do it just because you have a good economic environment, or you can't do it just because you have the best assets in the business.", "You absolutely have to have the right team to execute. And so, I'd say all the way from our senior team here in Houston and out in the field, all the way down to our leadership out in the field, all the way down to our frontlines, we've got the right team, and that's why we're so confident that we're going to grow this business in 2016 and well into the future.

Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Ed. And good morning from Houston. Our first quarter results continued the positive trends that we saw throughout 2015, and our volumes turned positive more quickly than we had originally planned. We also saw the continued strength on our pricing programs and our cost programs continue to gain traction. This focus on disciplined growth, pricing and continuous cost improvement delivered $0.58 per share in the quarter, an increase of more than 18% from our 2015 first quarter results.", "Our revenue increased for the first time since 2014, and we achieved positive volumes for the first time since 2012. Our employees are doing a great job of managing cost increases to drive earnings growth and margin expansion.", "In the first quarter, we saw improvement in virtually every financial metric that we track. Our traditional solid waste business income from operations increased $60 million and margin increased 30 basis points, and our operating EBITDA improved $90 million and margin increased 50 basis points. We're very pleased with our first quarter results as they provide a strong start to 2016.", "Turning to our operations. Our pricing programs continued to drive earnings growth and margin expansion. For the first quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 5.3% and yield was 2.6%. Core price improved 90 basis points from the first quarter of 2015 to the highest level that we've achieved. And we also saw the highest core price ever in each of the commercial, industrial, and landfill lines of business. Core price in the industrial line was 10.7%; in the commercial line, it was 7.5%; in our landfill line, it was 3.3%; and in our residential line, it was 2.6%.", "As volumes have turned positive, we expect core price to remain strong. With respect to volumes, we saw a positive volume growth in the first quarter but we did not chase low margin volumes by lowering price. We continue to drive disciplined growth by adding volumes in geographic areas and lines of business where growth is strongest.", "Our volumes reflect both the strong solid waste economic backdrop and great work by our sales and operating teams. Our traditional solid waste volumes were positive 2.4% in the first quarter of 2016, a 360 basis point improvement compared to 2015. We have one additional workday in 2016 and after adjusting for this, our traditional solid waste volumes improved 1.8%.", "We saw some very positive trends in our commercial and industrial lines of business. Our commercial volumes declined only 0.2% in the first quarter, an improvement of 50 basis points from the fourth quarter and a 260 basis point improvement from the first quarter of 2015. In the industrial line of business, volumes were more than doubled to 2.7% on a workday-adjusted basis when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.", "We're very pleased with our traditional solid waste volume results in the first quarter, although we likely did see some benefit from the milder winter weather that may have led to some second quarter construction and landfill volumes being pulled into the first quarter. We certainly expect volumes to remain positive throughout 2016, but we would like to see the extent of the seasonal uptick before we revisit our full year expectations for volumes.", "Our landfill line of business continues to show strong operational results as we saw the benefit of increased core price and strong volumes as Jim will discuss in more detail. However, we see a significant increase in the cost of managing the liquids that naturally occur in our landfills. Over the last three years, leachate costs have increased between 11% and 22%. And in the first quarter of 2016, the increase was greater than that with costs up about $14 million. This trend of increasing leachate costs has been ongoing for a number of years, and we believe it's a common issue throughout our industry.", "With the increase in volumes, we've seen more liquids, and the cost to transport and treat those liquids has increased substantially. Of course, the added cost at our landfills affects our profitability and return on capital so we need to do something to offset those increasing costs.", "Consequently, this quarter, we'll begin to implement a liquids management charge at our landfill. This charge will be between 4% and 7% of the cost of disposal and it will be applied only to our landfill customers and not to our collection customers. Of course, many of our disposal contracts are long term, but just as we did with our fuel recovery and recycling charges, we'll implement the liquids management charge on contracts as they renew. Only by doing this can we maintain an adequate return on the huge capital investments that we make in our landfills.", "Turning to recycling. We saw a drop of 12% in average commodity prices for the quarter and a 3.1% increase in volumes. The positive volumes are predominantly due to the unusually low broker volumes that we saw in the first quarter of 2015 associated with the slowdown in Western U.S. ports. This should normalize and will likely be negative in the second quarter, so we don't expect to see recycling volumes contributing to our overall volume growth. But the volumes that we're losing are generally not profitable volumes, so the negative volumes won't negatively affect profitability.", "Our employees have done a good job at managing operating costs as we've seen our recycling operating costs improve 12% when compared to the first quarter of 2015. However, the operational improvements have not been enough to offset the decline in commodity prices, so our recycling income from operations was slightly negative in the first quarter but we saw a year-over-year improvement of almost $0.02 per share. Commodity prices have come off the lows that we saw in January, but they're still below 2015 levels and we do not expect any significant rebound in 2016.", "So we continue to work with our customers to develop a mutually-beneficial solution that allows for a sustainable recycling program in their community. We're committed to recycling, and we'll continue to work to change the business model and drive out operating expenses.", "Finally, in the first quarter, our business generated strong growth in operating EBITDA, which in turn translated into significant cash generation. Cash flow from operating activities exceeded $700 million, an increase of more than $200 million when compared to the first quarter of 2015. We did have about $156 million in cash flow benefits in the quarter, which Jim will discuss. But even if you adjust for those, cash from operating activities grew by 10.2%.", "So 2016 is off to a strong start, and our results put us firmly on track to meet or exceed our full year guidance of adjusted earnings per diluted share between $2.74 and $2.79. We also expect to achieve or beat our full year free cash flow guidance of between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion. Based on first quarter volume results, we'd also expect to beat our volume goal for the year. I certainly believe that this will be the case, and we had favorable weather in the first quarter and we'd expect the volumes will pull it forward into the first quarter.", "As noted previously, we also had higher recycling volumes, which will not continue through the year. We'll get a better feel for the effects of these factors when we see our second quarter seasonal uptick. After we see volumes normalize, we expect to give more precise volume and financial guidance for the year. But we certainly expect to see continued year-over-year improvement across all of our operating metrics. It's a reflection of the strength of our corporate and field teams to see our strategy so well executed.", "I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our first quarter results in more detail.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, David. In the first quarter, revenues were $3.2 billion, an increase of $136 million or 4.5% when compared to the first quarter of 2015. We saw a $126 million increase in our traditional solid waste business due to the combined impacts of price and volume, and an $81 million increase in revenues from acquisitions net of divestitures. These increases were partially offset by declines of $32 million in lower fuel surcharge revenues, $18 million in foreign currency fluctuations and a $13 million decline from lower recycling revenues.", "Looking at internal revenue growth for the total company in the first quarter. Our collection and disposal core price was 5.3% and yield was 2.6% with total volumes improving 1.9%. We had one additional workday in the first quarter. Adjusting for the additional workday, volumes improved 1.3%. Volumes turned positive in the quarter for the first time since 2012. The combined positive price and positive volume led to total company income from operations growing $54 million, operating income margin expanding 110 basis points to 16%, operating EBITDA growing $74 million and operating EBITDA margin growing 130 basis points to 25.8%.", "Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefits of our disciplined pricing programs. Overall, collection core price was 6.5% and yield was 3.4%. Our strong core price reflects a disciplined approach to pricing and a strong demand for our services.", "In the first quarter, we continued to make progress on reducing the churn through our improved customer service. Our churn in the quarter was 9.2%, a 170 basis point improvement from the first quarter of 2015. The improvement in our churn, strong roll off demand, and our focus on disciplined growth benefited our volume trends in the first quarter as total collection volumes turned positive, improving 70 basis points sequentially from the fourth quarter and 240 basis points from the first quarter of 2015.", "Industrial demand was strong in the quarter with volumes up 4.2% or 2.7% on a workday adjusted basis. Our residential business continues to be a drag on volumes while commercial volumes are moving towards positive. For the quarter, residential volumes declined 3.4% and commercial volumes declined 0.2%, a year-over-year improvement of 260 basis points. Strong core price and positive volume in the collection line of business led to income from operations growing $21 million and operating EBITDA growing $36 million.", "In the landfill line of business, we also saw the benefits of positive volume and positive yield in the first quarter just as we did last year. Total landfill volumes increased 11.6% and 10.3% on a workday adjusted basis. On a workday adjusted basis, MSW volumes grew by 13.4%, C&D volume grew by 22.6%, and combined special waste and revenue generating cover volumes grew 2.9%.", "Our landfill volumes were stronger than we expected, in part due to milder weather and a couple of one-time events. We do not expect that the one-time events will repeat. So as we continue throughout the year, landfill volumes may moderate, but should remain solidly positive as we face increasingly tougher comparisons.", "We achieved core price of 3.3% and saw same-store average MSW rates increase year-over-year by 2.1% from Q1 of 2015. The positive volume and yield led to income from operations growing $29 million, margins growing 60 basis points, operating EBITDA increasing $40 million and operating EBITDA margins increasing 40 basis points.", "Moving now to operating expenses. As a percent of revenue, these expenses improved 120 basis points to 62.8%. For the first quarter, operating expenses increased $47 million when compared to the first quarter of 2015. Landfill operating costs increased the most at $17 million, an increase of more than 27% year-over-year. $14 million of the $17 million increase was leachate costs, which is one of the reasons that David mentioned the importance of imposing a charge to recover our increasing costs. The remainder of the operating cost increases primarily relate to our increased volumes and costs related to acquired operations.", "For the first quarter, as a percent of revenue, SG&A costs were 11.4%, flat when compared to the first quarter of 2015. On a dollar basis, SG&A costs were $362 million, an increase of $14 million compared to 2015. Labor costs drove the majority of the increase primarily related to acquisitions. We also had higher accruals for incentive compensation costs related to our strong performance. We still expect to improve SG&A costs as a percent of revenue for the full year when compared to 2015.", "Turning to cash flow for the first quarter, our operating EBITDA growth of almost 10% translated into strong cash flow growth. Cash provided by operating activities was $706 million, a $207 million increase compared to the first quarter of 2015. Included in the 2016 results was a $67 million benefit from the termination of a cross-currency hedge. We terminated the financial hedge because we borrowed money in Canadian dollars, thus providing a natural hedge against fluctuations in the Canadian dollar. The termination of the hedge had a negative $0.01 impact to EPS.", "In addition, favorably affecting our year-over-year comparisons were nearly $90 million from timing and size of compensation payments. Excluding those benefits, we had strong growth as cash provided by operating activities grew 10.2%. During the first quarter, we spent $317 million in capital expenditures, an increase of $84 million when compared to the first quarter of 2015. The increase was related to an intentional change in the timing of our truck purchases.", "However, as David mentioned, the cost of transporting our leachate has increased substantially so we are building some additional leachate treatment facilities. This will help with costs over the long run but will increase capital expenditures in 2016 and 2017. This makes it very important to implement our liquids recovery charge, so we can offset some of these capital costs and generate acceptable returns. Nevertheless, we still believe that we will be within our guidance range of between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion.", "In the first quarter, we also had $13 million in proceeds from divested assets. Combined, we generated $402 million of free cash flow, an increase of $117 million when compared to the first quarter of 2015. This puts us well on our way to achieving or exceeding our free cash flow guidance of between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion. In the first quarter, we returned $433 million to shareholders. We paid $183 million in dividends and we repurchased $250 million of shares.", "Finally, looking at our other financial metrics. At the end of the first quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, measured based on our bank covenants was 2.77%, and our weighted average cost to debt was 4.26%. The floating rate portion of our debt portfolio was 15% at the end of the quarter. The effective tax rate was approximately 35.4% in the first quarter. It was a bit higher than expected due to the timing of certain items, but we still believe that our full year tax rate will be 35%.", "In summary, the first quarter trends continue the momentum that built throughout 2015. We're well positioned to achieve or exceed our full year goals as our employees performed well to start the year. In the coming quarters, the year-over-year comparisons become tougher. But we have confidence that our employees can continue to meet or exceed our targets.", "And with that, Rebecca, let's open the line up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "And your first question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Credit Suisse.", "Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. If you could talk a little bit more about your volumes this quarter, obviously, there is some seasonal improvement. So I'm just trying to get a sense of what it's going to be like going forward, and what's the sustainable volume number into Q2, and what would this quarter then adjusting for what you said was recycling benefit, too.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. If you look at the volumes for the quarter, we think that about 30 basis points of the improvement was attributable to the recycling volumes which, as we said, won't repeat in the following quarters, but that's okay because they're not profitable volumes. And then about 20 to 30 basis points we estimate would be the amount that was pulled forward sort of from the second quarter. It's always a question when you have \u2013 whether it's good weather or bad weather in the first quarter, do volumes disappear when you have bad weather or do they just get pushed into the second quarter? And the same is true with good weather. Did volumes get pulled in from the second quarter to the first quarter, or is it just more economic activity so that there's going to be more volume?", "And so before we adjust our full year guidance, we wanted to be a little bit more precise on what the \u2013 we wanted to give a fairly tight range. And so waiting until the second quarter seasonal uptick, I think, will allow us to sort say, okay, here's a more normalized look at what the volumes are going to be. We fully expect those to be positive in the second quarter. The question is how positive will they be.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Andrew, I guess if you put those in dollar terms, last year one of the ways we looked at this was that last year's negative impact from weather was about $12.1 million in revenue and about $8.1 million EBIT. So I think it's fair to assume that we didn't have that weather impact this year. But as David said, it's hard to tell how much just moved from quarter to quarter and how much good weather actually expands volume or, on the other hand, bad weather contracts volume.", "Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. That's helpful. I guess, can you give us a sense of how April was trending then seasonally it probably still was strong like it's still trending...", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Basically, what we saw in April was that collection volumes sort of continue apace. The landfill volumes come down a little bit. We had some one-time \u2013 the MSW volumes come down, look, the MSW volumes were really strong in the first quarter but we had a couple of one-time type items. So for example, some of the waste energy plants along the East Coast were down for maintenance and so some of those volumes came over to us into our landfills. And so we'd expect the landfill volumes to moderate a little bit. But they'll still \u2013 they'll continue to be strong. So, I would say that, so far, the trends are pretty much what we expect in the second quarter. We continue to see positive volumes and we'd expect that to continue throughout May and June.", "Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "All right. Thanks, guys.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Volshteyn with JPMorgan.", "Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Looking at 2016, if you try to put it kind of all together, where do you see the main threats to your 2016 guidance? Where would it be coming from?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, to be quite honest with you, I don't see any threats to the guidance. I see some opportunities on the upside. But if there was going to be a threat, clearly recycling is still a little bit volatile. We haven't seen the rebound in commodity prices that you'd expect to see. Look, our core price is pretty much locked and loaded for the year. I mean, that is going to happen. Once we saw the \u2013 when you see these volumes turn positive and you see that our addition rate's exceeding our defection rate, it's hard to see volumes turning backwards.", "And so the things that are under our control, I think there's only upside, no downside. I guess, really, the only potential downside would be in a general economic downturn, what would happen to volumes. But I think if there is a general economic downturn, it's not going to be led by housing like the last one was. And so we should see, at least, a six- to nine-month lag in any reduction in volumes. And so it's hard to see how 2016 can do anything other than meet or exceed our guidance.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Dave, I might add the issue of the economy itself. We still see positive container weights in the quarter. We have the last couple of quarters and our service increases are exceeding decreases six or eight quarters in a row. So that's pretty good economics on what's happening in North America.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, Jeff. One of the common questions that we get is about the strength of the industrial sector and we best measure that by looking at our special waste pipeline. When you look at special waste for the first quarter, it really didn't show a whole lot of impact from weather because in the month of January, we were actually down year-over-year about 4.5%.", "We were up about 1% in February, so pretty close to flat. And then March, we were up 6.1%. And when you look at April, April looks like it's up probably double March. So when you ask about the risk to EBITDA, one of the areas that is somewhat \u2013 it does fluctuate some is that special waste pipeline and it looks pretty encouraging right now.", "Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "That's very helpful. And if I can ask one more, just if you could give a little more color on the geographies and how does performance change in various regions where you operate?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. It is interesting to see that after the last economic downturn, you saw the trends completely switch from being Sun Belt driven to being more Rust Belt driven. And what we've seen over the last six to nine months, as you've seen it sort of revert back to what I would call a pre-recession economy where housing starts in Florida and throughout the Gulf Coast and then all the way into California are driving very strong results throughout the sunbelt. And you've seen the Sun Belt actually performing better than the Rust Belts.", "It's why we like having a diversified business. It works in any kind of economy. Obviously, right now, you're seeing the South do better than the North. But the North continues to drive improved profitability, it just happens to be a little bit stronger in the South. So from a geography point of view, I think you can sort of follow the housing trends and say that our business is following that, which is very strong from Florida through the Gulf Coast then into California. And then continued strength, but not as strong throughout the Midwest and East Coast.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "I would echo what the Waste Connections guys said this morning which is pretty strong growth universally across the country and in Canada as well, except where you have kind of big E&P operations, and those are weak. And so those areas of the country have been a little bit depressed, but the rest of the U.S. and Canada looks pretty strong.", "Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "This is very helpful color. And one last maintenance question from me is just on CapEx. So your total number for CapEx remains the same, you have a little bit of an increase for leachate investments where \u2013 and then you've have more truck investment. What is being reduced as far as capital investment?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We're not really reducing anything. We're actually increasing the number of trucks. It just moves us within the range, right? The range is $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion and what we're spending on leachate treatment facilities is well less than the amount of the range. So we are not cutting back on capital for Yellow Iron, on capital for containers and capital for trucks we're actually increasing that from last year. So it really just moves us a little bit up in the range.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. We're probably going to be \u2013 you remember last year, we're $1.23 billion in CapEx. We gave the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion range. This year, we're probably going to be in the middle of that, maybe towards the higher end of it. Exactly what David said which is about 125 extra trucks, about $25 million additional capital invested in our Yellow Iron fleet which is, in some cases, has got some older equipment. And then putting in some wastewater treatment facilities, which we'll have the pay back to them but they have a big upfront capital cost.", "Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thank you very much. This is very helpful.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Absolutely.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman from Stifel.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Jim, Jim, how are you today?", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "(30:04).", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I'm doing fine, too, Michael.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Good. I asked. On the MSW, when you talk about that type of a volume number in the landfill, one could go that's eye-popping. Well, (30:19) 2% GDP. So Jim Trevathan, you made a comment earlier that container weights \u2013 on a same-store basis, what's your container weight trend been in your commercial business?", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "It's been positive the last couple of quarters, Michael.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "In the 2%, 3% type zone?", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "A little below that. 1.5%, in that kind of range.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. So, that's more reflective of underlying consumerism GDP, and that's how we should think about this is good but shouldn't get irrationally exuberant about 13% MSW in one quarter?", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Agree. Absolutely agree. Michael, we also had \u2013 Dave mentioned the waste energy plants. We also had a couple of competitor landfills close during the quarter or during the \u2013 really, the second half of last year. And we've picked up a good portion, if not all of that volume at one of them. And that's helping that 12%, 13% MSW volume growth. That'll continue but some of the one-timers that David and Jim mentioned will not continue.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, Michael, at the peak, we did roughly 130 million tons into the landfill. Now we're probably looking closer to 110 million tons into the landfill. And so the strong MSW volumes, to me, are indicative that finally we're getting back to where \u2013 as in an industry, we're getting back to where we were pre-recession. Most other businesses are already above the volume levels that they were pre-recession. And so I don't see that moderating. I think that's just a reversion back to the norm.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And when do you think that leveling-off point occurs as you look at sort of the economic drivers that drive your business?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Gosh, it's hard to see \u2013 again, we're still 20 million tons below where we were at peak. You're seeing a lot of municipalities take some types of materials out of their recycling streams. And so when I look at the future, I think there's more upside potential on the volume than there is downside potential.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And a couple of years before you get that incremental 20 million?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Well maybe if you look at the pace of change between today and the great recession, yeah. I would think \u2013 I think it's you'd still see a couple years. And that's a couple of years of good solid, sort of 4% to 7% type volume growth at the MSW line.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. That's what I was trying to get at. And then this liquid management charge, if you took the 3.3% landfill pricing in 1Q and you had had that surcharge in the whole quarter, what would this 3.3% look like?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Well, look, it's going to be slow to see any big results out of that. Look, the point here is that we've got to recover our landfill operating costs. The part of the problem is that a lot of those contracts are long term. And we're going to go out and start doing it in some test markets in the first quarter. we're not going to just go out and do it blanket across the country just to find out what does the reception look like. If we go out and do a 7% charge across the entire country, you're putting a lot of volumes at risk.", "And so we're going to go into a couple key markets and we're going to test it and see what the reaction is in the market. I think the whole industry is having the same problem. And so, I would expect the charge to be well received in the market. But we're going to test it this quarter and then we'll roll it out during the course of the year.", "But even at its peak, we don't think it's any more than $10 million to $15 million over the next couple of years, and that's on an annual basis just because we have so many contracts that are long term. But if we can get an additional $10 million to $15 million that at least goes a little bit of the way to cover in the increased leachate costs.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And is some of this leachate \u2013 you've had a very wet year, first quarter in the middle of the country where you have a lot of landfills.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And so, basically what you got going on here, Michael, is two different things. Look, we had 11% additional volume going in there. So you've got naturally-occurring water from the volumes. And we've had positive volumes now for quite a few years so you get more liquid out of that. And then as you say, we've had more rain events.", "And so there's been a lot more fluid. But the bigger part of it, frankly, is that the cost to transport and dispose of the liquids has gone up fairly dramatically. And so we sort of had a double whammy, more liquids and higher cost to dispose.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. I mean, that's the bigger concern is the last part of David's statement. When you look at some areas of the country, the unit cost of disposal of leachate has gone up 400% to 500%. So that's why we're talking about this charge. It's not related necessarily to the rain because \u2013 look, we could have a dry year at some point, too.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Fair enough. And then, Jim Fish, on the cash flow from ops, it was 22% of revenues which is well above your long average. How do I think about what cash flow for ops should be for the full year as a percent of sales given the adjustments you talked about?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Boy, on a percent of sales. And I don't normally look at it that way, but I think it'll moderate a bit because the primary driver of that is EBITDA. And while we thought EBITDA was fantastic, as David said in his opening comments, we need to see what EBITDA does or all of our financial metrics do when we transition from this pretty mild winter quarter into spring and summer.", "With that said \u2013 and even \u2013 honestly, Michael, when we look at this on an EPS basis, we were up $0.09 versus prior year. Historically, we've been up kind of $0.02 to $0.03 over the last five years, $0.02 to $0.03 per quarter. So $0.09 felt like a great quarter but also felt like we don't want to straight line that. So when I think of cash from operations I think we're going to wait, reserve comment until we see how that transition from the mild winter first quarter into the spring quarter, how it looks.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Churn is at 9.2%. Is that about the floor?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I mean, that's right about the lowest we've ever had.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. So, the good news is is your replacement costs have come down meaningfully because you've reduced the churn, so that's helped in the overall pricing as well and that anniversaries. So I got 2Q and 3Q, and then it anniversaries in the fourth quarter because you're around 9% in the fourth quarter.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Right. That's right...", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then, Jim \u2013 sorry. Go ahead, David.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. We were at what, 9.2% in the fourth quarter?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "We were almost identical.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yeah. Okay.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, I'll tell you, Michael, we've touched 12% over the last couple of years and most of those numbers have been double digit. Those two quarters are the lowest in over a decade. So this is substantial for us in the process of retention, and we're making real headway in that regard.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Well, yeah. Yeah. I get it. Because it significantly lowers the pressure on your pricing reported \u2013 yield because to replace that customer's much lower price than what you lost. So...", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And the important thing, Michael, is that the addition rate was 9.6%. And so you can see the rollover effect of that positive addition rate. We always follow the rule of 72 here and you can sort of see it as it creates that sort of annuity policy for us. That addition rate just continues to roll and roll and roll throughout the quarters. And so that's why we say it's hard to see our volumes going negative again because we've got that addition rate above the defection rate.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Michael, as you know, that addition rate and defection rate are based on number of customers. We're net positive in dollars as well and have been now for the third consecutive quarter. So that roll-forward effect will continue. Again, numbers matter. Number of new customers, but dollars are the ultimate measure.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And Michael, one last point on your question about cash from operations. When you say 22% of revenue, that includes the $67 million benefits to cash from operations from the termination of the SWAB. It includes the one last cash pay period that we had. We had a pay period that fell on January 1 this year, so we actually had \u2013 we paid it out on December 31, 2015. So we actually had one more cash pay period in 2015 and one less in 2016. So that 22%, even if we take out any effect of kind of a mild winter quarter, you still have a few things in that 22% that don't repeat.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yeah. That was my question. I'm assuming the 22% benefited by the nonrecurrings, but your long-term average has been 17%. It appears you're trending better than your average even for the adjustment. So that's what I was trying to get at.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, yeah, I didn't do a good job of answering that, but that's \u2013 I think you're right. We feel good about the trend. We're not looking at a 22% trend because of the one-timers.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Right. And which leads to \u2013 I get you're not raising guidance, but if you take the midpoint of your capital spending and your trend works up by a percentage point on cash flow from ops, we're beating free cash flow guidance, too.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. No, look, I mean I think what we'd say is that we want to wait for the second quarter to understand the seasonal upticks. But if there's going to be an adjustment, it's certainly going to be an adjustment upward.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Right. And then last one from me, Jim Fish, you had led this year with the objective to have a flat dollars of SG&A, is that still the intention given some of the strength in the business?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, look, our goal is to stay as close to flat as possible. But keep in mind, we added $90 million, $92 million in acquisitions, which came with some SG&A, primarily S right? A lot of the G&A has come out of those, but the S stays and that's a good thing for us. And similarly, the other half of our increase in dollars in SG&A was incentive compensation related to strong performance, so I look at that as being a good thing as well.", "One thing I would say is, in addition to saying that we will try to get as close to flat as we can is that on a percent of revenue basis, one kind of aspirational number we've had out there for probably a decade has been 10% on an annual basis. We were at 10.4% last year. I think we have a decent chance of getting to or below 10% for the year. So we'll shoot for flat, may not get there but I think we're getting pretty close to 10% for the year on a percent of revenue basis.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks for answering my questions.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Absolutely.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk of Wedbush Securities.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Morning, everybody.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Morning, Al.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Just wanted a couple of housekeeping items. For 2016, how much acquisition revenue is included in your expectations?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. When we looked at the beginning of the year, we thought we'd do $100 million, $200 million of tuck-ins. I would say that we're probably on pace for the lower end of that right now. And then obviously, we sort of used a mid-year convention for that. And then, of course, we got the SWS revenue. So we had, what, I'm sorry, $90-some-odd million become...", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "$92 million and then (42:49)", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Exactly. $92 million and then you'd take the divestures out. But I would guess that that $90 million run rate is probably good for the year.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "It might be a little high just because we anniversary Deffenbaugh. So, what you're going to get is a full year of SWS, a full year of EnviroServ which is a little smaller out west.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "But then you replaced that with the small tuck-ins, right?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "We replaced that, yeah.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So it could be. It kind of depends on how those tuck-ins go throughout the year.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Okay. It's a good point. Deffenbaugh's anniversaried already, or is there a couple...", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Al, well, yes. It's anniversaried at the very end of Q1.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Okay.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "With a full first quarter of kind of gain, if you will, in Deffenbaugh, but then nothing in the second quarter. It's all kind of integrated in an anniversary.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Okay. In constructive light, if you don't mind, may I ask this question? Understanding that the volume was strong and there were couple of the extra work pay, one other things that just escaped my mind. But the messaging, David, around volumes seems to be a little misplaced and I said \u2013 and taking this in the light of what I'm intending it. You've been pushing for getting to flat. It now seems you're going to be substantially above that flat level, yet we all know that the underlying business doesn't really change all that much. So for lack of a better word, what did we miss on looking at the business or directionally? Where were you a little too conservative on the trend there for volumes?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Look, I would say the underlying business actually has changed fairly dramatically. I mean, you see it not only in our numbers but you see it in everybody's numbers. The roll off volumes right now have been nothing short of spectacular. And our roll off volumes doubled quarter to quarter, and that's with the energy services being down. And so roll-offs bench really strong. C&D has been very strong. MSW has been very strong. Special waste has continued to be nicely positive.", "And then on the commercial side, I think you're seeing sort of a cumulative effect of the new business in new commercial construction that we've seen over the last few years. So I really think the underlying trends in our business are as positive as they have been since 2007.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. Finally, if I just may pick a little bit on the SG&A, Jim Fish. I saw some recent head count reduction announced. I think there was more for outsourcing. What other benefits are there in terms of trying with the goal of keeping the dollar level flattish that was just asked previously?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. First, let me correct one thing, what you saw was probably in Phoenix, and we moved \u2013 by the way, the difference between outsourcing and offshoring there/ They're still employees, we just have now employees at our own host office, back office indoor in India. So they're still considered employees, and are still carried under our payroll as opposed to true outsourcing there.", "But really, the big drivers of SG&A dollar increase, as I said to Michael, were acquisition related which we think is a good thing. We will make sure that we try and take as much of the kind of duplicate SG&A out of these acquisitions, as we always do. But the sales component is very important. I mean, if you think about Deffenbaugh, it was an area that we had no operations. If you think about EnviroServ, it's an area where we had operations but they had a niche business. So, the sales component of SG&A will stay on and is very important to us in terms of growing top line dollars. And of course, the other piece is just a true-up of incentive compensation plans.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hey Al, if the concern is just the creep into our SG&A, we \u2013 Jim and I both and Dave are still on track. We look at all of increases or even replacements and make sure that the absolute right thing to do and there are very few of those on the sales side even, although, Jim is right, we retain the Deffenbaugh additions. We have added some sales heads in early 2015 but fewer in 2016. And we look at those on a return basis. Are they generating the value or we don't do them.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I would tell you, nobody is more cognizant of the danger of SG&A creep. When things look good on all other financial metrics, the one that can get away from SG&A. So as Jim said, we are scrutinizing every single not only head count addition but even replacements to make sure that we're only adding where we need to add and where it adds top line or bottom line.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Excellent. Great. Appreciate it. Thanks. Good luck.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Corey Greendale with First Analysis.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Just a couple from me. First of all, so the pricing \u2013 the core price in industrial has been strong, got even stronger. Is that reflective of what you're seeing in temporary roll off or is that being driven more by permanent work?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That's temporary roll off. We had a roll off season that started very early. We had unseasonably warm construction season. And virtually, across the board we heard from our folks out in the field that they're not able to \u2013 they don't have the trucks and the containers to meet the demand. So what do you do when you don't have capacity to meet demand? You add more trucks and drivers and you raise your price, and that's basically what we saw. And not only do you raise your price, but all of a sudden, those cans that are only being pulled once a month, you take them back and you put them out into another customer where they're pulled more often. And so we saw an unusually strong roll off season. And again, that's continued through April.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "So, on \u2013 sorry.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "I was going to say, if I can add to that, that doesn't diminish the increases that we're getting on the permanent business as well. It just says most of that came from the answer that Dave gave you.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Yeah. So the data suggests that the market is absorbing it well with the low churn. If you had told me two years ago that you're going to get 10% core price in industrial, I would have said you're going to shock the market by doing that. So it sounds like that's not happening. Is there any time that that could be starting? Or is it that there's so much demand and you've got the capacity by virtue of being Waste Management, and some of the smaller local providers just don't have capacity so you're able to do that now, but maybe more capacity comes in over time?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That's exactly right. I mean, I think you hit the nail right in the head. There is limited roll off capacity and it got stretched in the construction season. Not everywhere, it's regional. And so we haven't seen that slow down. And again, it's not just raising prices. It's making sure that you're getting the most efficient use out of that container and that driver and I think we've done a pretty good job of that out in the field of making sure that we're getting the maximum number of polls out of our can.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And it all sounds, Corey, like, when you talk about a 10% increase as if there's concern that we lose permanent roll off business and that's why David pointed out. But this is largely a microeconomic application of pricing to the temp roll off business as a function of strong, strong demand in certain geographies.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "I understand. And then I understand that the leachate related charge you're talking about, not a big dollar amount. But can you remind me, have you done other kind of specific cost offsetting fees at landfills or have you only done that on the collection side before?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We've applied the environment charge at the landfill. Certainly not as much across the board as we have on the collection line of business. And that's why this one's going to be landfill focused. I mean, it really is a landfill particular problem. The environmental charge, when you look at our cost for environmental compliance that stretches across all aspects of our business. This is peculiar to the landfill.", "Again, I think if you look at everybody in the industry, you'd see both industry players and private players. You'd see that their leachate costs are going up. I mean, it's just a function of higher volumes and higher transportation cost. And so I think the industry has two choices, right? You either watch that return on capital shrink at the landfills, which it has been doing over the last few years or you do something to reverse it. We've decided to do this liquids management charge. I can't speak for anyone else, but that's the way we're going to drive that return on capital. Because look, we invest more capital on the landfill than any other single asset that we have. Now we've got to get the return on it.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Yeah, I understand. And I realized kind of market conditions change so maybe not a good analog. Where I was going with that, I was wondering if you could make a drawn analogy what the reaction was when you implemented the environmental charge at the landfills. Have you found competitors kind of following along or if they use that as an opportunity to try to take volume from you?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No. I mean, I would say for the most part \u2013 again, the environmental charge is not widespread on our landfill customers. But for the most part, we've seen the market react quite favorably.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "And then just one last quick one, you already addressed the line question a bunch of different ways, but when you reported last quarter, you said that you thought volume gets stronger in the back half of the year. Do you still think that is likely to be the case?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Well the couple of headwinds that we have going into back half of the year are the recycling volumes, right? And that was about a 30 basis point benefit in the first quarter. But if those volumes go negative like we expect them to go in the back half of the year, it's probably a little bit more of an effect because it will go from positive 3.1% to negative 2% in the back half of the year. So it could be a little bit more than 30 to 40 basis points. But the underlying macroeconomic trends that we see in the industrial and the commercial line are strong.", "And so I would expect \u2013 look, we've always said we don't look at volumes for volumes' sake. We look at volumes to try to add profitable volumes. And what I would say is that the trend line on the profitable volumes that we're going to add is going to be very positive throughout the rest of the year. Some of those negative volumes like landfills, maybe some residential contracts, some of those things might moderate the volume growth a little bit but I expect that we'll continue to see good strong growth in the landfill line and the industrial line and the commercial line.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Got it. Thank you and congratulations on the good start to the year.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Good morning, guys.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hey, Tyler.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey, quick housekeeping item. So Jim Fish, I may have missed it but can you go over the day adjusted collection volumes by line?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Let me see here. Flip back into the script for a second.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Yeah. Sorry about that.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Okay. So, roll off volume was 4.2%, on a day adjusted basis it was 2.7%.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I didn't give a day adjusted commercial...", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "It's the same negative point 2%.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Right.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Okay. So roughly maybe the same impact on each, okay. I do want to dig in a little... sorry.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "There was no impact on the commercial line.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Oh, no impact? Okay. Okay. Perfect. All right. And then I do want to dig in a little bit more on the landfill volume. So if you look at your actual tons consumed, the $23.6 million versus $20.9 million that actually went in to the landfill. That was a great number, probably the best physical number we've seen in some time. You noted a number of the one-time drivers. But can you isolate maybe how much the burner availability was in issue? And was coal ash a driver in that?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, yes, to both. The coal ash was a driver. By the way, one last point on your first question. Landfill volume on a day adjusted basis was 10.3%, the unadjusted was 11.6%.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So to answer your second question, coal ash was certainly a piece of it because we saw some scheduled maintenance done at Covanta and at Wheelabrator that did impact us. We also saw that the coal business, that Duke Energy contract we've talked a lot about, started to really kind of ramp up. We have three plants and all three of those are kind of fully up and running, and that was growing incrementally throughout 2015. But, I would tell you that those \u2013 I don't know, Jim, if you know the number for the coal ash piece.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "No. I don't.. But it was improved year-over-year.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Certainly improved.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "It was part of that...", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "But that's a long-term issue, Tyler. We have that business in 2016 and we'll continue those projects. So that's not part of the one-time.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then, David, this is a bigger picture question. You kind of touched on it. But the MSW landfill volumes are very robust. We saw it with you, we saw it with Connections, et cetera. The industry seems to be shuttering, recycling capacity across the board. And do you think that the woes on the recycling side with some of that material, is it making its way back into the landfill? And do you think that's part of the whole MSW volume story?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I don't think there's any doubt. I mean, when you see recycling rates going backwards over the last couple years, that material has to have an outlet. And I do think that some of that material is going clearly to the landfill.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Yeah, very helpful. And then just last one, Jim Trevathan, what did hazardous waste landfill volumes do in the quarter?", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "They were improved year-over-year. We had a pretty good year-over-year improvement at the two Southern sites that had a event business given good weather that was larger than the prior years, event business. Especially at the Alabama site.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And then in our California hazardous site, we actually did an acquisition, our EnviroServ acquisition out there. And so we saw pretty good volume growth there too.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "And we'll continue to see that as we move some of that volume that's still going third-party as we get state approvals to bring them into Kettleman. That volume from that acquisition, will improve here, during the course of this year.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Right. Didn't Kettleman just restart up? Is that right?", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. In the second half of the last year. They were running but they had a very low rate in the first year (59:05).", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Yeah. Okay. All right, thank you, guys.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Box from KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, guys.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Morning.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "So with cash flow expected to be above the range and leverage up some but still below the 3 times kind of mark that you're looking for, can you maybe just gives an update on the buyback and maybe should we think about another ASR at some point, either this year or on the horizon?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. We said at the beginning of the year that we'd spend $600 million on the share buyback and I would expect that we would at least hit that number. We've talked about \u2013 we did $250 million in the first quarter, we've talked about doing another $250 million ASR this quarter. And so we'll certainly spend the $600 million. I think there's probably a little bit of upside to that number as we see the cash generation through the year.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Got it. Thanks for that. And...", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "There's a couple things there on the leverage ratio and then capital allocation. The leverage ratio finished at 2.77, up a bit from the end of Q4 largely related to the acquisition of SWS. But we think for the year, we'll probably be in that 2.6 to 2.7 range. Long term we probably expand that range a bit and kind of call it 2.5 to 3.0 just to give us some opportunity there if we see a big acquisition that looks like it's strategic and reasonably priced, we may go after that. Unfortunately, at this point we don't see any of those out there. So we'll just go \u2013 when we think about capital allocation, we'll go with kind of the $100 million to $200 million in acquisitions. And then we'll maintain that leverage ratio, long term in that 2.5 to 3 range.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Got it. Thanks for that, Jim. And then one last quick one. So I want to flesh out the volume growth a little bit. You're still seeing resi volumes decline. Can you maybe just talk to the undercurrents that you're seeing within volume and maybe the impact on margin? Because obviously a solid incremental EBITDA margin this quarter. Is there may be a double benefit with the volume? You're getting a positive mix and then you're also getting more volume at the landfill. Just any color there would be helpful.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I think it's exactly right. When you look at the lines of business from a margin perspective going from top to bottom, you go landfill, commercial, industrial, residential, right? And when you see the predominant volumes coming into those \u2013 to the landfill and into the industrial side, and you saw 360 basis points of improvement on the commercial side. It's like I said, we don't go after volumes for volumes' sake. We try to go after the volumes that actually make money. So if we lose a little bit of volumes on recycling, lose a little bit of volumes on residential, I'm not going to tell you that we like that because they do generate some EBITDA, but when you look at it from a mix point of view and from a profitability point of view, I'd much rather be adding volumes on the commercial, industrial, landfill line than on residential and recycling.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Maybe one more point, Dave, is that on the resi side, when you renew a contract or you gain a contract, it's generally a capital outlay. So we look at return on that invested capital stronger there. Because the other lines of business are inherently strong on an ROI basis.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Got it. Thanks for the color, guys. I appreciate it.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your question comes from the line Hamzah Mazari with Sterne Agee.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hi. This is (01:02:51). I'm filling in for Hamzah. Had a question about the Canadian portion of your business. With the Waste Connections and Progressive Waste merger closing soon, can you give us a sense of your position in the Canadian marketplace? And maybe do an M&A there on the U.S. side, how that all relates?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. When we look at the Progressive deal, obviously, we couldn't do that because we have too much business in Canada. Certainly, I think Waste Connections, taking over that business is a very positive thing for the industry. Progressive, I would say, was a little bit more of an aggressive volume player than Waste Connections is. So I think it's only going to be positive for all the business in Canada.", "From our perspective, we did a large transaction in Montreal couple years ago. I think, I'd say about Canada exactly what Jim said about the United States. If we could find a good sized acquisition that's strategic for us and that's priced fairly, we'd go out and do it. But I think the same thing applies to Canada as does the United States. Right now, we just don't see those. A lot of the sort of what I'd call mid-sized acquisitions, call it in the sort of $500 million to $2 billion type, dollar range. A lot of those type of sellers right now expect too high a price for their business. And so, we have to pass on them for now. But I see that business certainly not being hurt by the fact that Waste Connections will be our new Canadian neighbor instead of Progressive.", "Unknown Speaker", "All right. Great. Appreciate it. Thanks a lot.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Michael Feniger with Bank of America.", "Michael J. Feniger - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.", "Thanks, guys, for taking my call. I think last quarter you mentioned a 30 to 40 bps benefit margin on lower fuel. Did you guys break that out this quarter? Where did you see the tailwind on the margin line from the lower fuel price?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. The fuel impact was, to be exact here, 13 basis points tailwind for us. When you think about fuel, we had about $32 million lower in fuel surcharge revenues, $33 million in fuel expense, so kind of a push there. And then when you factor in the lower fuel surcharges that we pay to third-party transportation providers, that's where you get the 13 bps of tailwind.", "Michael J. Feniger - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.", "Great. And the incremental margin was I think around 50% this quarter, a little over that. I mean, is that \u2013 when we think about this going into this environment where it's kind of looking like the best environment we've seen since 2007, is that 50% incremental margin, is that a sustainable run rate we should be thinking in a market where you're getting really good pricing and starting to see positive volumes?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Look, I think in a positive volume environment and particularly when the volumes are positive in the landfill and in the commercial industrial line, I don't think that 40% to 50% flow through is an unreasonable number.", "Michael J. Feniger - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Scott Levine with Imperial Capital.", "Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "Hey, guys.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning, Scott.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "Just one question, really. Your core price of 5.3%, just looking at your last transcript. You guys were guiding for 4% this year. Obviously, this is a huge upside to that number. Just wondering whether informally your expectations for this year would be considerably higher or maybe a little bit more color on the upside in price in the quarter.", "And then I have a follow-up about CPI which has always been strengthening a bit of late and wondering if you could remind us of your exposure to index-based pricing and/or whether we might see some lift associated with that if inflation continues to pick up.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. When you look at CPI on a core basis, you certainly see an improvement. But when you look on it on a universal basis, you've actually seen it flat to down because of lower energy prices. So we still think that in the back half of the year, CPI, which is about 40% of our business, CPI could be a headwind not a tailwind in the back half of the year.", "With respect to core price, we pushed up a lot of our price increases this year, and we're going to be anniversarying some mid-year type price increases we did last year. And so I don't expect the dollars to moderate during the course of the year, but I would expect that the actual number at core price and the number on yield would probably moderate a little bit. But we still wholly expect to be above that 4% core price, and at or above that 2% yield.", "Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "Great. Thanks, David.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Barbara Noverini with Morningstar.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Good morning, everyone.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hey, Barbara.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Just a quick clarification question. So once your leachate treatment facilities are built, we're basically looking to see operational cost savings from replacing higher or third-party cost with your own labor. So is this a longer term goal and that you want most of you major landfills that's common in wetter areas to be self-reliant when it comes to leachate treatment versus basically just targeting specific facilities where this has been a particular challenge?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, so...", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I think it's the latter.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "When you look at it, it's really geographies. I mean, the biggest expense we'll have this year is a geography where you have a water treatment facility at POTW that in the past has always taken leachate, not only from us but from a lot of other third party landfills around the area and they decided not to take leachate anymore. And so that's when Jim talks about cost going up by 500%, that's basically what happened and this geography. Our outlet for disposal basically disappeared, so now we have to find another outlet and it happens to be a lot further away.", "So in that type of case \u2013 and this is a fairly rural area in the Southeast, and so in most cases, if one POTW shuts you down, doesn't take leachate anymore, you can find another POTW. This happens to be in a more remote type area so you have to build your own treatment facility, but that's pretty unique to this geography.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Got it. Got it. And then out of curiosity, could you then open your own treatment facility to accept third-party leachate volumes?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We could if we wanted. I think it'll be fully utilized with our own capacity but we could if we wanted to. And then I think I'd just add a little bit to what David said. We don't expect to build these things across the country, across U.S. and Canada. We don't want in Eastern Pennsylvania, the one that he mentioned is in kind of the mid-Atlantic area, and we don't have any other plans to build them beyond those unless we see similar cost increases. But that is the concern and that's why we're proposing the charge here.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Yeah. Makes sense. Okay. Thanks a lot.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "I might \u2013 one clarification. We can but we would have to get a permit from the state that would allow us to accept third-party materials rather than just our own. The current permit does not allow that. So it's possible, it's just not part of the current plan.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think it's moot because we're going to have (01:10:52)", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. We'll fill it up.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "You've got enough to keep your attention, I understand. Thanks a lot.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And thank you.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no further questions.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "All right. Thank you, all. Obviously, we're off to a very strong start. We look forward to seeing the seasonal uptick in the second quarter and getting back to you with a more precise view of the full year at the end of the second quarter. But I would be remiss to say that when we get to report these good quarters, we as a senior team get to report the numbers. We still realize who produces the numbers, and that's our folks here at the corporate staff and our folks out in the field that are doing a spectacular job applying our strategies throughout the country. We will see you on the road, and we'll see you in the next quarter. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you for participating. This does conclude today's conference call.

The combined revenue growth and cost improvement led to strong growth in operating EBITDA to $955 million, an increase of almost 9% and an improvement in our operating EBITDA margin of a 140 basis points to 27.9%. This is the highest operating EBITDA margin that we've achieved in seven years. Our pricing programs continued to drive earnings growth in margin expansion. For the second quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.9% and yield was 2.6%. Core price improved 80 basis points from the second quarter of 2015 and yield was up 90 basis points. Core price in the industrial line was 9.5%, in the commercial line it was 7.6%, in our landfill line it was 2.7% and in our residential line it was 2.5%.", "Importantly, in the second quarter, our churn was 9.1%, a 120 basis points better than the last year and 10 basis points better than the first quarter of 2016, which demonstrates our ability to retain pricing and retain customers through improvements in our service efforts.", "At this point, we would certainly expect to exceed our full year core price target of 4% and our 2% yield target, although, both metrics could moderate somewhat in the back half of the year due to year-over-year comparisons. With respect to volumes, we saw positive volume growth in the second quarter just as we did in the first quarter.", "But most encouraging is that we saw volume growth in the right volumes, our high margin commercial, industrial and landfill lines. In fact, our commercial volumes turned positive for the first time in over a decade. We shed volumes in the lower margin residential and recycling lines of business as we continue to eliminate low or negative margin contracts.", "Our traditional solid waste volumes were positive 0.8% in the second quarter of 2016, a 140 basis point improvement from the second quarter of 2015. Our commercial volumes were 0.3% in the second quarter, an improvement of 50 basis points in the first quarter and a 250 basis point improvement from Q2 of 2015.", "As this is our highest margin collection segment, this is a significant accomplishment and is reflected in the income from operations of the commercial line of business where we achieved the highest results ever.", "We expect to see continued growth in our commercial line as the year progresses, which is attribute to the efforts of our sales and marketing teams. So, our strategy of maintaining price discipline while adding the right volumes continued to bear fruit. We did see slightly stronger volume growth in the first quarter with weather in the first quarter of 2016 much milder than in the first quarter of 2015. So, we weren't surprised to see a little less volume growth in the second quarter versus the first, but we expect total company volumes to continue to improve throughout the remainder of the year and we now expect our traditional solid waste volumes to exceed 1% positive by year end.", "Residential and recycling volumes were down on the quarter and we'd expect them to be down for the remainder of the year, but the loss of those volumes is mostly intentional, given that their low margin or often times even negative margin volumes.", "Our landfill line of business continues to show strong results, which Jim will discuss in more detail. However, as we mentioned on the first quarter conference call, we've seen a significant increase in the cost of managing the liquids that naturally occur in our landfills. In the second quarter of 2016, the increase in leachate cost was about $22 million or $0.03 per share.", "As of July 1, we've implemented a wastewater management charge at all of our landfills for customers that are not under contract. We're still in the early stages, but so far, there has not been significant pushback. The next step will be to apply the charge to our disposal contracts as they renew. By passing these cost increases on to our customers, we'll ensure that we maintain an adequate return on the huge capital investments that we make in our landfills.", "Turning to recycling, we saw a 2.3% increase in average commodity prices for the quarter and a 2.9% decrease in volumes. We continue to focus on managing operating cost as we've seen our recycling operating cost improved more than 9% when compared to the second quarter of 2015. These operational improvements and the increase in commodity prices drove the recycling line of business to its highest income from operations since 2012. When the blended commodity prices were a $109 per ton versus $85 in the second quarter of 2016.", "Year-over-year, the recycling line of business contributed $0.01 per share to earnings. We continue to work with our customers to develop a mutually beneficial solution that allows for a sustainable recycling business model.", "To summarize, the positive momentum that we saw in the first quarter continued throughout the second quarter. All of our employees worked hard to deliver strong first half results by focusing on improving price, driving disciplined volume growth and managing costs.", "In light of a strong first half performance, we're increasing our adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance to between $2.83 and $2.86 for the full year. A $0.09 to $0.12 increase from the low end of our previous guidance.", "More importantly, we're also raising our free cash flow guidance for 2016 to between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion, a $100 million to $200 million increase in the low end of our previous guidance, despite our expected capital expenditures being slightly higher than our previous guidance. So the momentum in our business continues. And our focus has never been sharper.", "We look forward to our corporate and field teams building upon this strong performance to drive even better results for the remainder of 2016 and beyond.", "I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our second quarter results in more detail.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, David. In the second quarter revenues were $3.43 billion, an increase of a $110 million or 3.3% when compared to the second quarter of 2015. We saw a $150 million increase in our traditional solid waste business due to a $98 million increase from the combined impacts of price and volume and a $52 million increase in revenues from acquisitions net of divestitures.", "These increases were partially offset by declines of $24 million in lower fuel surcharge revenues, $10 million in foreign currency fluctuations and a $5 million decline from lower recycling revenues. Looking at internal revenue growth for the company in the second quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.9% and yield was 2.6% with total volumes improving 0.4%.", "Volumes were positive for the second consecutive quarter. The combined positive price and positive volume, led to total company income from operations growing $58 million, operating income margin expanding 120 basis points to 18%, operating EBITDA growing $76 million and operating EBITDA margin growing 140 basis points to 27.9%.", "Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefits of our disciplined pricing programs and improved volumes. Overall, collection core price was 6.3% and yield was 3.3%. Industrial demand continued the strong performance that we saw in the first quarter. Volume was up 1.5% in the second quarter, a 150-basis point improvement from the second quarter of 2015.", "And as David mentioned, commercial volumes were positive for the first time since 2005 at 0.3% for the second quarter, a 250 basis point improvement from the second quarter of 2015. Our residential business continues to be a drag on overall collection volumes, down 3.5% in the second quarter, similar to the declines that we've experienced throughout 2014 and 2015. However, strong core price and positive volume in the high margin commercial and industrial lines of business led to our collection income from operations growing $44 million, and the operating margin growing 120 basis points. EBITDA grew $54 million, and EBITDA margin increased 150 basis points.", "In the landfill line of business, we again saw the benefits of both positive volume and positive yield in the second quarter, just as we did last year. Total landfill volumes increased 6.5%. Our landfill volume growth is very consistent with the volume growth over the past two years. MSW volumes grew by 5.2%, C&D volume grew 12.5%, and combined special waste and revenue generating cover volumes grew 4.4%. We achieved core price of 2.7%, an increase of 40 basis points from the second quarter of 2015, and saw same-store average MSW rates increase year-over-year by 1.9% from Q2 of 2015.", "Moving now to operating expenses. As a percent of revenue, those expenses improved 140 basis points to 62.2%. For the second quarter, operating expenses increased $22 million when compared to the second quarter of 2015. Landfill operating costs represented the largest increase, up $28 million. $22 million of the $28 million increase were the increased leachate cost, with the remaining $6 million increase related to the decline in the U.S. treasury rate used for discounting our long-term care obligations. The remainder of the operating cost dollar increase primarily relates to our increased volumes and cost related to acquired operations, which were partially offset by savings from lower fuel and risk management costs.", "For the second quarter as a percent of revenue, SG&A costs were 9.9%, up 20 basis points when compared to the second quarter of 2015. On a dollar basis, SG&A costs were $340 million, an increase of $18 million compared to 2015. Labor cost drove the majority of the increase, primarily related to acquisitions and higher accruals for stock-based incentive compensation. As you may recall, our stock-based incentive compensation is based upon performance in the areas of free cash flow and total shareholder return. And we've achieved strong performance in both metrics the last two years.", "In the second quarter, those costs increased $11 million when compared to the second quarter of 2015. We expect that these costs will exceed last year by about the same amount in the back half of the year. We still expect to improve SG&A cost as a percent of revenue for the full year when compared to 2015.", "Turning to cash flow in the second quarter. Cash provided by operating activities was $748 million, compared to $816 million in the second quarter of 2015. Our operations continue to perform very well as we achieved operating EBITDA increase of $76 million. However, this increase was more than offset by the impact of timing differences in cash tax payments of $75 million and working capital changes. We expect the working capital changes to even out over the remainder of the year.", "During the second quarter, we spent $312 million on capital expenditures, an increase of $16 million when compared to the second quarter of 2015. Through the first six months of 2016, CapEx has increased $100 million compared to 2015. A large portion of the increase relates to one-time capital spending for a leachate treatment facility and the timing of truck purchases. As a result, we now expect that capital expenditures will be between $1.4 billion and $1.45 billion for 2016. We do not believe that this year's increase in capital spending over our original guidance is a permanent increase due to the one-time nature of the extra spend.", "In the second quarter, we had $11 million in proceeds from divested assets, a decrease of $48 million from last year. Combined, we generated $447 million of free cash flow, and almost $849 million year-to-date. Given this strong first half performance, we're raising our free cash flow guidance to between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion. In the second quarter, we returned $431 million to shareholders. We paid $181 million in dividends and repurchased $251 million of shares.", "Finally, looking at our other financial metrics, at the end of the second quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio measured based on our bank covenants was 2.67 and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.22%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 10% at the end of the quarter. The effective tax rate was 37.6% in the second quarter. Adjusting for the impairments, tax rate was 34.7%. We still expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 35%.", "In summary, through the first six months of 2016, our employees have driven strong operational and financial performance that's exceeded our expectations. And for that, I want to thank them. The second half of 2016 we'll have tougher year-over-year comparisons. However, we're confident that we can execute our strategy to have a successful 2016.", "And with that Jinisha let's open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of Joe Box of KeyBanc Capital.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hey, good morning guys.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Morning.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning, Joe.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "I just wanted to flush out the better than expected performance within really just your gross margins here in the quarter, can \u2013 how much of that would you attribute to the volumes kind of really turning the corner here and maybe getting a little more route density within some of your higher margin businesses like commercial versus say the reduction in churn that you saw in the quarter and maybe not losing some of those more profitable existing customers?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I think they are two sides of the same coin, right. I mean, I think our performance on the volume side was driven by both. You can't have continued volume increases when you're leaking customers out at the backend. So, we've really done a nice job this year of not only adding more new business, but losing less of our business.", "And so what I'd say Joe is that, we did a great job on that front. But as we get the tools in place to really understand profitability by customer. We can be a lot more focused on maintaining the right customers rather than just retaining the right number of customers.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Joe, I would say on the operating \u2013 with respect to operating expenses, that was a good story as well. We were up $22 million if you exclude that pension charge last year, but you're up $22 million on 3.3% top-line growth. So if you adjust for revenue growth, our salary and wages line improved by about 20 basis points and we really overcame the merit increase \u2013 the annual merit increase of about 2.5% and that increase in landfill operating costs.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Got it. And I guess ultimately what I'm trying to get at it is, you've had the price lever that you've been pulling. Now you're starting to see volume. Obviously, you've been working the cost side, should we think about the incremental EBITDA margins maybe being north of that typical kind of 30-ish plus percent that I typically think about going forward? Is that a reasonable bogey?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Certainly on the commercial line that's a reasonable bogey. I mean, you hit on it earlier which is the route density, the ability for us to add the right customers in the right location at the right price is really the core to our sales and marketing efforts.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "And David, just to be cleared, I was talking total company not just commercial on that incremental EBITDA?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Well, the commercial line is \u2013 yes, you're absolutely right, certainly at the landfill line, it's higher than that. In the industrial line, it will be higher than that. But the commercial line is really where you get that benefit of added density.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "And then maybe just one last quick one, I'll turn it over. I think it's interesting that your commercial volumes are starting to turn the corner, really at the same time, it looks like the consumer maybe \u2013 could be getting a bit punkish. Are you thinking that this is going to be the beginning of a sustainable recovery in commercial volumes or would you caution us that it's going to be somewhat lumpy?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No, when you look at what's happened to our commercial volume over the last, call it, 10 quarters. It's been a really steady progression of about 0.5% to 0.8% every single quarter. And so, the beauty of the commercial line of business is once you signup those customers, unless they go out business, they're with you for a long time. And with the churn rate going down, I would say we are at the beginning of the cycle, nowhere near the end.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Joe, I'd also add that most of our new customers, our greenfield sites, new customers, new startups, it's about at the 60% mark of new customers. So that tells you there is some economy positives occurring.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. I appreciate the color. Thank you, guys.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia of Credit Suisse.", "Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Hey, guys. Thanks for my question.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure.", "Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "So, just looking at your volumes, I mean, so now we've got our second quarter in a row of positive volumes, how did it track towards what you guys were expecting in the quarter, I know we had a lot of noise last quarter, but were these better than you expected? And then, how do things trend through July so far?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I'd say they're a little bit ahead of where we expected. Like I said, the commercial line of business has been a very easy pattern to follow. The march has been very steady at about a 0.5 point to 1 point improvement every quarter. Obviously, the industrial line is a little bit more seasonal, and we probably had some of those volumes move into the first quarter, with the stronger construction season in the first quarter. The landfill line again has been a pretty steady march, again a little bit of extra volume probably in the first quarter. So I'd say we're a little bit ahead of where we are, but we don't expect the trend to change. That's why we think that we're on a very good march towards that positive 1% plus volumes by the end of the year.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Andrew, the big question that we had really at the end of the first quarter was how much volume did we borrow, because of the mild weather that David mentioned, how much did we borrow in Q1 from Q2. And that borrowing would have occurred really in two lines of business, it would have occurred in the roll off line of business primarily within the temporary roll off component. And then it would have occurred in the landfill line of business.", "And looking at it, it looks like if you adjust out the added work day that we had in Q1, we think we probably borrowed somewhere in neighborhood of 60 basis points to 80 basis points of volume in those two lines of business, but still when you look at a 150 basis point improvement in the industrial versus last year and commercial being up 250 basis points which didn't see any borrowing from Q1 to Q2. We felt pretty good about volume in Q2 and as David said, probably a little bit ahead of where we expected to be, particularly on the commercial line.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And with respect to last part of the questions, obviously it's still early, but July volumes continue to show the steady progression.", "Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. Let's get into July, I mean you said, you could probably do better than that 1%. But, I guess what's the hesitation there, I mean are there some pretty large contracts rolling off in Q3 and Q4 or is it just tough comps or what, I guess what do we expect into the second half?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, obviously, the comps get a little bit tougher that. And so, there is no, there are no big contracts. In fact, we have a couple of contracts on our national accounts side, that will be coming on in the back half of the year. And so, there really aren't any large volume losses like we've had in the past few years, particularly in the residential line of business. But there are a little bit tougher year-over-year comps.", "Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. Got it. Thanks, guys.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman of Stifel.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hi, David, Jim, Jim, how are you today?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Michael.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "So, I have a question on the price side. You noted that you had a delta of about 80 basis points year-over-year on the core but you had a 90 basis points on yield on a \u2013 in the inside solid waste. So you clearly, that's the right direction. You're retaining more price within the core. What are you doing proactively to offset the leakage from $450-ish million of price you're going to the market with versus what you reporting?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Michael, as you've heard us talk about that's our Periscope project and Jim Trevathan is leading that, so maybe he can talk a little bit about what we're doing with Periscope.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Michael, I \u2013 I \u2013 you've noticed well because that is absolutely true. Part of it can be mixed, that we don't have control over. But what we do have control over, we're seeing the benefit of that. We're retaining more of that price. Periscope and it's a self service analytical platform, it really marries kind of revenue cost unit data, gives us profitability and trending profitability. We can do it, Michael, by customer, by sales rep, we can do it by customer segment or a sales channel by route, geography.", "It really will help us as we move forward. We're about halfway through, rolling it out to our 17 areas. Not all of them are executing with it. We're in the final steps of putting together a playbook that really will be because the analytics are so intuitive and so obvious, it will be really heavy on action. What do we do with the tool to get benefit? Most of that will come as we finish the rollout in Q4 and especially into 2017. But, for those areas that have been \u2013 have had it up and running, we see the benefit. We also see some real strong effort just in execution by our team on retaining those higher margin customers. And I think that plays into that yield positive as well. We've got really good processes that are being executed across the areas to retain customers and our operating team is providing a lot better service that we measure really consistently with real accountability processes. I think that trend will continue.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And based on the early rollouts, where it's been in for a while, what's the pace of that gap narrowing, I mean is it 10 basis points a quarter or is 20 basis points or 30 basis points quarter?", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Michael, we've got, I don't have the number in front of me, but we've piloted in the Southeast and that's one of our highest yield and our most improved from a retention standpoint area. So we see the benefit of that from that area using it and implementing the tool.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then on volume, if I follow the path of the sequential progression and you exit the year at over 1%, but it feels like you start the year at almost 2%, based on that \u2013 I mean the reported number will be over 1%, but you're starting 2017 at 2% on volume. Am I being overly optimistic about your volume outlook for 2017?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Obviously, we put our budgets together in the October-November timeframe. So, we'll look at it then and where we are at that point in time, but what I've said Michael is that I do think we're progressing towards that what I call the 2% price, 2% volume, the 2x2. I've said that it's probably 18 months away, but as we put together our budgets for 2017, hopefully we'll see it on the horizon a little sooner.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then, there's lots of hand ringing in the stock market about the economy and recession here, there, Brexit all that. Can we break into two sort of pieces of your business. So the part that Harry Lamberton runs that approximately $1 billion that's industrial. If I pull out the energy waste business, which I get is down for secular reasons, what's the rest of the trend, and are you seeing any recessionary signs?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "No. It's interesting because you hear everybody talking about this industrial recession that's going on in the U.S., and I would tell you we're not seeing at our \u2013 our C&D volume, which is part of the industrial line of business, and then our special waste volumes are probably the best gauges of the economy \u2013 that part of the economy. And they're pretty strong, both were solid in Q2. June was the strongest month for the quarter, and July shows continued strength. So we're just not seeing the industrial recession. Now, maybe it's because we're at the backend of the cycle, but I would tell you, we're \u2013 even when we look at our special waste pipeline, it looks pretty strong. So, I'd tell you we're not seeing what the rest of the country seems to be talking about.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And Michael, I'm not sure when the country talked about an industrial recession, I think they're thinking about things like automobiles and refrigerators. I think Houston is sort of indicative of the country, which is the west side of Houston is not doing so great because of low oil prices, but the east side of Houston, when you go to Beaumont, Lake Charles the spots where we have our industrial landfill base because of the low energy price inputs, those places are booming. You can't buy a house in Beaumont, not that anyone would want to.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Be careful.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "But that's \u2013 yeah, that's a wonderful city. But the chemical corridor is doing spectacularly well, certainly is not in any kind of industrial recession. So, when we look at our overall industrial business, it's actually performing very well.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then, if I follow that through on the consumer side. So every restaurant company in the country, that's casual or fast casual is reporting lousy comps. So, yeah, you would have shown positive commercial volume. And I think the restaurant comp issue is they thought their comps were going to be three and four and they're coming in at one and two and that's deemed lousy. How do you see like the commercial market in the context of like \u2013 end markets like restaurants or the entertainment or services sector?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. The overall commercial business as Jim Trevathan mentioned with about 60% to 70% of our new business coming from greenfields, which are our brand new operating businesses. It seemed to us that the whole commercial end market is very strong. We don't look at it necessarily by the various segments but the end market actually seems to be very strong.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "All right. And then last one from me. On your free cash flow raise $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion, how many dollars of one-time that are unique to 2016 are in that $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "There's probably three numbers that really matter in that, Michael. You've got the one-time CapEx piece and that's about $100 million and that's offset by kind of a one-time cash flow monetization \u2013 cash taxes monetization. So those two offset one another at about $100 million apiece. And then you've got just the business itself growing at about $100 million coming in through the EBITDA line.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. That's great to know. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Corey Greendale of First Analysis.", "Ken C. Wang - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Thank you. This is Ken Wang on for Corey. Just focusing on the decline in recycling volume this quarter, which I believe may be a part of the volume you're shedding. Can you speak a bit about the dynamics here just given that commodity prices have been on an upward trajectory recently?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. The bulk of those \u2013 of those volume declines were large contracts, where we were losing money and we rebid them to make money and someone else took the contract. And so losing those volumes is the best thing we can do for recycling because they were literally negative margin volumes.", "Ken C. Wang - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then kind of on the same topic. I know you put into place recycling contracts that limit price exposure. And again with prices up for commodities, how will this affect the bottom line? Is there kind of a formula that you can give us or some kind of rule of thumb?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, and look, prices are up, not dramatically, just in that 2% to 3% range \u2013 for the quarter. So, not a dramatic increase in price. And as we look forward, remember, every year, you seem to have that seasonal uptick and then starting in July, it starts to tick down. So, we're not certain that we're going to see that benefit in the back half of the year. But, generally what we say is that every $10 in commodity prices equates to about $30 million of EBIT for us. And so what we've tried do in this business is to make sure that if commodity prices go down, our earnings don't take a negative hit, but if commodity prices go up, they take a positive hit. So we've tried to de-risk the business. So that there's no downside, only upside. If the commodity prices go down in the back half of the year, we think we can offset that with operational improvement. So, we don't expect any negative benefit in the back half of the year, if we see anything in the back half of the year, it will be a positive benefit from recycling.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And if you look at the whole first half of the year on recycling, while we were up in commodity prices for Q2 by about 2.3%, we're actually down still year-to-date over 4% in commodity prices and, to David's point, we think that'll probably even out, we're cautiously optimistic because of the dynamic that he mentioned with kind of high prices in Q2 and then they tail off in Q3 and Q4, but we're cautiously optimistic that we might be able to get to flat pricing. All of the benefit that you're seeing from recycling, a big chunk of the benefit you're seeing from recycling for us has been on the OpEx side where we've taken quite a bit of OpEx out for the first six months and we'll continue to do so in the back half.", "Ken C. Wang - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Thank you.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yep. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk of Wedbush Securities.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Good morning, everyone.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hey, Al.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "From LA, I should say, right, as opposed to Houston. On the recycling piece, we can talk a little further on that please, a clarification. A couple years ago, you called out and I think it was actually dollar valued sort of the improvement that you were looking for operationally. A lot of it was through negotiating and re-negotiating contracts. Some of the commodity price headwinds et cetera. But where are we at in terms of that tailwind on the improvement? You earned $0.01, I think this quarter, or you commented that I think you had $0.01, which is the first time you turned profitable in a while and so, maybe I'll just leave it at that and let you take it from there to see if you can share an update on where you are at.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah sure. We're about 75% to 80% of the way through what I'd call those negative margin contracts. We still have a couple more that will roll off over the next six months to nine months. And so, and that's why say in the back half of the year, being 75% to 80% through those contracts, obviously we still have 20% to 25% that have some exposure to downward commodity prices. But, if that 20% to 25% sees downward commodity prices, we do think we can offset that with operational improvement. So, that's why I say in the back half of the year, there really is only upside from recycling. There really isn't much downside. Now, as we look back into the back half of year, we're not counting on a dramatic commodity price increase. But any commodity price increase that we have obviously falls straight to the bottom line.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "All right. Are you hearing from customers in terms of new service adds in this area, are people \u2013 municipalities in particular \u2013 are they still \u2013 do they get it yet in terms of understanding the cost?. I know your messaging has been very direct there. But what's the feedback that you're getting as folks are looking at the service?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Look, I think they get it. It's been a very prolonged downturn. This has been a different downturn than we've ever seen in the recycling markets. And so, I think they get it. Now, early on in the cycle you had some people that came in and bid some of these contracts under the old methodology, right. And they're not very happy with those contracts right now. So, in my mind, it sort of follows the same cycle that we saw with the fuel surcharge back in the early 2000s where initially people go well, we will count on the markets bouncing back. So we'll continue to bid under the old model. They're now stuck with three-year to five-year contracts where they're going to lose money for three years to five years. The next time those contracts come up, they will be bid more rationally. So, not only do the municipalities get it but I think that, that the recycling business community gets it too. And so, I think what you'll see is a much more rational bidding behavior over the next five years.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Switching gears on the industrial side, you guys were on record in talking about this being a very, very strong growth area for you. It suggests to me it was more M&A implied but also organically. Could you talk about the environment there? There's certainly been a few companies that have struggled in this area. We've had a fair amount of tailwind from sort of the energy comps, which largely now I think is dissipated out of the numbers, so-called easy comps, but and then I think Jim made some comments earlier about the C&D and special waste but just talk about you put up 9.5% price, which I think was pretty, you got that number right, correct. Where do we go from here?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Al, there is a couple of components of that industrial line of business. It's a big category. Of course energy services, I mean that we've had some questions, when we've been out talking to investors about are you seeing your energy services business coming back because you're seeing the price of oil bouncing back up and what we've said is look, energy services is really not so much driven by the price of oil, as it is driven by drilling activity and we've not seen drilling activity rebound in the form of recounts. So, the energy service piece is still pretty soft year-over-year. It's a pretty big negative for us that we've fought back against.", "Coal ash is another component. Coal ash, as you know, we have a big Duke contract that \u2013 that is proceeding well for us. And we're seeing some, certainly seeing the landfill impact from that contract. The utilities \u2013 the public utilities are out there developing their coal combustion residual plants at each \u2013 for each plant. And we expect that those plants will result in a combination of kind of onsite work and some offsite disposal for us, in the next few years.", "So, coal ash will be good. I would tell you that, that for the most of these companies prefer to handle it onsite, prefer beneficial reuse, we can handle all three. But we'll certainly see some benefit in addition the new contract. C&D, we talked about. C&D has been strong and I would tell you that in talking to one of our area Vice Presidents, who has a strong C&D market right now, he believes that that's part of what's affecting his commercial volume is that David has said it many times, it's when you start seeing these big tracks of land being taken out and we get that C&D business. That maybe the more beneficial side of that is getting the commercial volume the permanent business on the backend of that.", "And this \u2013 this VP seems to think that's exactly what's going on and then, there are couple of other components within the industrial line of business as well. But overall I think, industrial looks to be reasonably strong for us and it appears to be continuing down that path.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Great. Jim, on your coal ash opportunity, there are a couple of companies. One in particular that has a fair amount of relationships with the utilities on the sort of selling that ash out for beneficial reuse. Is M&A an opportunity for you guys here? Understanding that disposal or the offsite work you certainly are set up for. But wondering about the onsite work \u2013 onsite work excuse me and the marketing of ash?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. So, M&A is an opportunity for us there. Although, we've bought a company called FlashDirect a couple of years ago. And they have really grown tremendously since the acquisition of since we acquired them a couple of years ago. So, while we're always looking for proprietary technologies and that's what FlashDirect brought to us.", "Right now, we feel good with that acquisition, but not to say we wouldn't look at another acquisition there or in any other space, in energy services for example, it's got to be properly priced and we don't want to kind of buy at the bottom, but and we can talk more about M&A later. But, yeah, we'd certainly be interested in acquisitions, we just need to make sure it's the right technology and provides the right returns.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Great. Finally David, if I can come back to your comment on your prepared remarks, I think you said that core price 4%, yield was 2%, and then you followed that with, it could moderate in the second half of 2016. Help me appreciate what you were \u2013 I won't say thinking at...", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. What I meant, Al, was that our original targets were 4% core price, 2% yield. We're going to exceed those, there is no doubt about it. This quarter it was 4.9%, so well above our target and 2.6%, well above our 2% target. And so, on the back half of the year, we've got some CPI headwinds, we've got some year-over-year comp issues, we've got the timing of price increases, so it might moderate a little bit. But, nothing dramatic, nothing that will dramatically affect profitability, we still expect that have a great back half of the year. And for the full-year, we'll clearly exceed that 4% core price target and that 2% yield target.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Okay. So, you're saying moderate from the 4.9% and 2.6%?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Exactly.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "All right. We'll look forward to seeing the results. Thanks a lot.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Al.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer.", "Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Yes, thank you, good morning. Just wondering, if we can touch on the residential portion of the business. You did shed some of the unprofitable volumes. Can you give us an update on how you're tracking with migrating to the Waste CPI sub index, something that I know certainly competitors talked about quite a bit. Can you give us a way to sort of measure where you are in the progress of that initiative.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Noah, Jim Trevathan, here. We absolutely are focused on it not just with the residential line of business but with our national account business. With CPI obviously below one and not looking for any real strength in that number. We have migrated in that regard. We're \u2013 on new contracts, that is the goal of every new contract to have a metric that is closer to our cost increases rather than CPI. And we're on the residential side probably a third of the way through. On the national account side, we're getting a different metric on every renewal of a contract. It may not be the full wastewater treatment metric, that's generally 200 basis points, 300 basis points higher than CPI. But we see that as the way forward to minimize the margin deterioration as our costs go up, but yet CPI stays below one. So that is absolutely a focus and we're little less than halfway through, but again those are long-term contracts. So, as they change, that's the goal.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Noah, even with the positive progress that Jim just talked about on shifting within these contracts, it's no secret that resi is a top line of business for us and I think it \u2013 to me it highlights the need for good solid disposal pricing. And we believe that we've made some progress on disposal pricing not as much as we would like part of \u2013 you will see an improvement as our charge kind of \u2013 how do we put it, in last quarter actually started on July 1. Starts to kind of come to fruition, but look that line of business has in all honesty has been a disappointment for us. We are doing a lot to try and fix it and part of that is addressing it on the disposal side of our business.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "And, Noah, an example of that \u2013 of that focus, on the residential line we were over 2% in yield for the quarter where we haven't been over 2% for a couple of years on the resi line of business.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "So we're making real progress, that's measurable.", "Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. That is incredibly helpful. Thank you. That additional $100 million to $200 million of free cash flow, a nice upward revision there. Wondering kind of how you are thinking about allocation generally these days, how are you looking at the M&A landscape, certainly a rising tide tend to lift all boats and potentially evaluations. But we are seeing more indiscrete discipline on a number of fronts. So, wondering, how you're thinking about the M&A opportunities and also what kind of opportunities you are seeing for any kind of asset swaps and market consolidation?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. when we look at the \u2013 at the acquisition market, basically the last three years, we've done a moderate size deal each year that added sort of that $50 million to $75 million of EBITDA. So, we did Deffenbaugh \u2013 RCI in Montreal, Deffenbaugh in Kansas City and then SWS in South Florida.", "And we really don't see another one of those on the horizon. We've looked at a number of deals, in the Southeast and some other places where, what you've said is exactly right, sellers have gotten a little bit undisciplined on what they want. We're generally willing to pay sort of six times to eight times EBITDA, given the synergies we can pull out. For a bigger deal, we might pay 7 times to 9 times EBITDA, again, because we can get good synergies and post synergies, we can get it at sort of 6 times to 7.5 times EBITDA. The part of the problem is we've got a lot of the solid waste sellers that want 12 times EBITDA, and that's just not a number that really works for us. And so, we really don't see one of those decent sized solid waste acquisitions on the near horizon. We aren't looking dramatically outside of our core solid waste. As Jim said, if we saw some opportunistic buying on the industrial side or energy services, we'd look at that, but we are not currently actively looking at anything in that arena.", "And so, we're sort of back to what I'd say are our smaller tuck-in acquisitions, sort of the $10 million to $20 million type acquisitions. And we've asked our business developers to pick up the pace on those to make up for the fact that we don't have any of those larger transactions on the horizon. And so, you know the deal. These things go in cycles. There are not a lot of buyers out there, you really haven't seen a dramatic amount of activity in the M&A side. And so \u2013 and I think that's probably because a lot of these sellers have heightened expectations, as the industry dynamics have improved, I would say that the industry is showing just as much discipline on the M&A side as they are on the operational and pricing side, no one is out there paying crazy numbers. So, those businesses are going to be sold, it's just the matter of when they get to a reasonable multiple.", "Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah. Yep. Well, thank you very much, and congrats on the quarter.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Levine of Imperial Capital.", "Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Morning, Scott.", "Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "Just want to push a little bit more on the guidance revision. And what's behind, it looks like the recycling business did a little better than you were budgeting for in the first half of the year. 1Q exceptionally strong, volumes seasonally \u2013 maybe a little bit more detail on explicitly what's behind the guidance raise. And also you know, I know you don't give guidance first half versus second half per se, but is this mostly just outperformance in the first half or is it factors that should continue to lend themselves to upside in the back half of the year and beyond?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. When I look at the first half of the year and the outperformance in recycling, the outperformance in recycling is sort of offset by the underperformance on our leachate costs, which as we've said were up $22 million this quarter. And so those \u2013 actually that's a slight negative overall. And so from an \u2013 from a business point of view, when I look at the year, it's the plain and simple stuff, it's the blocking and tackling, price, volume and cost control, right. And we've seen steady progress on all three of those. We don't expect that to slow down. And so, the back half of the year, it obviously ramps up a little bit more than the first half of the year. But, we're pretty optimistic that we're going to continue to see the strong performance continue. Again it's blocking and tackling \u2013 price, volume, costs.", "Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "Got it. Fair enough. Thanks. And as my follow-up, not to beat the dead horse on residential. But, I don't recall, I think you said, Jim, down 3.5% on volume. I don't recall offhand if that's better than it's been or maybe just a little bit more elaboration on what's driving the weakness. And it sounds like you're doing some things on the pricing side that are working well. But, how fixable is this or is this kind of an industry phenomenon and how confident are you that this business just in general that the metrics improve going forward?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Look it's about the same. I mean last quarter it was negative 3.4%. We've had some 2.6% and last year we had a couple of negative 3.6% on volume. So it's not been a great volume business for us. By the way, a lot of that is by design, but I think the changes that Jim talked about in those contracts are kind of back to David's point about de-risking the business or helping to de-risk the line of business. And then I think it's very important that we \u2013 we've had some very stiff competition within the resi line of business and so it's important for us to continue to push disposal price increases in addition to collection price increases. We're pushing collection price increases through this residential line of business on our customers, but I think it's important that we push disposal price increases on our third-party customers as well. They should have to pay their fair share.", "Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "Is it a certain class of competitor, where you're seeing the issues of large residential contracts or it's just intense competition for them and landfill prices delever to drive improvement or is there more to it than that?", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes, Scott, Jim Trevathan. I think part of the issue on some of that volume loss, not all of it, but enough that it's measurable are from our local competitors. When you look at interest rates where they are. They can lease trucks at a really low cost and come in and take some of the neighborhoods for example that are around the Houston area. Now they probably don't have the capital, the capability from a capital standpoint to handle one of the larger locations or franchises, but they put pricing pressure on some of those local neighborhoods, where they can get a couple of trucks really, really inexpensively and that's part of the effect. What we do is look at it from an integrated standpoint as Jim Fish said. We're integrated and we're taking the \u2013 handling the disposal internally and it's not flow controlled to another disposal site then, we're going to retain that business. Where it's not we'll turn that volume loose where it's a low collection margin and put that capital to work at a place that we get a better return.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And the beauty of that is when you see that local competitor take on sort of a moderate sized residential contract. Generally, what happens is they lose their focus on the commercial and the industrial side. So, they're adding trucks on the residential side. We don't have any problem with that, as long as they're not adding trucks on the commercial industrial side.", "So, for us, it's really a matter of balance, where do you want to invest your capital? And for us, we'd much rather invest our capital on the commercial industrial side than on the residential side.", "Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "Understood. Appreciate the color. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Feniger of Bank of America ML.", "Michael J. Feniger - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.", "Thanks guys. With maybe not a large transaction on the horizon and with free cash flow coming in stronger than expected, could we maybe see more put to share buybacks or dividend growth perhaps, how are you guys thinking about that?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. It's really a great question. And look, as we've said many times, our first priority would be to reinvest it in the business through acquisitions. The fact that we don't have one on the horizon doesn't mean, these things \u2013 these things happens fairly quickly. So, we want to make sure that we keep enough powder dry that if something comes along, we're able to act and act fast without leveraging up the balance sheet too dramatically.", "And so, we're always going to save a little bit of a dry powder to make sure that we can do any of those acquisitions that come along. And then, when we look at it, obviously our dividend yield has gone down with the stock price going up. And so, at the end of the year, when we look at our dividend, I would expect that we'll see another good increase in the dividend coming into the back half of the year.", "And then, on the share repurchase side, the bulk of the remainder of our cash goes to our share repurchase. We don't really time share repurchases. And so, we're going to ultimately do sort of $500 million to $800 million of share repurchases every year and I'd expect to see that continue.", "Michael J. Feniger - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.", "Great. And on the churn rate I guess, how low can that go? What's the ceiling or I guess, the better term is the floor? How should we think about that progression?", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Michael, we \u2013 we ask ourselves that same question regularly. In the vicinity of 5% is structural churn, it's businesses, small businesses that open and then come and go. So, we probably at this point, have about 400 basis points to play with. I fully expect it to stay in single-digits and whether \u2013 our next goal is to get it below that 9% number and into the 8%'s.", "I think that is an achievable goal over the next few quarters, next year or two and that's what we're after. That's affected both by service, by how we handle customer issues as they come up. I think the Periscope tool will help us in that regard and help us focus price increases on customer segments that tend to accept them better and therefore reduce that churn number.", "Some of the process issues I mentioned earlier will help us in that regard, but a lot of it boils down to much better just front line service provision that our field guys are 100% focused on.", "Michael J. Feniger - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.", "Great. Thanks guys.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Tyler Brown of Raymond James.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey good morning guys.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Morning, Tyler.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Morning.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey congrats on the swinging the pendulum over to the positive side on commercial volume, but Jim Trevathan, can you talk a little bit about the frontload fleet to how much excess capacity do you think you have in that fleet and how much of volume growth do you think you could absorb before you would have to see a bump in CapEx?", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Tyler, we have plenty of capacity. There are a handful of markets, where we've added some frontload capacity on the route side, but our system has plenty of capacity when you look across the whole network to handle more volume. There are places as I said earlier that we've added routes, but with the tools that we now have to service delivery optimization and SDO with the onboard computers. When we add that we're adding it at that low cost basis rather than just a truck handling a handful of customers, we re-route regularly with that tool and make sure that the efficiency numbers stay up and they have as we've added volume in high growth market. So, I don't think you're going to see the huge impact whether it's to efficiency, you will see most of those dollars on the commercial customer additions going to the bottom line.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay.", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "By the way Tyler and we're buying more trucks this year. We're probably going to buy 10% more trucks this year than last year. So, we are buying some additional trucks you can imagine, we're not buying a lot of resi-trucks so most of them are going up on the industrial line of business and also the commercial line.", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Right, we'll about 1,300, 1315 trucks this year versus 1,120 last year. So we see that upside and yet our efficiency Tyler is still positive about 1% year-to-date. That's a good number for us compared to historic numbers.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Yeah. That was actually my second question. So is that 1,300, is that a heightened replacement or is that a more of a normal replacement cycle, I assume it heightened?", "James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. It's heightened somewhat, especially as Jim said on the industrial side, because we're seeing more growth there and have consistently over the last couple of years. But it's \u2013 you're going to see it stay in that vicinity, we expect that volume as Dave said earlier, to go past one and we'll continue in that 1,300 or so trucks on just a replacement basis.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And then Jim Fish, maybe I'm read into a little bit. But did your comments kind of indicate that CapEx would decline in 2017, given the leachate investments or do those stick around into 2017 just anyway to think about that?", "James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Specific to the leachate investment, yeah, I think you're going to see a decline because as we talked about that kind of $100 million, not all of it is, it is the leachate plant, or the waste water treatment plant. But yeah, specific to that they will decline now, there are some other things that could affect it, if we win a big contract for example next year that might offset some of that. But not knowing that at this point, I would say that we would see at least a partial decline off of this kind of $1.4 billion or $1.45 billion number.(1:02:10)", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Very helpful. And then this is a housekeeping question. I apologize, I got on the call late, I may have missed it, but what was the $40 million expense in the other line that was below EBIT and can you give us any help on how to think about that line going forward?", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. That's the impairment of some conversion technology investment that we had.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. All right. Perfect. Thank you.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. David Steiner for an announcement and closing remarks.", "David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you. In a year where there doesn't seem to be a lot of good presidential news, we actually have some very good presidential news here at Waste Management. Today, we'll be issuing a press release and we're going to file an 8-K, announcing that we're promoting Jim Fish to the role of President. I wish I could promote him to role of President of the United States, but unfortunately all I can do is promote him to President of Waste Management. As part of our ongoing succession planning process, the board and I felt that the next logical step in that process was for us to name Jim President. We are conducting a search for a new Chief Financial Officer, who will report to Jim and while that search is underway, Jim will retain his CFO responsibilities.", "Obviously, you all on the phone know Jim very well. Many of you have worked with him for a while now, so you know why the board and I have such confidence in him. He has really been pivotal to the success of our company and he's also a talented leader with tremendous knowledge of all aspects of our business. The promotion is a well deserved recognition of his past accomplishments and another step in his development as a leader. I'm sure, you'll join me, our board, our senior leadership team and the rest of our Waste Management family in congratulating Jim on this great achievement.", "And with that operator, we will see you next quarter. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you for participating in today's Waste Management conference call.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the express written consent of Waste Management is prohibited.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's President and CEO, David Steiner.", "David Steiner", "Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. Our third quarter results exceeded our internal expectations. As we have all year, we saw improving volumes strong attitudes in our pricing programs and continue traction in our cost programs.", "Each of our net income, operating income and margin, operating EBITDA and margin and earnings per diluted share improved when compared to the third quarter of 2015. And during the third quarter, we achieved the significant milestone as our operating EBITDA exceeded $1 billion for the first time. We earned $0.84 per share in the third quarter, an increase of 13.5% from our third quarter 2015 results. Our continued growth and earnings translated into strong generation of cash flow from operations, which grew $96 million in the third quarter and drove year-to-date cash from operations to over $2.2 billion, that\u2019s almost a 12% increase over last year.", "So, we\u2019re very pleased with the momentum that we built in the first three quarters of the year, which we expect to continue into the fourth quarter and extend it to 2017. Our pricing programs are significant reason for our earnings growth and margin expansion. For the third quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.7%, and collection and disposal yield was 2.1% with total company yield at 2.6%. Core price improved 70 basis points from the third quarter of 2015. Core price in the industrial line was 8.6%, in the commercial line it was 7%; and in both our landfill and residential lines, it was 2.6%.", "Importantly, we demonstrated our continued ability to increase prices while retaining customers through improved customer service. As our churn rate dropped to 8.7%, that\u2019s 170 basis points better than last year and 40 basis points better than the second quarter of 2016, this is the lowest churn that we've seen since before 2015. It attributes to our customer service and operations folks who work together to create a better customer experience.", "With respect to volumes, we continue to see positive volume growth in the third quarter just as we have all year. In the quarter, we saw volumes in our high margin commercial, industrial and our landfill lines of business continue to grow, and we saw an improvement in the rate of decline of residential volumes. On traditional solid waste volumes were positive 1.6% in the third quarter 2016, a 170 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2015, and an 80 basis point improvement sequentially from the second quarter of 2016. And our overall volume was also a positive of 1.6%, as our national accounts and recycling segments contributed positively to volume growth in the quarter.", "Our entire team continues to execute on our strategy of maintaining price, adding high margin business and improving customer service, and the results continue to impress. Our landfill line of business continues to shows strong results too, which Jim will discuss in more detail; however, as we previously mentioned reaching the significant increase in the cost of managing the liquid that occurred in our landfill. In the third quarter of 2016, the increase in leachate cost was about $23 million or a drag of $0.03 per share.", "We continue to rollout our Waste Water management chart to our landfill customers through our under long-term contracts. However, the charge is fully implemented on our spot customers. So, in the third quarter, we added approximately to 0.2% to landfill yield from implementing the charge, with almost no pushback. However, we still have a long way to go before we can recover the full cost. It\u2019s important that we pass the cost increases onto our customers, so that we can achieve an appropriate return on investment on our landfill assets. But just like when we implemented fuel surcharge, it will take time to fully implement discharge.", "Turning to recycling, we saw a 13.6% increase in average commodity prices at our recycling facilities for the quarter and a 0.9% increase in the volumes. Year-over-year, the recycling line of business contributed almost $0.03 per share to earnings, which helped to offset the $0.03 of increased leachate cost. The improvement in earnings was driven by about $0.01 from pricing and about $0.02 from operational improvements at our recycling plants and our continued efforts to improve our contracts.", "On the operational side, our recycling employees have done a nice job on improving operational efficiencies, such as reducing downtime events through preventative maintenance practices, educating customers about contamination and charging for contamination all ridges. This led to gross operating expenses improving 4.5% in the third quarter; and on the contract side, we continue to work with customers on more fair contract terms to allow Waste Management to remain their recycling partner and provide us with a sustainable business model.", "So, we\u2019re very pleased with our third quarter results as well as our results through the first nine months of 2016. We are proud of hard work all of our employees have done to-date to exceed our expectations for yield, volume, earnings and cash flow generation. Consequently, we are again raising our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance for 2016. We are confident that we can achieve consensus for the fourth quarter, which would put us at $2.91 of EPS for the full year.", "Cash flow continues to be strong, and we remain confident that we can achieve our free cash flow guidance for 2016 of between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion. As we move towards the end of the year, we will do what we have done in the past few years where we estimate full year cash flow and determine, if we want prepay up to a $100 million of our 2017 capital spend or taxes. I want to thank all of our team members for demonstrating once again why they are the best in the business.", "I will now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our third quarter results in more detail.", "Jim Fish", "Thanks, David. The third quarter was indeed another strong quarter for us. Revenues on the quarter were $3.55 billion, an increase of a $188 million or 5.6% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. We saw a $110 million increase in our collection and disposal business from a combined price impacts of pricing and volume. A $60 million increase in revenues from acquisitions net of divestitures, and recycling revenues increased $27 million. These increases were partially offset by an $11 million decline related to lower fuel surcharge revenues.", "Foreign currency fluctuations had no material impact on revenues, compared to the third quarter of 2015. Looking at internal revenue growth for the Company, in the third quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.7% and yield was 2.1% with total volumes improving 1.6%. Volumes were positive for the third consecutive quarter. The combined positive price and positive volume led to total company income from operations growing $65 million, operating income margin expanding 90 basis points to 18.8%, operating EBITDA growing $71 million and operating EBITDA margin growing 50 basis points to 28.2%.", "Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefits of improving volume. Industrial volume was up 1.9% in the third quarter, a 150 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2015, and a 40 basis point improvement sequentially.", "Commercial line of business showed strong momentum with volumes up 1.2% in the third quarter. A 250 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2015 and a 90 basis point improvement from the second quarter of 2016. While our residential business volumes were down 2.9% in the third quarter, this reflected a 70 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2015 and a 60 basis point improvement sequentially from the second quarter. Overall our collection income from operations grew $26 million and EBITDA grew $38 million in the third quarter.", "In the landfill line of business, we again saw the benefits of both positive volume and positive yield in the third quarter, just as we saw in the first and second quarters of this year. Total landfill volumes increased 6.9%. MSW volumes grew 6.1%, C&D volume grew 22%, and combined special waste and revenue generating cover volumes grew 6.7%. More than half of the growth in C&D was due to storm clean up in Louisiana, but underlying trends remain strong. We achieved core price of 2.6%, an increase of 30 basis points from the third quarter of 2015. The combined positive price and volume in the landfill line of business led to income from operations and EBITDA each growing $12 million in the third quarter.", "Moving now to operating expenses. As a percent of revenue, these expenses increased to 10 basis points to 62.5%. For the third quarter, operating expenses increased to $121 million when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Landfill operating costs represented the largest increase, up $29 million. $23 million of the $29 million increase were the increased leachate cost, which equated to 60 basis points to the percent of revenue. The remainder of the operating cost dollar increase related primarily to our increased volumes and costs from acquired operations, with labor costs increasing $28 million, cost of goods sold increasing $25 million, and subcontractor costs increasing $22 million. These increases were partially offset by savings from lower fuel costs. Over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect to see operating expense margin improvements as we add waste water treatment capacity and as our increased fuel fleet purchases and MSPO initiative began to positively impact maintenance costs.", "For the third quarter as a percent of revenue, SG&A costs were 9.3%, an improvement of 50 basis points when compared to the third quarter of 2015. On a dollar basis, SG&A costs were $330 million, a slight improvement compared to 2015. We've done a nice job controlling SG&A costs as increases in wages and compensation have been offset by other improvements.", "Turning to cash flow for the third quarter. Cash provided by operating activities was $753 million, compared to $657 million in the third quarter of 2015. Our operations continue to perform very well as cash flow was driven largely by an operating EBITDA increase of $71 million. During the third quarter, we spent $333 million on capital expenditures, a decrease of $2 million when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Through the first nine months of 2016, we have spent $962 million on capital expenditures, an increase of $98 million when compared to the first nine months of 2015. We still expect the capital expenditures will be between $1.4 billion and $1.45 billion for the full year 2016.", "In the third quarter, we had $8 million in proceeds from divested assets, a decrease of $28 million from the prior year quarter. Combined, we generated $428 million of free cash flow, a $70 million increase compared to the third quarter of 2015. Year-to-date, we have achieved free cash flow of $1.28 billion. We remain confident in achieving our full year 2016 free cash flow guidance of between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion. In the third quarter, we paid $182 million in dividends to our shareholders. While we didn't repurchase any shares during the third quarter, we currently plan to start buying back our stock again in the fourth quarter when the window opens. We expect that these late 2016 and early 2017 repurchases will allow us to completely offset the 2017 dilution impacts of our equity compensation plans.", "Finally, looking at our other financial metrics, at the end of the third quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio measured based on our bank covenants was 2.56 and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.17%. The floating rate portion of our debt portfolio was 13% at the end of the quarter. The effective tax rate was 33.7% in the third quarter. Adjusting for the impairments, the tax rate was 33.5%. We still expect that our full year as adjusted tax rate will be approximately 35%.", "In summary, year-to-date 2016 has been a very successful year, driven by the exceptional performance from our employees. I want to thank them for their efforts through the first nine months. I know they are working hard to improve our operational and financial performance for the remainder of 2016 and into 2017, and we are confident that they will be successful.", "And with that Jinisha, let\u2019s open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instruction] And your first question comes from Noah Kaye.", "Noah Kaye", "I would just like to start with maybe your thoughts on the general environment. We\u2019ve seen commentary around maybe a moderating macro longer-term on the other hand that continues to be some optimism around housing growth, but maybe, Dave, if you could sort of tell us how you\u2019re seeing the picture these days and maybe the sustainability some of this very impressive growth that you\u2019re seeing?", "David Steiner", "Yes, we obviously can\u2019t look out a number of years, but we said very often that the best indicator for our business is new housing starts. And as you know, we\u2019ve been running a deficit on new housing starts in the United States since 2009. So, we still haven\u2019t gotten to the point where we\u2019re meeting annual demand for new housing start. So, everything I\u2019ve seen, says that\u2019s going to continue to be strong through 2020. Now, obviously, you saw there are some labor challenges in the housing markets, but once those get evened out, I think you\u2019re going to start to see those new housing starts move up from that 1.1 to 1.2 to sort of a 1.4 million to 1.5 million. And you can run at that rate for a good three years to four years before you actually catch up with demand.", "So, and following those new housing start, you\u2019ll see commercial businesses come in. So, we see the commercial business remaining strong. And then I think, our other lines of business like our industrial and our oil field services, I think oil field services has bottomed out. We should see a recovery, I don\u2019t think that will be a huge robust recovery in 2017. But I think, we\u2019ll see a good steady recovery over the next couple of years. So, absent any big political event or big regulatory event, I would expect that we\u2019ll continue to see good volume growth over the next few years.", "Jim Fish", "Now, I might add one thing and that is, well, it's sometimes hard to see what the microeconomic climate holds. Demographics are kind of set in stone, and when you look at housing starts as David talked about, you\u2019ve got a big generation that kind of Millennial Generation, that\u2019s coming into their own in terms of moving out of parent homes and buying their own houses. So, we feel pretty good about that housing start, which is a direct correlate for us going forward for us for next 5 year to 10 years.", "Noah Kaye", "Getting the churn rate down to a slowest level, and over a decade, again very impressive, can you go further from here and where do you see it delivers, continue to drive churn rate lower at this point? And also, how do you think about some of the pricing stickiness benefits of the churn rates being at this level now?", "Jim Fish", "Yes, our pricing programs quite frankly have always been premised on providing better customer service. I always use the cable model, right. We all get an offer to get lower cable or lower TV service, once a week. We will get something that will promise us a lower price, but we don\u2019t switch because the pain in switching is high, and the cost differential is not dramatic. So, you got to keep that good customer service because you don\u2019t change TV provider until you start having service issues, and that\u2019s when you take those lower price offers, and you say, I\u2019m going to listen to these and actually get this done. And so, customer service is pivotal to the long-term sustainability of our pricing programs. And I would say, it\u2019s two things that really driving. One is technology. I mean, in use of technology, the use of data, and I would tell you in that we\u2019re probably in sort of the second to third inning.", "But the more important part of customer service is making sure that our customer service folks, our sales folks and our operations folks are all working hand-in-hand to make sure that we give a great customer experience. And frankly that\u2019s where we've made a lot of progress over the last two year. Jim Trevathan and his team have done a phenomenal job of creating better connections between our sales folks, our customer service folks and our operations folks to make sure that we\u2019re all driving to that same goal. So, yes, it can go lower, a probably about 4% to 5% of that churn is systemic, people going out of business, moving business different thinks like that. But we think we can continue to get it lower and we expect to do so.", "Jim Trevathan", "With a couple of specific examples of that, Jim Fish and I listed with our national account team last week. And we rolled out in the last year, a very specific tools that helps us provide for our largest customers, some online and a real-time information that helps them manage their business more aggressively. And it's led us as Dave and Jim mentioned in earlier, it's led us grow national account revenue in total this year, where that\u2019s been a negative drag of our volume in previous years. So, we\u2019re trying to differentiate that service offering very specifically. The other thing, without getting into any specific metrics; and it ties to exactly what Dave said, we\u2019ve added some operating metrics that tie directly to service to our customers, rather than just add internal efficiency look. And that's really helped us focusing the right think, we think add that specific value. And I guess, the last thing I have mentioned there is that, that we've gotten much more aggressive in the process that how we handle service challenges with our customers. Occasionally, we fell and when we do, we want to correct it quickly and adequately. But we also want to make sure that we renew contracts, every opportunity we get, so we\u2019ve added several process changes that led us renew those agreements once an issue, either positive or negative happened. And I think, it\u2019s added to that decreasing churn number.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with Credit Suisse.", "Andrew Buscaglia", "Can you talk a little bit more about, on the volume side, so that definitely was stronger than we expected, I thought moving into the second half of the year, you guys would see more it like flatter up slightly number, but can you talk about why -- where are the things surprised you obviously C&D was pretty strong, but what exactly happened and how surprised were you with these numbers?", "Jim Fish", "Well, look, I think the trend has been there now for about five quarters. So, I would tell you the move up in the volume number was not surprising at all. What I would tell you is, where we've made the most progress, I would say is on the commercial line. We finally flipped last quarter the commercial line to positive volume, and those are the customers that stay with you on average somewhere between 7 and 9 years. And so, they are long-term customers, we can create that route density. And so adding that 1.2% volume on the commercial line, I think is tremendous. I wouldn't say, surprised, but I would say that, that we're happy to see the landfill continue to be so robust. And it really doesn't look like that's going to slow down dramatically. Now, we may not continue to see that 22% on the C&D line, but we fully expect to continue to see sort of that 4% to 7% increase in the landfill. We don't see that's slowing down, and so we've created some good volume momentum, and we'd expect that to continue in the '17.", "Jim Trevathan", "And I don't think you can overstate also the importance of that chart number that, Jim, just talked about. I mean, when our churn is at 8.7% and it wasn't too long ago that we were in the 11s, that is a big contributor, and it comes as Jim said largely from our focus on customer service which doesn't cause you to lose yield. You keep a good solid customer through improved customer service.", "David Steiner", "Yes, Jim, the addition rate itself we talked more about the defection side, but on the addition side, we were up 50 basis points there, providing another quarter that was net positive in number of customers, not just dollars.", "Andrew Buscaglia", "And your C&D seemed to have benefited, you mentioned, the Louisiana some work down there, how about in Q4 with storm cleanup from Hurricane Matthew, do you expect volumes to just kind of continue at this level here?", "Jim Trevathan", "Yes, like any big storm event, the initial issue is that we've increased operating costs. We were actually as a company hit particularly hard by the flooding from the hurricane, we lost probably 20 brand new CNG trucks that were flooded out. And so, we have to move other trucks in, to cover for those trucks, and so the initial will actually be a cost for us. But obviously, you'll see some additional volumes, but it really was not a hurricane that hit in very populated areas and that caused lot of damage in populated areas. And so, if I had to guess, I would say it would be about a wash for the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Al Kaschalk of Wedbush Securities.", "Al Kaschalk", "So, performance, David, I want to just drill down on two topics. First, on the volume side, you called out the special waste piece, and if I'm not mistaken that's really more fly ash directed. So, could you talk about maybe the duration of that and what it means more for your broader outlook as it moves to volume? I know you\u2019ve said a few things earlier, but is this more a comment that there is reacceleration in the economy from your perspective, and therefore, this landfill and transfer volumes revenue should be continue to remain strong for couple of quarters.", "Jim Trevathan", "Yes, the ash is actually a very small part right around 10%.", "David Steiner", "Less than that.", "Jim Trevathan", "It's a special waste, so it\u2019s really a pretty small part. But, we continue to see good growth in that area, and we expect to continue to see good growth in that area. As far as special waste goes, my view of it, Al, is that we never really saw the industrial slowdown. And I think, people talk about an industrial slowdown and they focus on a particular sector like, my focus on the automobile sector, they might focus on the housing sector and they might focus on a particular sector and say, well gee, that shows that there\u2019s an industrial slowdown. We cover all the sectors and we service all of the sectors, and we really just haven\u2019t seen when you look at it on that basis with all of the industrial business, we really haven\u2019t seen the slowdown. So, we\u2019ll see a slowdown maybe in the oil field sector, but we\u2019ll see a picked up in the chemical corridor. And so, overall, we really haven\u2019t seen the industrial slowdown, and we don\u2019t see it on the near horizon.", "David Steiner", "And I'd say, but there is no --", "Jim Trevathan", "I was going to say, Al, part of that answer is because we're well distributed with our asset based across so many geographic areas, but also as Dave said, specific industries, we are so well positioned along the Gulf Coast with all of the capital being spent to improve petrochemical industry that we picked up quite a bit of volume, those hazardous sites along the Gulf Coast while other places show maybe a little bit weakness and that\u2019s the strength of our company.", "Al Kaschalk", "I would have thought with the government spending, the election, housing sort of shaking around a little bit, mix data here, that the volume would not have been as strong. Although, look, I\u2019m not taking anything away, I\u2019m just trying to tease out the duration of the tenure of what you see it looks like to be 2% volume growth for the next several quarters. So, that\u2019s sort of that one the setting out.", "David Steiner", "Yes, we just don\u2019t see -- at this point in time, we certainly don\u2019t see that momentum stopping.", "Jim Trevathan", "Well, actually, Al, a piece that's been a week for us has been energy services, and we\u2019re starting to see -- starting to hear a little bit from drillers that they may be looking to add capital expenditures in drilling, in 2017. So, we\u2019re not banking on that, but that would be a benefit to us in the landfill.", "Al Kaschalk", "Okay. My second follow-up, if I may. I wanted to talk a little bit, I know, it was 23 million in terms of cost for the quarter. But just on a bigger pictures standpoint, the leachate cost seems to maybe something that\u2019s maybe going to stick with you for a while. But maybe you can add some color as to how broad base that is, is it just a few sides? Is it regional? Is there weather issues that are going on? What\u2019s the future expense that we should be thinking about?", "David Steiner", "Yes. I would say that it\u2019s obviously two factors, the volume of leachate and then the cost of disposal of the leachate, right. And there is not a lot we can do about the volume of the leachate. When it rains, we get more leachate. But there is something that we can do, on the disposal side, and that is the bigger part of that $23 million of expense, is disposal side. So we\u2019re building waste water treatment plants, we\u2019re going to look at doing some deep well injection at various sides and so. If we can reduce that disposal cost, we think we can bring that cost down pretty dramatically. Now, that takes a little bit of a time, so we would expect these increase leachate cost to be with us at least through mid-year of next year and probably throughout 2017. But in 2018, we ought to be able to attack it pretty well.", "Jim Trevathan", "Now, I would say that it is, someone regional, but we\u2019ve seen an increase in transportation, not just in kind of East Coast, Mid Atlantic and doing one, we\u2019ve seen it in Michigan area, we seen it in Texas, not obviously so much on the West Coast. And I don\u2019t think you guys have rained there for couple of years. So, we haven\u2019t seen much in the West or the Rocky Mountains, but defiantly the rest of the country has seen an increase, not only in volume but in transportation cost.", "Al Kaschalk", "I appreciate all the colors. Are there any one or two sides that, I don't say are problem child, but could be or are working that way there?", "David Steiner", "The biggest issue we had was in Virginia, when we got, basically, we were transporting the leachate to a water treatment facility, municipal water treatment facility of the PLTW. And they shut off the leachate, not just from our landfill but from all landfills. And so, it\u2019s not an issue that is unique to us. We just happen to have too large landfills fairly close to that PLTW. And so -- and by the way that\u2019s happening a little bit more throughout the country, I wouldn\u2019t say, it\u2019s a trend, but that\u2019s the biggest part of what\u2019s driven our transportation cost. Now, instead of transporting it to a local PLTW, we got to put it on trucks and barges, and ship it 100 of miles. And so, if we can build the waste water treatment facility on site, obviously, you eliminate that transportation cost, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital.", "Hamzah Mazari", "The first question is just on free cash flow, is 1.6 billion to 1.7 billion the new normal for Waste Management, 5 to 10 years and ago was 1.1 billion. Just trying to get a sense of, is the free cash flow profile sustainable, given that data, features don\u2019t seem like a big part of the number at least this quarter?", "Jim Fish", "Yes, Hamzah, as you recall back a couple of quarters ago, we kind of set the new normal was 1.4 and it feels like that number is going out and it feels like more or like a 1.5. If you look at, kind how to get to our range of 1.6 to 1.7 for this year, I kind walk you through little bit of it. But most of it comes from the single biggest component, which is EBITDA, which is in my mind kind of the best proxy for how the business is doing overall. So, if we think about finishing 2016 with about 365 in the EBITDA, and then you back out CapEx kind of the middle of that range, so that I give it on earlier. So back out CapEx of 1.425 billion last kind of the some of the interest taxes and working capital of about 650 million.", "And then you added proceeds, and you\u2019re right proceeds are kind a small number this year compared to prior years. But adding proceeds of about 50 million, and that puts you at about 1625 finishing point for 2016. And then in order to get to kind of a new normal, you probably have to kind of normalize cash taxes a bit. We haven't decided exactly what we're going to do. But for the last two years we've actually prepaid some cash taxes, two years ago, we prepaid 200 million. And last year, we prepaid a 150 million. And as we said when we did it, it was really an effort to try and kind of smooth out cash flows a bit, so we don't have these big lumps. But, we'll look at that as we get to the end of year and to the extent that we're kind of over the top of that low end of the range, maybe look to prepay some cash taxes in December.", "Jim Trevathan", "So, Hamzah, I would completely agree with Jim that I think, I think the business is about a $1.5 billion free cash flow business, I think that's sort of baseline. And then you look at what happens with working capital, right. If working capital goes positive, this year it goes positive because of the prepayments that's how you get to about 1.6 to 1.7. And so, I would say that I'd agree with Jim, the baseline is sort of 1.5 and then you have a couple of other moving items within working capital that could drive it above that.", "Hamzah Mazari", "And then second question on commercial volume, we saw a nice recovery there. But aside from the last two, three quarters, it's been negative since 2008. And I realize that you've been getting rid of low margin business, but maybe just frame for us where we in that commercial volume cycle -- is it the second inning, the third inning? And can commercial see the same cycle industrial volumes have, just curious on any thoughts there?", "David Steiner", "Yes, I would tell you, Hamzah that I think we're in the early inning, still. I talked earlier about housing starts and how housings starts are, the demand is there. The problem right now is that it's hard for the housing companies to get labor. And I would say that's sort of where we are in this cycle, right, that the demand is there. But getting drivers, mechanics, getting the labor, getting the trucks in place, is something that we've got to work to be able to meet the demand. And so, I'm encouraged that I think we're in the early innings because the demand is there. Now, it's a matter of us getting the labor and the equipment there to meet the demand. But, I'll let Jim.", "Jim Trevathan", "Completely, agree Dave, it's been a little more of a challenge, you saw that, little bit of the compression in the operating margin. Although, with move forward, it was smaller than previous quarters, and we think that's primarily related to some new route trucks that were not routed before, we've spent a few dollars in maintenance costs to get them up and running and servicing customers correctly. And it's a good problem to have that we see continuing but we're getting our arms around how to do that quicker and faster and better as that volume is forward. And I think, I mean the economy, that's kind of late cycle economy that I've read, you all have talked about. It's definitely is helping volumes. And then I think our process in some of the additions that we've made on how we go out and find that volume. We're targeting volume especially on the commercial side, but also industrial, much more specifically to MSAs that have growth and where do we put the right resources in place, both human and physical resources in place, how do we target it correctly, price it correctly. And those tools have been out there, we're just using them much more consistently across all areas, sharing best practices and you're starting to see the benefit of that.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Michael Feniger with Bank of America.", "Michael Feniger", "If we\u2019re in a 1.5% to 2% volume growth next year, what can we reasonably expect for margin expansion? Is it just still work to do, I know, we have leachate cost, but still other areas that we could look at for the cost item that we can make sure that we can get margin expansion?", "Jim Fish", "Yes, when you look at the margin expansion, I think that we still have that 50 to 100 basis point. So, when we look at 2017, we will probably expect to not get a big benefit from recycling even though we think commodity prices are up. We\u2019ve been bitten by that before, so when we put together our plan we probably won\u2019t expect to get a large benefit from recycling. So, that won\u2019t contribute the margin. Obviously, we\u2019ve got this leachate expense which will restrain the margin. But what we need to do is get efficiency gains by adding route density, we need to get more dollars of price as we see the construction season beginning next year and we need to do I think a better job of planning for the construction season and meeting the increase demand that we would expect to see. And to meet that what\u2019s going to drive the margin, obviously, the Jims and our other operations folks keep a great eye on SG&A. And as you see revenue go up, obviously, we pick up basis point there because we\u2019ll hold SG&A relatively flat. And so I think that 50 to 100 basis points of margin expansion next year, so to come probably 40% from SG&A and about 60% from the operating side.", "Michael Feniger", "That\u2019s perfect guys. And my follow up, if we do see volumes come out a little bit late next year. Is there any way to move in towards or maybe stepping up the acquisition side or situations you guys talk about the pipeline there and what are you\u2019re seeing on the M&A front?", "Jim Trevathan", "Yes, the last three years, we've sort of done that $50 million to $70 million EBITDA acquisition starting with RCI in Canada and then Deffenbaugh in Kansas City and then SWS in South Florida. And we really don\u2019t see, one of those types of acquisitions in the pipeline for 2017. So, we\u2019re going to have to go back have to doing it one acquisition at a time doing those $5 million to $25 million type of acquisitions and get our business developers to really go out and start getting some folks to build up those types of acquisitions, so that we can reach. We like to add somewhere between $25 million and $40 million of EBITDA next year, but we\u2019ve got some work to do in order to get that done.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Corey Grindal with First Analysis.", "Corey Grindal", "So, just looking at yield being a little bit softer in Q3 relative to Q2, just wondering what do you attribute this to and what do you see as the sustainable rate going into 2017?", "Jim Trevathan", "Yes. As you know we\u2019ve always said, we think that yield should be somewhere around 2%. The overall company was 2.6%, we actually got some positive from recycling and some other areas where we've sort of been negative lately. So, it\u2019s pretty much right where we expected to be now, we moved that in the back half of the year. And I think we said on the first two quarter conference call that, that it would probably abate in the second half for the year, between CPI and mix that we would see it come down closely to about 2. But you know when I look at -- when I look at pricing increasingly, we\u2019re looking at core price, not yield, because yield has those mix issue in it. Yield has some of the CPI issues in it. But core price is the actually dollar that we\u2019re putting on the street and holding onto in pricing. And as you saw, that was up 70 basis points this quarter. What we said as that we think core price should be sort of at that 4% number year-in and year-out. We would expect that to continue. And so, we continue to get that 4% plus core price, yield should continue at around 2%. But we\u2019re going to get too worked up over a few basis points of moment here or there based on CPI or on mix.", "Corey Grindal", "And just looking at commodity prices, which have been on an upward trajectory, what kind of impact are you expecting for your recycling revenue over the next few quarters? And does this have any impact on your efforts to change contracts?", "Jim Trevathan", "No, I mean, look, we got to get -- you can\u2019t fall into the trap of saying, no, prices are going up, so let's go back to the old style of doing business in recycling. We absolutely will never do that as long as I\u2019m breathing. And so, it won\u2019t affect our contracts, it will affect -- we will continue to readout those contracts that are under the old form. And basically, we\u2019re about 80% through with that. When you look at the pricing, it\u2019s up, but it\u2019s not dramatically up. And it\u2019s been fairly volatile over the last few years, so we\u2019re not declaring victory, we\u2019re going to continue to go after all the operating cost that we can on the recycling side. And like I said, we won\u2019t expect to get a benefit from it, in 2017. But if we get a benefit that will help to offset some of those increased leachate cost.", "Jim Fish", "Now, we\u2019re finished when you think about were we -- to put its historical prospective, we finished the quarter about $98 in our average commodity price for us. And the 10-year historical average is kind of 103ish. So, still slightly below that, and as David has said, we've fallen into the trap before of some saying we think this trend continues and we'll build it into the guidance for 2017. At this point we, while we haven\u2019t put the guidance, we\u2019re not probably not going to set high expectations for commodity prices for 2017.", "Corey Grindal", "Thank you.", "Jim Trevathan", "And by the way to the volume issue, because I think you did ask about the volume too. Most of the increase that we saw and we did see a positive volume in the quarter, but most of that volume was brokerage volume, which obviously is very low margin volume. When you look at the core processing business, as you know we've shed a lot of unprofitable contracts over the last three years. And so the core business is still seeing some negative volume on the recycling side, but we had really strong brokerage volume.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital.", "Joe Box", "David, if I heard you right, I think you said, you're looking for about 50 to 100 basis points of margin expansion next year. And I think you called out 40% of that being SG&A and 60% being operating, maybe if you can drill into the SG&A, which it was basically at the lowest level that I could find in my model going back to at least 2003. When you look at that going forward, are there any big items that you expect to cut out SG&A? Or is this more a function of just watching your costs and getting good leverage on that revenue growth?", "David Steiner", "I do think it is, it is watching the costs. And the Jims and the operating folks have done a spectacular job of keeping SG&A flat despite the fact we gave a 2.5% to 3% merit increase, every year. So, they've done a nice job of keeping the dollars flat. And then, if the revenue goes up, that's where you get the expansion. And look, we've always said, if we can start putting volume onto this sort of high fixed cost structure that we have, that's how we generate margin expansion. And we feel like we've got the right level of SG&A in order to meet the needs of the business whether it's in today's environment or in next year's environment where we see the volumes go -- continuing to go up. And so, we don't think that we're going to have to add a lot of dollars of SG&A. We've done a nice job on SG&A over the last five years of taking out costs, I would tell you there's not any big dramatic decrease in SG&A. It's just a matter of making sure that you're not adding people that you don't have to add. That you're not adding expenses that you don't have to add. And Jim and the operating guys do a spectacular job of looking at every dollar of SG&A we spend and making sure that it's justified.", "Joe Box", "And maybe just switching gears to the coal ash side, can you maybe talk about what the coal ash contribution was in the quarter, either from a revenue or volume standpoint, where are you putting that? Is that primarily in the special waste bucket? And I'd be curious to know, how the margin is coming in for coal ash, if it's accretive to the overall margin or if it's dilutive?", "David Steiner", "Yes, Joe, overall as we said earlier on the call, coal ash, the disposal portion, flows into the special waste revenue generating cover category, and that was up almost 7%. The coal ash part is less than 10% of that total, so it's still a small part of our overall revenue but a growing component of our revenue. We also have some onsite activities. We've done work on those customer sides where we're moving materials from one location to another, helping them operationally manage both their generated waste materials, but also their historic materials that are stockpiled and need remediation. So, there's an onsite component. That onsite component is without a doubt a lower margin. It is accretive to our company. But it also -- it has a very low capital costs associated with it. The disposal side, much higher margin and when we go off site, higher margin. But it's typical to our landfill margins. So, it is a good part of our business but it's not a substantial part yet, Joe. But we expect it to be over the coming years to continue to grow as those regulations take effect. And companies decide what they're going to do on their site to meet those new regulations.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Michael Hoffman with Stifel.", "Michael Hoffman", "So, Jim first on, SG&A you started the year targeting a flat year-over-year in dollars. To do that, you would actually be down again in 4Q, is that still the right trend in dollars?", "Jim Fish", "I think for Q4, it'll probably look a little bit look like a first half for the year, but the goal is always as it is, when we talked about 2017 planning right now to try and hold flat in dollars and then get the benefit as revenue increases. I think, Q4 will probably a little bit more like the first half of the year than the Q3 itself.", "Michael Hoffman", "In percentages or dollars?", "Jim Fish", "Percentages.", "Michael Hoffman", "Percentages, okay. So, the midpoint of that sort of 10 points --", "Jim Fish", "Yes, let say this, not in the absolute percentages, but in percent of revenue versus prior year. So, we were -- for first half of the year, we were basically flat on a percent of revenue basis. We were up a little bit in dollars. And a lot of that came from the increase in our stock based compensation, the accruals for our stock based compensation programs, which driven obviously by total shareholder return and then also free cash flow. And those two metrics have done well, so as a result, we've had increased the accruals there. So, I think you may see that again in Q4, which would mean that as a percent of revenue in Q4 versus prior year will probably be about flat, dollars maybe up again.", "Michael Hoffman", "Right, okay. Well, definitely up a bit, so that puts up for the year. Okay, that helps there. So then, to get to your revised guidance on earnings, which suggests that the gross margin in the fourth quarter has to improve. So while you had gross margins weak a little bit sequentially, this is a sequential issue, and you noted a leachate issue, I\u2019m hearing there is some maybe gross margin improvement that\u2019s to come in the fourth quarter in order to be able to hit that 291 or better number?", "Jim Trevathan", "You've also got the volume improvement continuing in the fourth quarter.", "Michael Hoffman", "Yes, I mean, that\u2019s the operating leverage into the gross margin is what I\u2019m assuming, is that volume improvement, is going to help drive gross margin improvement in the third quarter and fourth quarter?", "Jim Trevathan", "It's absolutely correct.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. So, it would be realistic to assume gross margins to be better in the fourth quarter than they were in the third quarter?", "Jim Trevathan", "Yes, absolute.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. And then with regards to the volume, but let me ask some questions on churn first and then the operating leverage. Given if you were to run all next year at the same rate of churn, I would think that you are reported price that yield number trends up by definition because you\u2019re not replacing as much business as lower rates, so that four point something core price you\u2019re keeping more of it. That\u2019s part of the answer of why you\u2019re able to do two percentages is because you're structurally going to have a whole year of lower churn?", "Jim Trevathan", "Now, that's exactly right. And when youlookatthe effect of new business pricing, lost business pricing, you\u2019re exactly right. If we can have less lost business, that drops straight to the yield number.", "Michael Hoffman", "Got it. Okay. All right. So that\u2019s the support for that pricing. And then, Jim Fish, on working capital. Do we get some help on working capital on the fourth quarter to the free cash? Should that be a pass -- you\u2019ll get -- you collect more your bills?", "James Fish", "We do get a little bit of help from working capital in Q4.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. And then, David, you started talking about industrial activity, I think Jim Trevathan use it too, and then you didn't quite close a loop on it. I mean, clearly, the industrial economy is slow, that\u2019s not disputable. But you\u2019re not seeing incremental deterioration, it\u2019s slow to a now sustained rate of a lower rate of growth, and you\u2019re not seeing any future duration?", "David Steiner", "No, I'd agree with that. And last time I saw the numbers, they are still above 50. So, we\u2019re still seeing a little bit of industrial growth.", "Michael Hoffman", "Yes, it\u2019s just that of smaller rate of growth and everybody had been, and folks we\u2019re looking for 3% and 4% industrial traction growth. Starting near, we\u2019re really sort in a 1 to 2. So, it\u2019s a long-term low growth rate?", "David Steiner", "No, I'd agree with that.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. And then on free cash flow, all things have been equal, we would be -- it would be down year-over-year because of the cash tax issue and then grow that numbers. I mean that\u2019s the common of the base line of 1.45 billion to 1.5 billion and grow that number summary. Is it right way to think because the noise of cash taxes?", "Jim Fish", "That\u2019s right, Michal, I mean there is two things really that are potential headwinds for us, and then we overcome those with growth of the business. Those two things as you mentioned, one is cash tax and the other is CapEx. And right now looks like, CapEx for 2017 could be higher. We've had a couple of projects that we originally had in 2016, that\u2019s why our range is come down a little bit. We were originally 1.4 to 1.5. We\u2019re now 1.4 to 1.45. So, we brought the top end at the right side by $50 million that\u2019s just simply because the government projects that we had originally thought would show off in 2016. Look like, they will show up in 2017. So, none of it is, do we feel like we can\u2019t overcome, but those are two things that work again in little bit 2017.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. And I was going to sort of tease on that, given the strength of volume, do we see the mix of CapEx or may be move a little bit to help this tax issue to which is pull forwards and trucks and containers, get them in service before the end of the year and capture the bonus depreciation?", "Jim Fish", "So, Jim and I have kind of managed the capital committee, pretty along those lines. And we look at bonus depreciation and we look at, how do, kind of smooth CapEx a little bit. And so, as we think about CapEx, so really may be to answer your question this way, we set along that we thought CapEx should fall in the 9% to 10% of revenue range. In 2014, it was below that, it was in the 8%. 2015, it was just about 9 like 9.1. And 2016.it's going to closer to 10, but we still think in 2017 and on a go forward basis, that range of 9% to 10% is the healthy range, it\u2019s a good range for us. Keep in mind; if you look at things like leach repurchases in 2012, 2013, I think in 2012 we bought around 900 to 950 vehicles. We\u2019re going to buy 1300 vehicles this year. So when we think about OpEx and we talked about it earlier, eventually that has to start affecting our maintenance cost, as we increase the numbers, trucks that we buy by almost 40%. Hopefully that answers your question.", "Jim Trevathan", "Yes, Michael, I just add one other thing, although we have the last few years moved few dollars to capital into the current year. The one thing that Jim and I are certainly focused on and that's making sure, we support the business and the growth. We\u2019re not doing that other than to support growth where can we have value by moving trucks forward or backward or any other capital projects. It's got to align with where the opportunity is and how we want to grow our business.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay.", "Jim Trevathan", "Produce in order -- we've talked about as look, talking to individual area of managers and Vice President's and say look, here's what your capital request has done over the last three years. And here's what your earnings have done. So, when we think about return on invested capital maybe you're doing well, maybe you're not. But we're having those individual conversations.", "Michael Hoffman", "And then last question on volume. So lots of hand-wringing in the last month about data regarding the consumer and economy, if you look into your database and start looking at very consumer-centric businesses is strong especially retail. My sense is based on the MSW trends and then landfill volume trends in MSW, that consumer is still plodding along there and you haven't seen any pullback in activity. They're participating in the economy and then restaurants maybe complaining about having many cut price and do all that, that's a fundamental issue for them, it's not that consumer starts shopping?", "Jim Trevathan", "I completely agree with that. We've seen to you point in the restaurant sector we've seen waste come down slightly. But we haven't seen service levels change, so we continue to service increases outpace service decreases. And for us, that's really sort of on the commercial side that's the leading indicator that we look at and we still see that very strong.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Tony Bancroft with Gabelli & Company.", "Tony Bancroft", "Real quick, just give us update on the Waste CPI transition and progress there?", "David Steiner", "Yes, as we look at it I think the number that we've always said is about 25% to 35% of our customers are on some type of modified index, whether it's a particularized index for us or a government index like the waste water and sewage. That\u2019s one where like a lot of things we do. You have to have sort of an industry backing, right. I mean, look too many times we see -- I'll go back to the recycling business, too many times we saw a lot of people bid rational contracts like we do and then one party comes in and says we'll do it under the old type of contract and before you know it they're winning business and losing money. And I would tell you, we haven't seen as much sort of industry acceptance of a different CPI based residential or franchise type model.", "We've not seen widespread enough acceptance to move the needle, I mean when competitors go and say we're going to bid on a modified CPI and then the fourth bidder comes in and says we'll take whatever you have on the table. It's hard to see things change. And so we've had better success in our large franchise areas like California but I think that's going to be a long slow slug that we just have -- we have to as -- there's only thing we can do at Waste Management, and that's stiffing our backbone and say, we're not going to bid these contracts when it's not good for our business. We've proven that on the recycling side. We need to continue to have that different type of firm backbone on the residential and franchise side.", "Jim Trevathan", "And Tony, you\u2019ve seen that our residential volume is stay negative is that we have loss of volume, but we look at it as Dave said, on the long-term basis or return on invested capital. There is just real focus and we just not going to take business long-term, it doesn\u2019t give us the ability to manage our cost structure and also get some margin improvement.", "Tony Bancroft", "And I know you mentioned in the call bottoming up you\u2019re and if you potentially I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate obviously a little rates have been up. And recently, anything you\u2019re seeing as far as in your line of business right now?", "David Steiner", "Yes. The last report I saw which was last week I think showed rig counts across the U.S and the shale plays up 11, which is very small on a percentage basis. And the majority of those were in the Permian Basin where we don\u2019t have a presence. But, we are starting to see a little bit of indication that maybe some of those shale place where we do have a presence or thinking about drilling next year which is a change from the past two years for sure.", "Tony Bancroft", "Right.", "Jim Trevathan", "But, Tony, in real business, we\u2019re still down versus the prior year or getting closer to that reduction but it still not in close to the previous level and without significant movement forward. But we see some signs of it.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no questions.", "David Steiner", "Well, thank you for joining us as we move into the holiday season. We wish all the best as we move towards the end of the year. And hopefully everyone on the phone will have to spend time with the families and live what the holidays are about. So, we\u2019ll see you when we release next quarter. Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference.

I'm opening on a somber note this quarter as we bid farewell to our Chairman, Bob Reum, who passed away last week after a brief but valiant battle with cancer. Bob brought a strategic sense and a naturally inquisitive approach to leading the Waste Management board and his intellect and guidance will be missed by me and by all who worked with him. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Sherry and his three children, Carson, Courtney and Halley. They've lost a wonderful husband and father, and we've lost a good friend. Thank you for joining me in a brief moment of silence for Bob. Thank you.", "On a much lighter note, my friend David Steiner completed a very successful and transformational career on Waste Management last year. Among many things that David brought to Waste Management including driving tremendous value through disciplined pricing, our recently completed 2017 Waste Management Phoenix Open was his brainchild. In fact, he played in our first Waste Management Pro-Am with a guy who would later become a good friend of his, Phil Mickelson. While he played with Phil before, Phil plays in lots of Pro-Ams and didn't remember David until David uncorked his infamous swing on the first tee, to which Phil said, now I remember you. Thank you, David, for your great contribution and your many years of service to Waste Management and we wish you well with that swing and all of your future endeavors.", "Now moving on to results: 2016 was a very successful year as we exceeded expectations across the board. Each of our operating income, operating EBITDA and net cash provided by our operating activities were at all-time highs and each showed the greatest year-over-year percentage and absolute improvements in the last decade. In addition, earnings per diluted share, operating income margin and operating EBITDA margin were the best we've seen since the merger in 1998.", "Our commitment to improving core price, adding profitable volume in a disciplined manner and controlling costs produced $2.91 of EPS, just as we forecasted when we raised our full-year guidance at the end of the third quarter, that was an increase of 11.5% compared to 2015. We've built a strong foundation and have the momentum to continue to generate growth into 2017. During 2016, our strong free cash flow allowed us to return almost $1.5 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases.", "We've seen solid growth in the cash generation capability of our business over the last few years, and as a result of their confidence and continued strong cash flow, our board has stated its intention to increase the dividends declared in 2017 by 3.7% and has authorized up to $750 million of share repurchases. Over and above our dividend, our preference is to use our free cash flow to acquire accretive businesses at a reasonable purchase price, so the amount and timing of share repurchases is dependent upon the acquisition landscape.", "For the full-year, revenues increased almost $650 million, or 5%. This is the best revenue growth we've had since 2011. One of the drivers of our success in 2016 was the continued improvement in our pricing programs. For the full-year, our collection and disposal core price was 5% with yield of 2.4%, both exceeded our original expectations for the year with each individual line of business improving over 2015. For the fourth quarter, core price was 5.1% and yield was 2.1%.", "Looking at volumes, our traditional solid waste volumes were positive 1.6% in 2016, a 210-basis-point improvement from 2015. And our overall volume was a positive 1.4%, an increase of 300 basis points year-over-year. 2016 demonstrated that we can maintain pricing discipline and grow high-margin volumes, while delivering exceptional customer service. Our employees are focused on continuing to progress we've made here.", "With regard to recycling, we talked to you last year about the transformation we were initiating to ensure that this line of business is both environmentally and economically sustainable for the long term. In 2016, we made significant progress on that front by improving operating costs and renegotiating contractual terms with our customers as the recycling line of business contributed $0.09 of EPS year-over-year. Our recycling employees have worked hard to change the business model to ensure we generate returns our shareholders expect whether commodity prices are high or low. Our contract terms are now designed to recover processing costs and fully charged for contamination. We're fully committed to providing the recycling services our customers' desired at the returns our shareholders expect.", "I will now turn the call over to Jim and Devina to discuss our fourth quarter results in more detail, and then I will conclude with a discussion of our strategy and our 2017 guidance.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Thanks, Jim, and good morning. The fourth quarter of 2016 saw a continuation of a strong operating and financial results we saw throughout the year. Revenues in the quarter were $3.46 billion, an increase of $214 million, or 6.6% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Once again, our revenue growth was driven by the successful execution of our price, customer service, disciplined growth strategies in our collection and disposal business.", "Fourth quarter revenue growth in our collection and disposal business from the combined impact of price and volume was $118 million. Fourth quarter revenues also benefited from higher recycling commodity prices, which drove a $51-million increase in recycling revenues. Acquisitions, net of divestitures also increased revenues for the quarter by $45 million. Fuel surcharges and foreign currency fluctuations did not significantly impact our revenue for the quarter.", "Looking at internal revenue growth in the fourth quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 5.1% and yield was 2.1%, with total volumes improving 2% and traditional solid waste volumes improving 1.7%. We saw revenue growth from volume contribute equally to price growth for the first time in over five years, but without compromising our pricing strategy or results. We focused on improving service to our customers, and our full-year churn improved 100 basis points to 9.1%. This is the lowest churn rate since 2002 when we were at 8.6%.", "We also saw service increases, exceeding service decreases for the 12 consecutive quarter, supporting continued commercial volume growth. The combined positive price and positive volume led to total company income from operations growing $42 million. Operating income margin expanding 10 basis points to 17.8% and operating EBITDA growing $54 million. Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefits from improving price and now volumes.", "In the fourth quarter, commercial core price was 7.6% with volumes up 2%, which was a 270-basis-point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2015 and an 80-basis-point sequential improvement from the third quarter of 2016. Industrial core price was 9.7% with volume up 1% in the fourth quarter, while industrial collection volumes continue to improve, the rate of growth moderated when comparing the fourth quarter of 2016 with the prior-year period, which is largely due to the tougher comparisons in C&D volumes.", "In the residential line of business, core price was 2.7%, residential volumes were down 2.6% in the fourth quarter, which is the same rate of decline as the fourth quarter of 2015, and a 30-basis-point sequential improvement from the third quarter of 2016. Our focus is on disciplined pricing of the business to ensure an acceptable return on invested capital. The combined price and volume in our collection line of business led to income from operations growing almost $19 million and operating EBITDA growing $30 million.", "In the landfill line of business, we again saw the benefits of positive volume and positive yield in the fourth quarter. Total landfill volumes increased 6.2%, with MSW volumes growing 1.6%, C&D volume grew 17.7%, and combined special waste and revenue-generating cover volumes grew 7.1%. We achieved core price of 2.5%, about the same as the fourth quarter of 2015.", "As Jim mentioned, we made significant progress improving the recycling line of business, which contributed $0.09 of EPS year-over-year. The majority of the increase in EPS, or $0.065 was driven by improvements in operating cost and renegotiating contract terms. The remaining $0.025 was due to improved commodity prices. For the full year, gross operating expenses per ton improved by 2.4% and average commodity recycling prices at our recycling facilities improved 8.6% and volumes grew 0.8%.", "And moving now to operating expenses. In the fourth quarter, total operating cost increased $120 million when compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. The cost increases were largely related to our increased volumes and cost related to acquired operations, which were reflected in higher labor and subcontractor costs. We also saw increases in leachate cost and a 130 basis point impact from higher commodity-based cost related to recycling rebates and fuel expense.", "Our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved 30 basis points from 62.4% in the fourth quarter of 2015 to 62.1% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The improvement in operating expense margin from revenue growth, efficiency gains and cost control efforts was 160 basis points, but this margin improvement was largely offset by the commodity-based cost in the quarter.", "I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results.", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "Thanks, Jim, and good morning everyone. For the fourth quarter of 2016, as a percent of revenue, SG&A costs were 10.9%, which is an increase of 30 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2015. On the dollar basis, SG&A costs were $378 million in the fourth quarter, or $35 million higher than in the prior year period. The increased SG&A costs on both the margin and dollar basis are almost entirely related to higher costs for our incentive compensation plans, because we outperformed the goals set for the year. SG&A costs during the quarter also included a charge for executive severance costs, which negatively impacted EPS by $0.01 per share.", "So when we look at fourth quarter income from operations and operating EBITDA margin, the year-over-year comparison would have been 100 basis points better without the increase in these incentive compensation and severance costs.", "For the full year, we held our SG&A costs flat on a percent of revenue basis at 10.4% as we offset increased incentive compensation costs and higher SG&A costs from large acquisitions by reducing back office spend and finding greater efficiencies in our processes. We will continue to focus on our continuous improvement objectives and managing SG&A costs in the year to come and expect to hold SG&A costs flat in 2017 and for SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue to improve by about 40 basis points.", "Turning to cash flow. In the fourth quarter, cash provided by operating activities was $753 million compared to $526 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. This growth in operating cash flow was driven in part by an increase in operating EBITDA of $54 million, and this reflects the strength of our core operating performance in the year. For the full year, cash provided by operating activities increased $462 million to almost $3 billion. Again, operating EBITDA was the primary driver of the increase year-over-year, contributing $277 million of increased cash flow.", "During the fourth quarter, we spent $377 million on capital expenditures, and for the full year, we spent $1.34 billion, which is an increase of $106 million from 2015. When we gave our guidance for capital spending at the end of the third quarter, we expected to spend about $1.4 billion in 2016. Due to permit and construction delays that were beyond our control with three of our capital projects, we pushed $50 million of this spend from 2016 into 2017. This $50 million deferral is included in our 2017 projected capital expenditures, which Jim will discuss.", "So combined in the fourth quarter, we generated $387 million of free cash flow and this is a $199 million increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year, our free cash flow increased by $254 million, or 18% to $1.66 billion. This is the highest amount of free cash flow that the company has ever generated, if you exclude the proceeds from the divestiture of Wheelabrator in 2014.", "As I mentioned, in 2016, our free cash flow growth was driven by the 8.1% increase in operating EBITDA. While this bodes well for continued cash flow growth from core operations in the year to come, in 2017, we have some headwinds to overcome, but they're incorporated in our guidance that Jim is going to discuss. In 2016, we had a $67 million benefit from the termination of a cross currency hedge that will not repeat. We also expect cash taxes to increase, capital expenditures to be higher and our cash payout for incentive compensation to be up in 2017. That said, our focus in 2017 will not change. We will grow revenue and manage our costs, maintain capital spending discipline and drive efficiency and working capital to generate high and sustainable levels of free cash flow.", "In 2016, we continued our commitment to returning value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, returning a total of $1.45 billion during the year. In the fourth quarter, we paid $180 million in dividends to our shareholders, and we repurchased $225 million of our shares. For the full year, we paid $726 million in dividends and repurchased $725 million of our shares.", "During 2016, we allocated cash to capital investments for the organic growth of our business, acquired core solid waste businesses to enhance growth and return value to shareholders, all while maintaining a strong balance sheet.", "At the end of the fourth quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, measured based on our bank covenants, was 2.53. Our weighted-average cost of debt for the quarter was 4.17%, and the floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 14% at the end of the quarter. For 2017, we currently expect that interest expense and cash interest paid will be relatively flat with the full year of 2016.", "The effective tax rate was approximately 34.4% in the quarter. And on an as adjusted basis, the full-year tax rate was also 34.4%, which is in line with our expectations. We have built our 2017 projections using current tax law, and we currently expect our 2017 tax rate to be about 36.5%. The increase in our projected tax rate for 2017 is due to expectations for higher operating and pre-tax income, which reduces the benefit from our tax credit.", "I will now turn the call back over to Jim to discuss our strategic outlook and 2017 guidance.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Thanks, Devina. When we reflect on 2016, we're very pleased with our results. We successfully executed on our strategy of improving price, disciplined volume growth and controlling costs. Looking forward to 2017, we expect core price to be 4%, or greater and yield should be approximately 2%. We expect to achieve the same dollar amount of pricing in 2017 as we did in 2016, however, with the growth in our revenue and core pricing yield as a percent of revenue will moderate. We expect total company volumes to grow in the range of between 1.2% and 1.6% for the full year in 2017.", "We anticipate that we will lose some unprofitable recycling contracts in 2017 and that our 2016 landfill volume growth of more than 7.5% will moderate on tougher comparison with this year. In our recycling business, 2017 has seen a strong start to the year with current prices of our average commodity price per ton up $40 from the lows we experienced in January 2016.", "January of 2017's uptick over January of 2016 was driven primarily by strong cardboard pricing impacting our brokerage business. However, we're not forecasting that these elevated levels will be sustainable throughout 2017 and the comparisons in the back half of the year will become more difficult. But we still anticipate additional operating cost improvements. Add to that the strong commodity prices in Q1 and we expect a positive $0.03 impact on our EPS year-over-year when compared to 2016, with most of the contribution occurring in the first quarter of 2017.", "The real theme for our 2017 financial guidance is the continued strong operating EBITDA growth, which will be the foundation of our free cash flow. We expect that the solid execution of our strategic priorities will produce 2017 operating EBITDA growth of between 6.5% and 8%. This will lead to between $3.95 billion and $4 billion of operating EBITDA, and that will, in turn, drive free cash flow of between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion. The expected increase in capital spending is to fund truck and container purchases volume growth, the Los Angeles and New York City contract wins, and the $50 million carryover impact that Devina mentioned. Bottom line, we expect 2017 adjusted EPS of between $3.14 and $3.18 per share.", "Looking at the strategic drivers of 2017 and beyond, we will stay keenly focused on those tried and true earnings drivers including core price execution, disciplined volume growth, and controlling costs. In addition, we will stay focused on safely providing superior customer service, attracting and retaining the best team in the industry and differentiation through technology. From improving the ease of self-service for our customers through enhanced mobile applications to improving our pricing and routing tools, to working with our OEMs on advanced vehicle and container technologies, we will use technology to supplement our strategy and both drive growth in our business and further reduce costs. With strong execution on these strategic drivers combined with a continued focus on acquiring accretive businesses, we're confident that 2017 will be another great year for Waste Management.", "In summary, we had great success in 2016, driving earnings and cash flow growth to record levels that exceeded our own expectations. As we've demonstrated over the last few years, strong pricing, the execution of our service delivery optimization programs and growing the right kind of volume drive margin expansion. We expect that to continue into 2017. We did this as a team working together to execute upon our top strategic priorities. I'm honored to be able to take this opportunity to thank each member of the Waste Management team for this success. So, thank you. In 2016, you delivered exceptional service to our customers, and you look for opportunities to drive improvement in everything you do.", "And with that, Jennifer, let's open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "And our first question comes from the line of Michael Feniger with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Ed Egl - Waste Management, Inc.", "Good morning, Michael.", "Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll keep it at two. Just first on the pricing. So, you're guiding 4% for the full year. Q4 was very strong. So, just how much of this is just the tougher comps? Is price increases just getting more challenging now than they were in 2016? And how should we think about pricing kind of playing off through the year?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "No. I think, Michael, it's the fact that we have I think several years said that that we'll be at a 2% yield and a 4% core price and we're kind of sticking to that. We think that's a pretty safe range for this. When you look at whether we saw any kind of sequential weakness we didn't \u2013 the four lines of business that ultimately showed price increases for us are commercial, industrial, resi and MSW. And when I looked at those sequentially commercial was up quarter-over-quarter 10 basis points, 50 basis points in industrial, we were down 40 basis points in resi, and then, we were up 20 basis points in MSW. So, collection and disposal sequentially was flat at 2.1%. So, I think what you're seeing in 2017 is just kind of a standard 2% and 4%, which is where we've guided I think over the last four years.", "Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. That helps. And I guess if we could just talk about inflation and CPI. Can you quantify the headwind that we saw in 2016? And what we should be expecting in 2017? If we see inflation starts to pick up over the next few months, is this more of a 2018 story? I hope you guys could kind of parse that out for us.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah, Michael. Jim Trevathan here. CPI or index-driven pricing affects about 40% of our total business. So, to quantify that about a 50 basis point increase in CPI would impact our top-line by $28 million. But I also want to stress as Jim just did that we don't plan for CPI increases in our business plan. So, you're right, an increase has some upside to it, but we don't plan for a decrease either. Our core pricing strategy allows each area, and we ask them to overcome any CPI increase or decrease with more core pricing, we do that on, obviously, those open-market customers. So, we've overcome the low CPI rates in past years and you've not seen any impact to that core price.", "So, an increase \u2013 although it will occur, and I think you're right, it does have a roll-forward impact. It would be later in the years. You see it because our price increases don't come every month. They come especially on those CPI or index-driven price customers. They come periodically, July 1 or October 1 based on the contract term. So, that will be more of a late 2017, 2018 if we see that CPI increase. But I stress again, we generally have not let that affect us positively or negatively. We're going to go get core price.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "There is a bit of a lag there too, Jim.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "There is a lag.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "With CPI, these contracts are tied to it, as Jim mentioned. But they have a look-back period, it tends to be 12 months. And then, of course, as Jim mentioned too, we've got these periodic increases that are kind of July 1 or January 1. So, that lag is probably at least 12 months and sometimes as long as 18 months.", "Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "That's really helpful. And just, if I could squeeze in my last one, Jim. What do you think is an appropriate incremental margin we should be thinking about at this point of cycle for Waste Management?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "I mean, I think when you think about the fact that our landfill volume has been strong, our commercial volume has been the strongest we've had in at least four years. If you think about 50% flow-through to the EBITDA line, I think that's probably appropriate.", "Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Credit Suisse.", "Ed Egl - Waste Management, Inc.", "Good morning, Andrew.", "Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to dig into the recycling, you guys said that would help you guys about $0.03 in 2017 and looks like some of that is coming more so in Q1. Can you talk about \u2013 I would think that would be a little bit more of a benefit given where commodity prices are going. So, what are your assumptions around pricing for commodities and just generally for recycling?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yes. So, when we think about commodity prices and particularly when we think about recycling line of business, 2017 is the first year in four years that we're actually budgeting some improvements. We're budgeting $0.03 per share for the year, $0.02 of that comes from price, $0.01 of it comes from continued cost improvements that we've baked into the plan.", "Now, most of that is in Q1, a little bit in Q2, but most of that is in Q1, and we do expect prices to come back down in the back half of the year. So, I think what this really amplifies is the point that we made last year, which is that commodity prices are difficult to predict and obviously, out of control. So, we need to de-risk the model, and we've done that over the last four quarters to six quarters. So that if prices do retreats, we've really protected the downside.", "Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay. Okay.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "We only have a couple of contracts that remain into 2017 that are significant contracts that will fall off and that will give some value there from them, but we have altered all of our agreements, the significant large ones, to make sure that our customers are providing the return or processing their material and then that commodity price impact is minimized. We're not taking that same risk. So, there's only a couple of those lifts. Our operating guys have done a really good work at putting in continuous improvement programs that let us see historically and also look at volumes coming in and just right-size our operations. So, we make sure we get that operating improvement that Jim mentioned.", "Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay. All right. That's helpful. For volumes, I thought about 2% was pretty much better than I expected. Just looking at the breakdown, was there anything that surprised you within the breakout? MSW, C&D, and special, any one-time projects that are going away? Are there really just tough comps that you're basing your guidance for 2017 on?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "I think you're right. When we look at landfill volumes for the year at MSW at 7.5%, that's pretty strong in a 2% economy, if you believe that the economy drives that. When you look at our C&D volume, I mean, C&D volume was \u2013 for the year was 18% \u2013 18.7% I think. So, hard to repeat that. We're not seeing any weakness there, but hard to repeat that.", "Now, I would say on the positive there, if you believe that those are going to be difficult comparisons. On the positive side, I would say our special waste, which is driven by kind of the industrial economy was really only at about 3.9%, 4%. So, you may argue that we've got some upside there. Still not weak by any stretch of the imagination, but I do think that special waste that could provide some upside, particularly if something comes out of Washington that benefits the industrial economy.", "Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay.", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "From a comparison perspective, the one thing I would add is that in the first quarter of 2016, we did see some MSW volume benefits from some of the waste-to-energy facilities, meeting their maximum capacity. And that will prove to be a bit of a tough comparison, but that's not something that would impact the full year. It just really impacted the first quarter.", "Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay. And your commercial is very strong. What are your thoughts on that into 2017, because obviously that's an important piece to the puzzle?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. For the year, it was 0.8% volume on commercial. But sequentially, it was getting stronger. So, I think I mentioned in my script that it was really strong towards the end of the year at 2%. And as I look back, that's the strongest number I see on the page here all the way back to 2012. So, we like the direction of commercial. And I think Jim talked about the fact that our churn has been a success story for us too, and that, of course, affects commercial volume as well.", "Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Yeah. And similar to that special waste piece you would think that the infrastructure or potential \u2013 something out of Washington could help that commercial side to as \u2013 may be some confidence to that.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "It's more on the industrial line of business, honestly.", "Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "But it certainly wouldn't hurt commercial, but I think the industrial economy for us with respect to collection tends to show up more in the industrial line of business.", "Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah, Andrew, if you look back in our net commercial volume and you go back 6 or 8, 9, 10 quarters, in fact every quarter, we've had good improvement, leading to that 2%, and that's obviously what the economy hasn't driven much of that. Most of it has come from some of the actions that we've taken around service to our customers, process to handle customers that have issues and how we work through those. Our people in the field have done just a superb job in that regard to get that defection rate down pretty close to the lowest ever.", "And then, our customer acquisition methods are getting \u2013 we're just getting better at looking for the right kind of volume that Jim stressed to make sure that we still get the contribution from that and don't disrupt the marketplace. And that'd be the last thing we want to do. And we're focused really hard on that, picking the right locations that have a little more economy support, and make sure our resources, sales resources and operating resources align with that, so we can take advantage of that growth. And we're using some of our technology tools Jim mentioned to help us in that regard. And I think you'll see that continue. It's been fairly dramatic on one of our more profitable lines of business and we expect that to continue.", "Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay. That's it for me. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Corey Greendale with First Analysis.", "Ken C. Wang - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Hi. This is Ken Wang on for Corey. Thanks for taking my questions. I'm just wondering if you can talk a little bit about your M&A outlook, specifically any comments on what your plans are, what you're seeing in terms of seller expectations, and any commentary you can offer on pipeline.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Sure, Ken. Look, we'd like to do more of the RCIs, the Deffenbaughs, DSWs that we've done over the last couple of years, at reasonable prices. And that's I think the key. Obviously, return on invested capital is very important to us, so you're not going to see us pay 12 or 13 times EBITDA on a pre-synergy basis for companies. We continue to kind of comb the landscape and see if we can find those midsize acquisitions at what we think is a fair purchase price. If we don't find those, then 2017 is really going to be a year of tuck-in acquisitions in the $100 million to $200 million range.", "Ken C. Wang - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Thanks. That's helpful. And any update on your EBITDA acquisition outlook for 2017?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "We really only have tuck-ins built in to EBITDA. So, it's largely organic growth on the EBITDA line of business or on the EBITDA line in 2017. A little bit of carry-over from acquisitions in 2016 as well.", "Ken C. Wang - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Great. That's all I had. Thank you.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs.", "Derrick Laton - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey. Good morning. It's Derrick Laton on for Brian. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to see if we could get a quick update on how we should think about residential volumes. You mentioned those are down about 2.6% year-over-year, but looks like sequentially a small improvement. Was this mainly attributed to the progress you're making on moving to an inflation index that more kind of closely mirrors the waste industry? Maybe we can get an update on your progress there.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah, Derrick. There's no doubt. That has been a positive impact to us as we change some of those contracts over to that wastewater and sewer increase instead of just CPI. That's a slow process with cities and counties and government entities because cost is so important to them.", "I think the other thing I'd mention is that that line of business is an extremely competitive line of business, especially with those midsized and smaller communities. They are always looking for savings. Now, what we've tried to do is look more at just return on invested capital. That line of business has such a strong impact on capital requirements as you retain a contract and that entity wants new trucks or with new business.", "So, return on invested capital's our primary focus there because it has such an effect on our return and that you all care about and we do as well. So, we don't look at it as a growth opportunity like we might other lines of business. We look contract by contract. And yeah, we choose to and we will improve that business. We're doing things using technology and trying to differentiate ourselves, especially on those larger franchise and larger contracts providing some self-service opportunities for customers, some things that local communities look for that we can add to websites both with regard to trash services, but other information that might again set us apart from some of our other competitors.", "Looking at increased automation, how can we help with those helpers on the back of the truck and get more focused on the drivers. Some of the shortages that we see with automation, we tend to retain drivers longer when they have that kind of truck, and we get better return for our shareholders as well. So all of those things I think will help that line of business, but I don't believe you'll see the dramatic change like you may have in whether it's MSW or special waste or commercial, industrial lines of business. We'll plod along and make good excellent returns for shareholders, but we'll do it spending money wisely.", "Derrick Laton - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. That's really helpful. And then maybe just one more. So, you've mentioned that in 3Q leachate and waste water developments were kind of a headwind for the quarter. Are these issues squarely behind you now? Thanks. I'll turn it over.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Well, yes. So, you're right. Leachate was a headwind, and we talked about it a bit last year. We've lost some low cost disposal options for our sales with some of these POTWs, specifically the one we mentioned last year was in the State of Virginia, but it's not limited to Virginia. So, we've built a couple of our own plants. We built one outside of Philadelphia a couple years ago. We are in the process of bringing one up and online in Virginia. That will come online at the end of Q2 or maybe the beginning of Q3. So, that Virginia plant coming online in the back half of the year will have a run rate expense reduction of about $0.03 per share, $0.02 to $0.03 per share for the year. We've built in about $0.015 of expense reduction in leachate costs. And then of course, we also have the charge that we put into place last year that's helping us compensate for some of that increase in cost.", "Derrick Laton - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great. That's helpful color. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, everyone. So, I can appreciate you guys are taking a conservative approach to commodity prices. Now that you've restructured a lot of these contracts, can you maybe just give us an update and quantify what a $10 change or a 10% change in the commodity basket might mean?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "So, $10 change, it's about $0.04 on an annual basis.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "$0.04, okay.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "$0.04 annual?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. Joe, as we've changed those contracts as exactly as you said, we're not taking as much of that risk on the downside. Therefore, we don't get as much on the upside. There's value to us when we do that, but it's not as dramatic as it was when we took all that upon ourselves. We're trying to make sure that the capital that we've spent at building these facilities provides a return for shareholders that's a reasonable return given the build, the spend. And then we'll share in that commodity value instead of take all that risk, and that's what you see happening. So, generally.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "I understand. I'm sorry. I was just going to say \u2013 go ahead.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. I was just going to say, look, Devina mentioned it's tough for us to predict what's going to happen with commodity prices. Every time we've tried, we've failed. So, we tried to predict first quarter, and we think that looks like it's going to play out the way we expected based on where we finished the year. But predicting, I'll pass that.", "I mean, you could look at the transition historically from Q3 to Q4 and historically there's been a big dip in commodity prices from Q3 to Q4. We didn't see that dip this year, and we actually thought it would happen and it just didn't. So, are we going to say that that's a new normal for us? I don't know. I think the problem is, as soon as we say that's the new normal, then we'll get back to normal and we'll see the big dip in Q4 next year.", "So, we expected it, that you might ask while we're being conservative with recycle pricing. That's why I did mention early on that it's the first year in four that we put anything into our budget in terms of improvement, in terms of recycling line of business from commodity prices. And we did put $0.02 in there, we put $0.03 in total, two of it is price-related. But, it's just \u2013 in our minds it's hard to predict what happens with commodity prices. 30% of our volume goes to China, really hard to tell what's going to happen overseas. So, while you may say it's conservative and we might even agree with that, I think we've got to make sure that we don't get ourselves in a bind the way we have in years past.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Right. And I get it's \u2013 you just don't have visibility on it. I think it's a prudent way to do it. I just wanted to check in the $10 change given you guys, have restructured contracts. Maybe switching gears. I think you guys snuck-in just a quick comment on an investment for New York City contract. Can you just give us a little bit of color around what that is and how much that investment might be?", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah .Sure, Joe. I should probably take the opportunity first to just recognize our team. That was some excellent long-term contract for us and gives us a real basis for supplying service to the New York City area for a long time, for 20 years in fact. So, a really good contract for us with a lot of work by that local team, we'll start accepting MTS, MSW in July of 2017. That waste will go to our Western New York High Acres landfill in early 2018 at the peak of volume, that's about 750,000 tons a year. We'll split that volume between our Western New York landfill and then one of our Virginia landfills. We'll spend money. We've already started a little bit. That's why you saw some of the capital spin that Devina mentioned going up in 2017, and it's in the $50 million range. It includes quite a bit of containers, primary amount of spin.", "Those MTS is, by the way, when they're fully operational the New York City \u2013 they're implementing, they're executing and building out those transfer stations. We'll end up handling 1.8 million tons for the city at the end of this in total given two MTS contracts, the long-term Bronx contract we have, the Brooklyn contract that we have, and the Queens contract we have. It's sizeable. Over a 20-year period, it's little over $3 billion in revenue.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Congrats on the win. So, can you maybe just talk about the return profile and the risk profile of the contract? Does it end up being accretive to overall Waste Management? And then, hopefully, I can circle up offline and get some more details on it. Thanks.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yes, Joe. It absolutely is accretive to both 2016 or planned in 2017. It's a very good contract for us. It's primary \u2013 it's transportation and disposal at our site. It does not include collection. It's just the receipt of the material, the railing of the material, handling, and then disposal at the other end. So, that line of business is good for us, and this contract is very good for us.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. Because of the line of business, Joe, it ends up \u2013 that contract ends up being an accretive to margin contract because disposal is such a high margin for us.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Right. And from a risk standpoint, Joe, we've \u2013 just like all the other New York City contracts we have, we've got all the right components in there to make sure that we're covered if the city decides to go with different direction, and we don't expect that. But if they do, we're covered from a capital standpoint and from a cost standpoint. So, we don't see the risk that you might expect with that long-term contract. It has all the right escalators in that cover cost change. So, we're very pleased with the work our local team has done to win that project.", "Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. Thank you, guys.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "You bet.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital.", "Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Good morning. Just a question on longer-term capital allocation, it looks like you guys are not very levered. The dividend increase is lower than free cash flow growth and profile. When you think about M&A, you mentioned accretive acquisitions, are there anti-trust issues for you to grow in solid waste? And how do you think about prioritizing sort of industrial waste, energy waste, medical waste? Any sense of long-term capital allocation around M&A would be very helpful.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "That was kind of four questions in one there. Let me tackle the capital allocation first. So, first of all, yeah, with respect to how we think about capital allocation for 2017, primarily for 2017, we look at that dividend coming out first, and we increased the dividend by 3.7%. You're right, it did not increase at the same level as free cash flow. You recall last year in January, we took kind of a 6.5% increase because we felt like our free cash flow had reached a new baseline. So, we said it had gone from kind of the 1.2%, 1.3% up to 1.4% last January, so we increased it by a higher-than-normal amount. And you could argue that we're now at somewhat of a higher base too at 1.5%. I think we like to have more than just a year's worth of data before we determine that we truly are at a higher base. So, 2017 will provide that data for us, we think, and then we'll readdress the dividend as we go into the latter part of this year or next year.", "So, once you take the dividend out, once you say, okay, then potentially your next use of capital would be acquisitions. And I talked about the fact that we'd love to get a mid-sized acquisition similar to an RCI or Deffenbaugh, but we've got to get it at the right price. We're looking for those. And to the extent that we can find them, then we would do that. And I think Devina has done a very good job getting the balance sheet in shape to be able to accept one of those should one come along. If it doesn't come along, then we'll do our standard $100 million to $200 million in tuck-ins, plus we'll do about $500 million as what we've built in in terms of share repurchase to our budget for 2017.", "And then you did ask also, Hamzah, about the types of acquisitions that we would look at. So, we consider that industrial space to be a good space for us. It's a core space for us. We would look at acquisitions within that space, whether they'd be energy services or hazardous waste. All of that, in our minds, is core for us, particularly as you think about what might come out of this new administration with respect to the industrial economy. It could be a good space for us. And so, we would look at those along the same line as we would look at solid waste.", "And then I guess your last question had to do with anti-trust. It's always something we have to look at. As the biggest company in the industry, we always have to look at the anti-trust side of this. It is a consideration when we buy businesses, but we don't foresee with anything that we're looking at any real difficulties.", "Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thank. Since I asked four; I'll leave it there. Thank you.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Thanks, Hamzah.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Barbara Noverini with Morningstar.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Hey. Good morning, everybody.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Hi, Barbara.", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "So I'm interested in some of your high-level thoughts about some of the policy talk coming out of Washington. Obviously, you mentioned that an uptick in the industrial economy would benefit you as would, of course, a lower corporate tax rate. But what do you make of some of the talk concerning regulation? I know particularly the EPN environment regulation, obviously, the new administration has been talking about the potential for simplifying or relaxing certain regulations?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "That's a great question, Barbara. We've talked a lot about that internally. Environmental regulation, in a funny way, is a differentiator for us because we consider ourselves to be preeminent in terms of our protection of the environment within the waste disposal space. So, it is a question that we've had. Do we benefit or not? There's a second side to that coin. It's a bit hard to tell because we just don't know what's going to come out. We don't know what environmental regulation or reregulation or deregulation would come out of Washington. So, we really can't give you a very good answer to that. I would tell you that off-the-top that it would be \u2013 there's a potential opportunity we think out there to improve the Superfund program. So, that would be, I think, good for us. But over and above that, it's a bit hard to say because we just don't know where it would be coming from.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Sure. Yeah. No, interesting things. And then just one more. With the prices for recyclable commodities improving, are you starting to see local competition pick up again? And also, have you seen smaller competitors follow your lead and change their contracts, too, to include processing costs, contamination, reimbursement or what have you?", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. Barbara, we have not seen dramatic change in competition there. It's a very competitive line of business. But we've not seen anything different recently. I mean, it's been such short time since they move forward. And I don't think that'll happen in the short term. It takes a lot high cardboard prices to make that happen and sustained. I think people have been burned enough that they're not going to spend capital with new facilities until we see the right direction. And, yes, I think in general, I mean, we don't change things because of what others do. But at the same time, from just hearsay, we think it's so prudent to do what we all have been doing around de-risking that business, and we don't see any signs of that changing.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Makes sense. Thanks a lot.", "Ed Egl - Waste Management, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer.", "Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Hi. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. We've talked early in the call about a couple of \u2013 maybe some special items on the capital spending side, on the CapEx side. You called out a $50 million swing from 2016 to 2017, the New York City spend, you mentioned the leachate spend. I guess, can we talk a little bit about how to think about a more normalized kind of CapEx level and the potential for CapEx spending moderation looking beyond 2017 because it does seem like there are a number of higher items impacting the year?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. Absolutely, Noah. What we've said for quite some time since I was in the CFO job, we've said that \u2013 we thought CapEx would be in a range of percent of revenue of about 9% to 10%. So, when you look at 2017 and the CapEx guidance that we gave of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, that's in that range for us. We do have, as we talked about, some CapEx that moved unexpectedly from 2016 into 2017. And then the rest of the increase is driven by the growth of the business and the two contracts that Jim Trevathan mentioned. Even with the $50 million that's moved from 2016 to 2017, we still think we're within that CapEx range. And I don't think you'll see us to really move much outside of that 9% to 10%.", "Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Okay. That's very helpful. And then maybe one quick follow-up, specifically on the tax reform discussion going on. Just wondering how that's impacting M&A discussions. Certainly, the potential for more cash to you and they also impact the economics of transactions for buyers and sellers. So, to what extent is that having an impact on discussion maybe on timing at all of transactions and how are you thinking about that as kind of impacting the M&A activity over the course of the year? Thank you so much.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Probably, Devina will have a better answer to this than I will. But with respect to how it's impacting our view of acquisitions, we haven't \u2013 I would tell you we haven't looked at that as an impediment at all. It's hard to say because \u2013 again, it's kind of like the environmental question. We don't really know what comes out of the administration. There's been a lot of conversation about interest deductibility going away. So, how would that impact the way we think about funding these acquisitions? There's also been some conversations about the grandfathering of debt that is \u2013 that you have on your balance sheets prior to kind of an April 1 or April 30. So, we hear a lot of this. It's probably just chatter amongst people who don't know. So, in that respect, I would tell you that it hasn't really influenced our decision. Our decision is going to be based much more on the purchase price than it is on the funding mechanism.", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "And then to the extent that it's impacting the way that sellers think about the landscape for moving forward with transactions at this point, we definitely think \u2013 as we've talked internally, we do think that our sellers are going to be influenced by the evolution of tax policy. And it certainly is going to be a factor in the way that they think about the optimal time to move away from their businesses. So, it's too early for us to say whether or not it can impact our ability to execute on that targeted $100 million to $200 million of tuck-in acquisitions or any other potential acquisitions that we may look at in the future. But we do think that with tax reform, you're going to see some sellers more motivated to move forward potentially, given that they'll likely have lower taxes to pay as a result of a transaction.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "I told you, Noah. She'd give a better answer.", "Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Well, I appreciate the additional color. Thank you very much, and congrats on the quarter.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey, good morning.", "Ed Egl - Waste Management, Inc.", "Hi, Tyler.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey, Jim. I know you don't give quarterly guidance, but if I recall, last Q1 was really strong on an extra day and I think mild weather. How should we be thinking about volumes here in Q1 versus the full-year guide of 1.2% and 1.6%?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Well, you're absolutely right about that. Last year, was a very mild winter. So, we were a bit worried when we talked about Q1 last April that we would have told \u2013 the big question was how much volumes that we pull into Q1, particularly into the month of March because March was very strong. I mean, January and February were fine, but March was particularly strong last year.", "I would tell you that aside from the bad rains that we've seen on the West Coast, primarily in Northern California, that the weather has been kind of normal this year, not as mild as last year, but the weather has not had a dramatic impact on us so far. Now, we're only halfway through Q1, but I think so far, we're pleased with what we're seeing. It hasn't been a 2014 or whatever it was where we had the polar vortex or 2015 where New England had 50 feet of snow. It's been more of a normal winter, and hence our volumes have been kind of what we expected.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Okay. That's a good color. And then you guys noted New York and I think LA as well as contract wins. I'm just curious how much of the volume growth this year is attributable to those?", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yes, you're right, Tyler. I didn't mention the LA contract, but it's a new agreement that we've been awarded. We've been awarded two of those zones that the City of LA has extended. We've got the exclusive commercial and multi-family franchise for the West Valley and Southeast Valley zones. The real good thing there is that they are contiguous with our current infrastructure, and it really fits our business. And we're very pleased with that. It's also a large contract, life of value of that contract. It's a 10-year deal. It's $1.3 billion at accretive margins to the company.", "But in our plan, I mean the LA is scheduled to start July 1, to the point of your question, July 1. We have until the end of the year, so until January of 2018, to make the transition. And the real issue there as opposed to New York City is that we currently have 8,500 customers in that open market of LA that's going to these franchises, we'll end up with 16,000 customers by roughly January of 2018. So, they'll piece their way into our structure during the course of the second half of 2017. Yeah, so.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Some hundred did go to other \u2013 it's not just an incremental 8,000.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "That's right.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "There's some swapping going on here, so.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "A lot of operating involved.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "So, there's a lot of logistics involved.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "A lot of operating cost changes that'll occur in the second half of the year. So, I don't think you'll see dramatic value. And we haven't put that in our plan dramatically at to be at July 1 run rate. We've parsed that in throughout the months in the second half of this year. The same for New York City. Although it starts July 1, there's some work to be done at the MTSs and to get the rail capability right for High Acres and Atlantic. So, that'll piece its way in. They'll help our volumes, but there I think our volume forecast and guidance is about what we expect.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. No, that's helpful. And Devina, I know the K will print soon, but what were cash taxes paid in 2016? And is the expectation that cash taxes paid in 2017 will be roughly the same in terms of dollars? And is this kind of the right \u2013 I don't know if this is the right technical term \u2013 but kind of a cash tax as a percentage of pre-tax if that make sense?", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "Right. So cash taxes paid in 2016 were $470 million. We expect those to increase by about $125 million in 2017, and of course that will vary depending upon our pre-tax income and how the year actually comes in. So, I wouldn't say that 2016 is a normal year because we had a $100 million realization from the debt restructuring that we carried forward into 2016. So, look for 2017, again, it's too early to say what tax reform will do, but look for 2017 to be a more normal year at that $600 million level.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Very helpful. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hi, Jim, Jim, Devina. Thanks for taking my questions. I mean, believe it or not, there's still some left. I have a question with regards to volumes. Given your urban model, your higher concentration of urban, there was a slower recovery in some of that commercial container volume, but it's clearly had showed up in 2016. And that's better quality business than C&D and special waste. So, as that shift is occurring, how do we think about the operating leverage to the business model of that, and where do you think you are in innings, if you will, if we would frame it that way?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "So, Jim and I can take a shot at that. But I think you're right about that, and I think as you talk about the urban model, it really ultimately starts to show up in the commercial line of business I think. And that's why I think you've seen \u2013 that's a part of why I believe you've seen our commercial volume on a nice increasing trend over the past probably 12 quarters. But there are more pieces to that.", "There's the fact that we're doing a better job with customer service and so we're hanging on to a bigger percentage of our business. The churn has gone, as Jim mentioned, from a high of 11.5% or close to 12%, down to approaching 9%, and we think we've got the opportunity to get to 9% on a full-year basis or even below. But you're right, Michael. I think that this urbanization of the United States and Canada as well is resulting in these commercial volumes for an urban company like Waste Management. We're largely in kind of urban areas, is resulting in some of that volume growth.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And so following through, the operating leverage, you should see this ongoing operating leverage as a result of this improving pattern that hasn't peaked yet.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Well that's right because, as you know, the commercial line of business has higher operating leverage than the other lines of business, particularly residential. So yeah, I think while we take some credit for this, when we look at OpEx as a percent of revenue, some of it is the efforts of our SDO and our MSDO, so a lot of it is what we are actually proactively doing. Some of it is just what you say, which is the as volume moves into the commercialized business, our operating, our flow-through really improves.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Hey, Michael. Three points to \u2013 that total agreement with Jim and your theory of, for example, our addition rate and that's largely driven by the commercial line of business, although it includes the industrial line as well, the permanent business on the industrial roll-off line. But we have flipped that addition rate and defection rate, so that we're net positive in number of new customers, starting roughly midyear to early third quarter last year. And that, we see that continuing of the add rate has gone up fairly dramatically, just as the defection rate has gone down. So those lines have crossed. And that's a really good sign for us, both in the selling process, but in the overall economy, as you mentioned.", "The other thing I mentioned earlier, is that service increases have outpaced decreases 12 consecutive quarters, and that's a real positive for us. And it bodes well given some of the economy improvements that we're seeing. And then lastly, the container weight issue has not changed dramatically for us up or down. I mean, it stayed about where it is. And that's, we think, a good sign. The economy is moving forward, and we think we will gain both revenue, but more importantly margin out of that growth.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And that last point, is it flattish with a positive bias or flattish, just flattish?", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah, just flattish, it depends on quarter-by-quarter, it's changed some. But not so much with service increases. That's been very consistently positive.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then if we could shift gears to the sales outlook for 2017. If I take your comments about price volume, recycling, guess at what the deal rollover is, and I'm assuming you're somewhere around $50 million or $60 million a deal rollover, that puts you kind of in a $1.42 billion or I mean, $14.2 billion to $14.3 billion. But then if I hear your comment about capital spending as a percent of revenues, I take the midpoint, I'm at $14.5 billion. So I'm trying to understand, what's the right sales number for 2017?", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "We're thinking about revenues being just north of $14 billion in 2017.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "So, kind of $14.1 billion to $14.2 billion?", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "I would say on the low end of that, Michael.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. That seems very conservative. I mean, if you just take the price and volume assumptions you've given on the 13.6%, that puts you at 14.07%.", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "So, I would say the way that we're looking at it is the build of volumes of 1.2% to 1.6% price of right \u2013 or yields of right around 2%. And then we're not building in anything specific under recycling line of business from commodity price. We're not building in anything from foreign currency, either, and we also leave fuel flat. So, ultimately, that's what builds from this year's 13.6% to 14.05% to 100%, basically I would say.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "And I think the lack of acquisition at the same level as what we've done with those three regionals that Jim mentioned, we have in there I think a little over $100 million, $150 million in tuck-in acquisitions. But we don't have acquisitions at the same level as the last three years in the plan. We'd love for them to happen, but we're not forecasting that today.", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "That's a great point, Jim.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "You mentioned, Michael \u2013 I think you mentioned $50 million carryover on the top line, I think you were saying. And really because we did the acquisitions at the very beginning of 2016, we think there will be some carryover on the bottom line from some of the cost synergies, but the top-line really won't see \u2013 other than what Jim mentioned, won't see much in the form of inorganic growth.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. That's fair enough. That helps. Actually pulls that closer.", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "And the other piece of that, Michael, that might be helpful is that we've got to think about yield as being off of an $11 billion base of revenue rather than the $13 billion.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Got it.", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "Okay.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "That's a big part of it then. Okay. That's fair enough. And then, yeah, I just want to touch one quick question on the regulation. I mean, this industry has got very mature regulation. There's very little changing around the margin. Even if Scott Pruitt comes in and got the heck out of EPA, the regulation you've lived with are really very mature. So, there's a probably bigger probably that whatever happens, regulatory was going to impact your customer more than it's going to impact you directly. Isn't it \u2013 is that fair?", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "I completely agree with you.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Whether it's MSW regulations that affect our landfills or whether it's regulatory impacts to our landfill structure or recycling or hazardous waste business. Those states are allowed to exceed the federal guidelines and some do, and I don't see that impacted. I just don't see states getting in and changing those kinds of regulations that would impact our business. Could something come out of the blue? I guess it could. But I have seen nothing, no discussion or no intonation that it's even close to affecting our business the way the question was worded.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. I think one exception to that would be the Superfund.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "That's right.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Which is really regulated.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Right, which is the other side of that, which is if Pruitt rolls back the levering enforcement budget the way it was and using enforcement, so less enforcement to a lot of industrial players look at the project world and say this is the most favorable environment I'm ever going to have to clean things up, so let's get them done in the next four years.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "But they still have to clean them up.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yeah. And might as well do it with a friendly regulator than one that's been thumping near the head with the club.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "That's the upside, right?", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yeah. Right. Okay.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "That we think that could come out of this, but as we've said to the earlier question, it's a little hard to tell because we just don't have real goods visibility yet.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Four weeks in. Last question, what \u2013 are you getting a blended average tip fee positive impact from being awarded the two Brooklyn Marine Transfer Stations when you think about where that volume is going?", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "One more time, Michael. I'm sorry.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "So, when you think about the implied tip fee that's in the total price that they're paying per ton, because there's \u2013 certain amount of it is for logistics, but the rest of it for \u2013 you can walk back to that logistics part out and get to what's the tip fee look like, are you getting a tip fee improvement as a result of the New York City contract at high acres or I'm assuming this is going down to, is it King George?", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah, down to the Atlantic landfill. Well, first of all, Michael, we don't publicize that number, we don't \u2013 the individual disposal component. It is an all-in price for transportation and disposal and includes a lot of handling up the material and moving the material. But it is not going to be a detrimental impact to the company on a margin basis. It is accretive in margin both EBIT, EBITDA. So, we are \u2013 that's \u2013 those two are very good contracts for us.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Very good. Thank you.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Ed Egl - Waste Management, Inc.", "All right. Thanks.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "So, just to close here, 2016 really was a great year for us. And closing with such a strong year really gives us confidence that the business is hitting on all cylinders. I think we have the team, the strategy, the assets, the culture to make this year and years to follow successful really by any measure.

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the express written consent of Waste Management is prohibited.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's President and CEO, Jim Fish.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Thanks, Ed, and thank you, all, for joining us this morning. Our second quarter results have again demonstrated the cash-generating strength of our company. Our tactical focus on improving core price, adding profitable volume in a disciplined manner, and controlling costs is clearly the right direction for our business. The end result of that focus is once again a strong operating EBITDA performance, which translated into robust cash flow in the quarter.", "Our operating EBITDA grew about 8% in the quarter to $1.029 billion when compared to the second quarter of 2016. This was the highest operating EBITDA we've ever achieved in any quarter in Waste Management's long history. As a result, our free cash flow grew almost 13% for the same comparative period despite a significant increase in cash taxes paid.", "The conversion rate of operating EBITDA to free cash flow has increased sequentially for the past three quarters to over 50% in the second quarter of 2017. Devina will discuss our cash flow in detail, but we exceeded our internal expectations. And we remain confident that we can meet the upper end of our full year guidance of between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion.", "Turning to earnings per share, we generated $0.81 of EPS in the second quarter, an increase of 10.4% when compared to the second quarter of 2016. Included in that 10.4% growth were a $0.04 drag to EPS, $0.02 from an increased tax rate, $0.01 from the expiration of fuel tax credits and $0.01 from two small impairments. But even with that $0.04 of headwind, we grew EPS by $0.07 versus the second quarter of 2016.", "Driving strong growth in EPS, EBITDA and free cash flow with solid growth in revenue and operating income, our revenues grew by $252 million or 7.4%. And just as we saw in the first quarter, this increase was organically driven. Our income from operations grew 9.4% and margins also expanded with the income from operation margin of 30 basis points.", "One of the drivers of our success was the disciplined execution of our pricing programs. In the second quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.7%, and our yield was 1.9%. Our focus on disciplined pricing remains unchanged as demonstrated by our core price results, which are well above our full year goal.", "Looking at volumes, our traditional solid waste volumes were positive 3.2% in the second quarter. We continue to focus on areas of the economy that are experiencing growth, and we are retaining customers through our improved customer service.", "In the second quarter, the underlying volume growth in our business remains strong in the commercial, industrial, and landfill lines of business. And we also saw slight improvements in the rate of decline in our residential business. As a result, we would expect our volumes to exceed our full year goal. And as you can see, we're maintaining our price discipline, while growing our volume.", "So, we're hitting on all cylinders right now, with the cash-generating strength of our business shining brightly in 2017.", "Looking beyond 2017, we've talked recently about our strategy of bringing more technology to bear in our business and about creating a 21st Century HR organization. On the people front, we're tackling long-term opportunities like reducing driver turnover, building best-in-class leadership development, and leading in the field of training and performance management.", "Regarding technology, our focus there is intended to serve as a differentiator to help us continue down this path of strong organic growth. They will come in several different forms, including customer-facing technologies for e-commerce and self-service, use of big data for predictive analytics like maintenance and dynamic routing, and improvement in our cost structure over the long-term through the application of robotics and autonomy.", "Of course, we will not lose our focus on disciplined capital expenditures and SG&A expense control as we proceed with this long-term strategy. We plan to have a strategic leader of the technology function placed by year-end.", "So, to sum it up, we've had an exceptional first half of 2017 and our employees continue to execute our plans and deliver strong performance. In the second half of 2017, we expect to see the momentum from the first half continue. As a result, we expect to meet the upper end of both our full year EPS guidance of between $3.14 and $3.18, and our full year free cash flow guidance of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion.", "I will now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our second quarter operating results in more detail.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Thanks, Jim, and good morning. The fundamentals of our pricing programs, disciplined growth, and cost initiatives continue to drive income from operations and operating EBITDA growth. The combined positive price and positive volume led the total company income from operations growing $58 million, an increase of more than 9%, and operating EBITDA growing $78 million, an increase of about 8% compared to the second quarter of 2016.", "Looking at revenue in more detail in the second quarter, we continued to see strong organic revenue growth, as we focused on the execution of our price plans, customer service improvement, and disciplined growth. Revenues in the quarter were $3.68 billion, an increase of $252 million or 7.4% when compared to the second quarter of 2016.", "Second quarter revenue growth in our collection and disposal business from the combined impact of price and volume was $158 million. Second quarter revenues also benefited from higher recycling commodity prices and increased recycling volumes, which drove a $90 million increase in recycling revenues. Fuel surcharges increased $20 million, while foreign currency fluctuations decreased revenues by $8 million, and divestitures, net of acquisitions, also decreased revenue for the quarter by $8 million.", "In the second quarter, looking at internal revenue growth, our collection and disposal core price was 4.7%, and yield was 1.9%. On the volume front, total volumes were 3.4%, while traditional solid waste volumes were 3.2%. We also saw service increases exceeding service decreases for the 14th consecutive quarter, supporting continued commercial volume growth. Our year-to-date churn rate improved 10 basis points to 9%.", "Our collection lines of business continued to perform exceptionally well. In the second quarter, commercial core price was 7% with volumes up 2.7%, another sequential increase in growth from first quarter levels of 2.5%. Industrial core price was 8.8% with volume up 2.1% in the second quarter.", "In the residential line of business, core price was 2.7%, with residential volumes down 1.7% in the second quarter, but they are moving in the right direction as the residential volume is a 20 basis point sequential improvement from the first quarter of 2017. The combined price and volume increases in our collection line of business led to income from operations growing $24 million and operating EBITDA growing $26 million.", "In the landfill line of business, total volumes increased 8.9%; MSW volumes grew 10%; C&D volume grew 17.4%; and the combined special waste and revenue-generating cover volumes grew 5.2%. On the MSW front, volumes did benefit from an outage at a Virginia Waste-to-Energy Plant. Even without that benefit, underlying MSW volume growth remains solid in the mid to high single-digits.", "Regarding pricing, we achieved core price of 2.5% in the landfill line of business and MSW yield was 2%, both improvements from the first quarter levels. The combined price and positive volume led the total income from operations growing $25 million, almost a 9% increase, and operating EBITDA growing $48 million, an increase of more than 11% compared to the second quarter of 2016.", "Turning to recycling, in the second quarter, the recycling business contributed $0.04 of EPS. And China has recently notified the WTO about a scrap import ban on certain categories of solid waste materials, including certain types of scrap plastics and unsorted waste paper. Neither of these categories should materially affect us because of our current sorting processes and capabilities. Although we do not see a material impact to our overall business, we believe this action does create further uncertainty in forecasting recycling price levels.", "Moving now to operating expenses, in the second quarter, total operating costs increased $160 million when compared with the second quarter of 2016. The cost increases were largely due to higher recycled commodity rebates, primarily related to our recycling brokerage business and rising fuel expenses.", "As Jim noted, the absence of a CNG fuel tax credit negatively impacted our EPS by slightly more than $0.01. Our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 10 basis points from 62.2% in the second quarter of 2016 to 62.3% in the second quarter of 2017. Combined cost of recycling rebates and higher fuel expenses increased 110 basis points as a percent of revenue.", "However, through efficiency gains and cost control efforts, particularly in the labor and transfer and disposal cost line, we were able to offset almost all of the increases in commodity-based costs in the quarter. Our traditional solid waste business improved operating expenses by about 70 basis points during the quarter. Thanks to the strong execution of our field and corporate teams.", "I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results.", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As Jim mentioned, the strength of our operating results in the second quarter can be seen most directly by looking at our cash flow from operations and free cash flow. In the second quarter, cash provided by operating activities was $813 million compared to $762 million in the second quarter of 2016. That's an increase of $51 million or almost 7% in spite of an additional $83 million in cash taxes.", "The significant increase in cash from operations for the quarter is the result of two things: operating EBITDA growth of $78 million or about 8%, and our disciplined focus on improving our working capital metrics.", "We're particularly pleased with the operating leverage that we can see in our cash flow from operations conversion metrics. In the first half of 2017, our operating cash flow as a percentage of revenues has been consistently over 22%, which is a 400 basis point improvement in the measure over our long-term average.", "Both capital expenditures and proceeds from divestitures were relatively flat on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter, so the growth in cash flow from operations converted straight through to free cash flow growth.", "We continue to expect the $100 million to $150 million increase in capital expenditures in 2017 as compared to last year, and our full year capital expenditure guidance is unchanged. Due to the timing of truck purchases and certain other project spending, we expect this increase to impact our free cash flow in the back half of the year.", "We generated $520 million of free cash flow in the second quarter of 2017, an increase of $59 million or 12.8% from the second quarter of 2016. For the first half of the year, we've generated over $900 million of free cash flow, putting us well on our way to meeting the upper end of our 2017 free cash flow guidance of between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion.", "The growth in free cash flow positions us to continue to return value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and to fund acquisitions. In the second quarter, we repurchased $250 million of our outstanding stock, paid $187 million in dividend, and funded $41 million in tuck-in acquisitions. We remain committed to a capital allocation plan that prioritizes using 100% of our free cash flow to pay our dividend, execute strategic acquisitions, and buy back our stock. We will do this in a disciplined way to continue to deliver the best return on invested capital in the industry.", "Our record high free cash flow in the first half of the year and the positive outlook we have for the remainder of 2017 and beyond supports the continued execution of our capital allocation plan. And so, in the third quarter, we plan to enter into agreements to repurchase an additional $500 million of our stocks, representing our remaining current year authorization for share buyback.", "Our disciplined management of SG&A costs also benefited our results for the quarter. For the second quarter of 2017, as a percent of revenue, SG&A costs were 9.6%, which is a 30 basis point improvement from the second quarter of 2016. On a dollar basis, SG&A costs were $353 million in the second quarter of 2017 or $13 million higher than in the prior year period.", "The second quarter increase is largely attributable to revenue and earnings growth, which drove up our incentive compensation cost and commission. We are successfully offsetting some of these cost increases by improving process efficiency. And we will continue to drive down SG&A as a percent of revenue by better leveraging our fixed costs. We remain confident that for the full year, SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue will approach 10%, which would represent a 40 basis point improvement compared to the full year of 2016.", "Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio measured based on our bank covenants remained at 2.4 at the end of the second quarter, indicating that we have a strong balance sheet and are well positioned for strategic acquisitions at the right price.", "Our weighted average cost of debt for the quarter was about 4.2% and 12% of our total debt portfolio was at variable rates. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2017 was approximately 36.6%, which is in line with our expected full year 2017 adjusted tax rate of about 36.5%. Our adjusted tax rate for the second quarter of 2016 was 34.7%. The increase in our tax rate from 2016 is largely due to growth in our pre-tax earnings, which is meeting the benefits of tax credits. The higher tax rate impacted EPS by $0.02 per share.", "In summary, the first half of 2017 has shown the combined value of our focus on executing our core operating objectives: generating price, growing profitable volumes, and continuous cost improvement. I want to thank all members of the Waste Management team, the best employees in the industry, as once again they have executed extremely well. They delivered fantastic results so far in 2017, and we are well on our way to achieving our 2017 goal.", "With that, Marcus, let's open the line for questions", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey, good morning, everyone.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Good morning, Brian.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Just a question on margins. Obviously, really strong volumes in the quarter. I was a little surprised that it didn't translate into a little bit more operating leverage. And I know you mentioned the tax credit issues on the fuel that it was a bit of a headwind and some of the recycling rebate. But I just wondered if you could dig into it a little bit more. I mean what kind of \u2013 in a normal quarter, what kind of operating margin leverage would you normally expect on that kind of volume growth and maybe kind of an outlook for margins for the full year. I think you had guided to up 50 to 100 bps. Maybe just provide an update on where you see that coming for the full year.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Sure, Brian. I would actually say we felt good about our margins for the quarter, and here's why. The EBITDA margins were up 10 basis points, or better by 10 basis points, but they were impacted by two factors. You mentioned the one, which was fuel tax credits. That was worth about 20 basis points to us in margin. But the other one that Jim's going to give a little bit of color on is our recycling brokerage business. And that recycling brokerage business was up over 5% in revenue, which impacted margins by 50 basis points. And so, if you exclude those two, you're talking about 70 basis points of margin accretion there. So, that's why I would say we felt good about our margins even being better by only 10 basis points on the EBITDA line.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah, Jim. Maybe just a couple of facts, first about the recycling business and then into that brokerage side. Overall pricing was up about 31%, volume was up 4%, as we said, and that lower margin brokerage business revenue grew about 10%. It is lower margin. It's 4% to 6% margin on that brokerage business, but it's still extremely healthy for us and good for us strategically.", "Just a little bit of comparison. First, the revenue is getting to be a substantial percentage of our revenue. It's significant. In fact, the brokerage business is about 2 times larger than our largest competitor's total recycling revenue. And they've got a very healthy business.", "This brokerage business is about 50% of our total recycling revenue, but just as important as that are the benefits of that business for us. With those additional tonnages, we're able to command a little higher price per ton when we sell all of the volume, both our [MRF]-generated tons and this brokerage volume. It provides our customers that use this recycled commodity with a really consistent and high-quality volume, and it lets us get, we think, a couple extra dollars per ton.", "The second thing about that brokerage business is it allows us to service these very large customers that generate this volume on a full-service basis, rather than just hauling their trash, we add some stickiness to what we do for them. And I guess the last thing I'd remind you is that these generators of this large volume in broker, they've got their own capital equipment, their balers, and they manage that volume, and we just help them sell it. So there's no capital investment to this line of business, Brian. And it helps us with what Devina said, the highest ROI in the industry. It aligns perfectly with that. And this business is almost an infinite ROI, given no capital associated with it.", "So, if I'd summarize, Jim's right, we see that 70 basis points improvement without this and that fuel tax issue. This is a really healthy business for us. If you look at one last factor maybe that we were looking at recently, if you remove that brokerage business, our overall WM Waste Management's EBITDA margin would be about 120 basis points higher, would be about 29.2% in the second quarter, again, without that brokerage business, yet, we're going to stay in that business. It's the right thing to do for our customers and very strategic for us, and it's just good business.", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "So, to follow-on with the 50 to 100 basis point margin improvement that you referenced, when we think about that, it really was going to come from two places, and we're seeing both execution in both of those things in the first half of the year. And we expect that to continue.", "And the two places that was going to come from, and we're seeing results, are core solid waste business improvement to operating expense margin; and then secondarily, SG&A cost control driving margin improvement there. So, what Jim and Jim just described was a 70 basis point improvement in operating margin for our core solid waste operations, and then we saw a 30 basis point improvement in our SG&A cost in the quarter. So, those two things together get us to the top end of that 50 to 100 basis point range.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Thanks. And one more if I could. One of your competitors this morning was talking a lot about a big pickup in acquisition opportunities in the industry. And it seems like it could be a little bit of a change from the trend that we've been on the last couple of years, for whatever reasons. Parsing your comments and maybe some of the actions with the pivot towards the share repo in a bigger way over 2Q and 3Q, maybe just kind of comment on how you see the M&A environment these days, and if you've perceived a similar kind of change over the last quarter or two.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "I mean, I think the acquisition landscape is pretty healthy right now and our pipeline is pretty healthy right now, too. We're going to talk about several today, in fact. So, I think you'll see us \u2013 we've always kind of talked about our normal tuck-ins ranging between $100 million and $200 million. Last year, we were towards the lower end of that range. I would tell you, Brian, that this year we'll be at the higher end of that range. So, I wouldn't disagree with what one of our counterparts said about the M&A landscape.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital.", "Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Good morning. Thank you. The first question is just if you could just outline whether 100 bps further opportunity on customer churn is realistic and where do you think that improvement comes from? Thank you.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah, Hamzah, good to hear from you. I do think there's upside in our defection rate, 9% year-to-date basis improved about 10 basis points. We've made real strides in two parts of that. First, the core service delivery. We are really focused on our quality of service metric across all of our lines of business, and our areas are starting to clearly show that improvement that we expect in just the core delivery of what our customers pay for, and that'll continue, but that's a long-range impact to it, because we still deliver exceptional service and yet we want to get better.", "The other side to it, Hamzah, or at least one other side, is some of the electronic e-commerce opportunities that we have. Our customers, at least segments of them, want more online capability, and we're doing a pretty good job of providing that. And as Jim mentioned earlier, we've got plans to really ramp that up and look at more opportunity to differentiate our offering to our customers.", "As you know, Hamzah, our customer segments are extremely wide from a open market residential customer, all the way up to the largest companies in the Fortune 100. So, their expectations vary across that segment basis, and we are finding things that we can do to improve that.", "But part of it is just that core discipline of service and then how we handle their questions when they call in. Our call centers are doing a really good job of focusing on answering their questions on the first call. We're making real strides there, but still connected with our field operating team. So, I do see upside improvement continuing in that defection rate. One quarter here or there, maybe a vary, but over time, you'll see that number get better and better.", "Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Great. And then, just on free cash flow, the conversion is higher than history. How sustainable is that free cash flow conversion metric as you look out longer term? And where is it coming from? Is it working capital? I know CapEx is lumpy, but any color as to how sustainable that conversion rate is.", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "You're exactly right, Hamzah. With the free cash flow conversion that we saw in the second quarter, what we're really focused on is the positive trend that we're seeing of conversion, of revenue dollars, EBITDA dollars to free cash flow. We tend to focus more on the cash flow from operation piece because of the lumpiness of capital expenditures and just timing differences that can affect that. Our capital expenditures, as a percentage of revenue, we still target that at about 9% to 10% of revenue. And we were a little below that in the second quarter.", "And if you were to have normalized that, we would have still seen some really positive flow-through and continued execution of our focus on taking revenue dollars and putting them through to the bottom line, but what we think is important is to look at that cash flow from operations metric. And as I said, that increased to over 22% of revenue in the quarter and for the full year.", "And when we look at what's driving that, it's two things. It's operating EBITDA growth and it's our focus on working capital. We do think that the focus on working capital will continue to provide us benefits, but we're more focused on that core solid waste operating performance, driving free cash flow and cash from operations growth over the long-term.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Hamzah, one thing I would add to this, and we've given some long answers to the first two questions here from you and Brian, but I think it's worth really addressing this. But Devina is absolutely right about this. I mean, it is the biggest components of free cash flow that's actually driving it, which is EBITDA. I mean, growing EBITDA by 8% organically is no easy task. And if you back up the line from there, growing revenue by 7.4% in an economy that's kind of a 1.5% or 2% economy, and doing all that with organic growth, to me, is really impressive.", "And you may \u2013 you look at revenue. Even if you took out commodity price completely, if you said, okay, fine, but you're growing your revenue, come on, take it out, take that out completely, we still grew revenue organically by 4.1% in a 1.5% or 2% economy, double or 2.5 times the economy. So, the fact that this is all translating down into free cash \u2013 cash from operations and then free cash is not surprising to us, but we're really pleased with the fact that these big financial metrics that we focus on are performing as well as they are.", "Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Yeah. That's very helpful. Just a follow-up and I'll turn it over. Historically, yourself and the sector has raised guidance on the second quarter based on seasonality of volumes that when you first give guidance, you don't have visibility on. It seems like things are coming in better than expected relative to the start of the year. And so I'm just curious, how conservative is your guidance, because you've left it unchanged? Thank you.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Well, we really didn't leave it unchanged. We said the guidance is a range. So, if you think about EPS, for example, $3.14 to $3.18, it's a range. And now, we've said we'll be at the top end of the range. So, if you assume that when we give the range, we're kind of in the middle at kind of $3.16, then we're saying we're \u2013 in effect we're raising guidance to the top end of the range, and you could say the same about free cash flow.", "So, what we'll do, though, is at the end of Q3 is reassess and look at the first three quarters and decide are we going to exceed the top end of the range or are we still comfortable at the top end, where we are now.", "Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Understood. Thanks so much.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Corey Greendale with First Analysis.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of questions from me. So, Devina, on the SG&A guidance to get to 10% for the year. So, I think in the first half of the year, you had 20 basis points of improvements, so you need to do better than 40 basis points improvement at the back half to get there. So, if you can just talk about kind of the levers and how you get to that greater leverage?", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "So, as a reminder, in the first quarter, we had a couple of headwinds on a year-over-year basis that aren't going to repeat throughout the remainder of the year. And those two things were severance costs and then a higher year-over-year comparison in how we accrue our incentive compensation costs. And so when you normalize for those two things and think about really what we demonstrated in more of a normal quarter and second quarter, we are confident that we'll get better performance in the third and fourth quarters than what you've seen in the first half of the year.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "So, I understand it and I appreciate the reminder on the Q1 headwinds. But on a dollar basis, I think the SG&A dollars will actually be down year-over-year in the back half. So, I was hoping maybe you could just give us a little more detail on kind of where the cost savings are coming from incrementally from what you've seen so far this year.", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "Sure. So, a piece of that incentive compensation accrual in the first part of the year has to do with a timing difference that will benefit the fourth quarter. And so that is a piece of this. But then, as I mentioned, we're seeing some process efficiency opportunities that continue to give us confidence that we're going to be able to reduce some of our general overhead costs, as we look for more efficient ways to carry out processes, things we've mentioned in the past, our call volumes as an example. And as we're driving more and more customers to do business with us through the e-commerce platform, we're able to reduce the number of calls that come to our call centers. And things like that are going to reduce our costs over \u2013 both the second half of the year and as we look forward.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Okay, helpful. And then on the volume side, I think I went back to my model, I think this is the best volume number you've reported since 2004. And it doesn't sound like as you broke down the components that was really event driven. So, I realize the comps gets tougher as the year goes on, but can you talk about kind of the sustainability of these kinds of levels, closer to 3%? And should we \u2013 understand, you'll be above the guidance for the year, but should we expect that it could be kind of this strong as the year continues?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. What I would say, our volume \u2013 and Jim, you can add some color to this, too, but one thing that's pleasing to us about volume is that it's not just a big lump that we're seeing here. If you look at commercial volumes, commercial volumes have improved every quarter since Q2 of 2014, so a fairly long string of improvement that we're seeing. It's not as if we're seeing a big lump all in Q2.", "The roll-off business has been recently strong for the last seven quarters. Resi has shown \u2013 albeit still in the red, but resi has shown volume improvement for five consecutive quarters. And then, the landfills, Jim talked about MSW, C&D volumes being very strong, and special waste maybe being \u2013 the combination of special waste and revenue-generating cover was the lowest number on the page. And that one probably has some opportunity and we feel good about our special waste pipeline at this point.", "So, I think the fact that volume has been on this consistent upward trend is really the encouraging part for me. I'd be a little more concerned about it as being one-time if we saw a big blip in second quarter, but we really didn't. It's just been a gradual increase in all lines of business.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. Corey, the only \u2013 a couple of color items just I'd note. At landfill growth, we did get the benefit of that Virginia Waste-To-Energy Plant that was down. So, we received a pretty healthy amount of volume from it in the first half of the year. But even without that, as I mentioned, we still would have grown MSW volumes in that mid single-digit range. So, very healthy, given, as Jim pointed out, the economy situation. So, we're pleased with that. And you'll see \u2013 should see landfill volumes stay, again, without that one line item, in that mid single-digit range.", "Commercial volumes, we're net positive in both number and dollars on a sell/loss basis. So, our sales teams and customer service teams are all doing exceptionally well in that regard. And that'll help that permanent industrial or even commercial volume.", "The one reminder is that in the second half of last year, we added two pretty large national account customers that were almost exclusively commercial business. So the comps on the commercial side will get really difficult in the second half of the year. But excluding that large national account, you'll see the day-to-day commercial business continue to be strong.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Got it. Really helpful, and then just one last quick one is the tech question. As you talk about some of the things you can do with AI, for example, is that \u2013 build versus buy, are there third-party vendors who provide that or you expect to do that internally, or is that still TBD?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "No, there are third-party vendors. Technology for us encompasses a number of different items including things like, as you say, AI. AI is kind of a longer-term opportunity for us when we think about robotics or autonomy. I think in the short-term, what you're seeing is us spending our kind of innovative time on customer-facing technologies such as the ones that Jim mentioned, e-commerce and self-service, and then also on big data for the use in our pricing tools and in things like predictive maintenance and routing and logistics.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "And I'm just wondering if those kinds of data things could ultimately be a strategic \u2013 like a competitive advantage for you, maybe not relative to the other big players, relative to the mom and pops, enables you to price more intelligently or do maintenance more intelligently in a way that gives you a strategic cost or revenue advantage?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. I think you're right. I think it's \u2013 and I think you're also right that this eventually ends up being something that we see across the larger companies. But the smaller companies, it will be a differentiator for us. But we think we're the leader in the industry and in technology, and we continue to invest that way.", "We're spending somewhere between $100 million to $150 million in tax spend each year. We're putting somebody \u2013 a leader in that position, the Chief Technology Officer position, by the end of the year. So, we see technology as a differentiator for us within the industry, but I do think over the long-term, it probably ends up being more versus the smaller companies.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "And, Corey, one last point that I want to go back to your first question on the volume side. And just a reminder, as I did that national account comp problem for the second half of this year, we do have two less work days in the second half of this year than prior year. So, that permanent business like roll-off, the roll-off line of business, but also our landfill could be affected. But the trends and the absolute core nature of the business is still really positive. Those two items will have an impact on the second half volume. That's why big Jim mentioned that we are guiding you to the upper end of our range, which was I think 1.2% to 1.6% for the second half of the year, but still really strong.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Good news about fewer work days is, it actually is a positive for us on the bottom line. It just is not going to show up as a positive on a year-over-year comp basis in terms of absolutes. But on the bottom line, it ends up being a positive for us having fewer work days.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Is that, by the way, one day each in Q3 and Q4 or two in one of the quarters?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "It's like 1.7 days in Q4 and 0.3 days in Q3.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Great, very helpful. Thank you.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Credit Suisse.", "Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Hey, guys. Question on your free cash flow. So, you talked about you're going to do $500 million in repurchases this quarter, you did $250 million. Can you just remind us what's left in that authorization after that? And then, your leverage is at about 2.4 times. How do you feel about your leverage there? Would you guys be looking at taking on some debt, I think just given your healthy free cash flow at this point?", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "So, our authorization for the current year was $750 million. So, the $500 million that we'll spend in the third quarter will take us to 100% of that authorization. We'll continue to look at our free cash flow allocation as we discuss future authorizations with the board going forward. And we typically do that in the fourth quarter.", "Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Yeah.", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "With regard to our leverage, 2.4 times is low historically when you look at Waste Management, but what we focus on is the fact that that's a healthy balance sheet that positions us for opportunity. And so we don't anticipate that we're going to reduce our debt balances in absolute dollars, but you could see the leverage balance, or the leverage metric reduce over time as EBITDA continues to grow.", "We really see opportunistic balance sheet \u2013 a well-structured balance sheet as something that gives us opportunity to look for strategic M&A that's priced well. And we think that that combined with our free cash flow really positions us to execute upon that if it presents itself.", "Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay. And then, just given what you guys said about your M&A probably hitting the higher end of that $200 million spend, that would imply that you're just looking at some smaller type tuck-ins. But are you seeing anything opportunistic in terms of a larger-type deal?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "I mean, there are obviously a few of those than the tuck-ins. And once you get to larger deals, then we, because of our size, have to consider HSR filings and things like that. So, it's not to say that there aren't deals out there of larger size. They involve more efforts for us from a justice perspective. Doesn't mean they're not good. We've done three of them over the last four years. But for now, we're focused on those tuck-ins. And then, as those other opportunities present themselves, I think that's really Devina's point is that the balance sheet gives us the ability to do those. The $100 million to $200 million just comes out of free cash flow, but if you start thinking about bigger deals, you have a balance sheet that's able to easily absorb bigger deals.", "Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer.", "Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe we could start with the recycling line of business. So, obviously, the China policy, the notification to the WTO, that's all relatively recent. I wonder how do you think about the potential impact on the recycling business as a whole, maybe, in particular, the brokerage part of the business, because it does seem like what's going to be restricted, in particular, a certain categories of plastics. So not sure how that flows through to kind of the brokerage line of business. What do you think may change in terms of kind of the overall throughput going through that part of the business? And then, what might you have to do just in terms of reconfiguring the business to respond?", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. Noah, great question. Good timing for it. But remember that our brokerage business is almost entirely fiber and not plastics-related. So, we see no impact from a plastics standpoint on the brokerage business with China's action. It's really going to be a fiber and then some plastics, but, again, not brokerage-related. It's because of the way we sort the mixed paper and we do it today. We sort every bit of the mixed paper we receive. We don't see a material impact to what we export on that side. And that's one of their real focus is. The other are plastics that are out of the norm. It's not a large part of what we export.", "So, we, as of now, don't see a significant impact to either part of that business, but that's still to be determined. It looks like China is really trying to help, from an environmental standpoint. It's not just related to recycle tools, but they're looking to help their internal businesses, probably perhaps to reduce or to manage price a little bit, but also to clean up some of the imported materials that they receive. Given what we do and what we see today, we just don't see a significant impact. Yet, as I mentioned, we're not ready to forecast price until we see \u2013 have a little more clarity into Q3.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "But they are the \u2013 Jim, China is the big buyer in the market. So, when they start tinkering with policies that could impact commodity prices, we have to be increasingly aware of that.", "Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "And so just in terms of how we think about the outlook for the rest of the year, are you assuming sort of a more kind of normalized dip in OCC prices? I mean, obviously, we're at elevated levels now. How should we think about kind of how you're thinking about the pricing environment?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yes. It's hard to predict. I wish I had a crystal ball here because, remember, back at the end of Q1, we had just finished with a really good quarter. And all of a sudden, China comes out and does something kind of crazy, and prices for OCC dropped to 25% or 30% in a period of a week. So, it is -", "Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Right.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "And we don't have a lot of ability to hedge ourselves there. The markets are pretty thinly traded. So, it's a bit hard to predict. What I would say though about the back half of the year with respect to commodity prices is that comparisons do get more difficult, particularly as you get into Q4. Last year, you may recall that we talked about the normal kind of seasonal decline in commodity prices that you tend to see from Q3 to Q4, and that we did not see in 2016. I'm not sure that we are expecting a repeat of that. I think you probably will see it as a normal seasonal decline in commodity prices after they've done all of their kind of Christmas and holiday buying.", "So, we think that Q4, in particular, has more difficult comps on commodity prices, but the rest of businesses doing so well and even the recycling business on the cost side is doing so well that we're still very comfortable with going to the top end of our range, as we mentioned earlier.", "Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Great, great. Thanks. And if I could just sneak one more in? Jim, you mentioned at the outset, you will be looking to bring on a Chief Technology Officer by the end of the year. It seems as though there are already a number of internal improvement initiatives related to technology under way. You mentioned the e-commerce platform, these predictive maintenance efforts. Maybe just if we could better understand kind of what the type of profile of that person coming in might look like and really what their provenance is going to be over the next several years? Are they \u2013 is this person more kind of geared to some of these longer term initiatives around robotics automation? Just how should we better think about that as aligning with the company's strategic initiatives?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. It's a good finishing question there. I would tell you, we're not looking for a Chief Information Officer. We're not looking for somebody to come in and who has a strong \u2013 necessarily a strong IT background to come in and look at things like data structures and systems integrations and things like that.", "We think we have a really good team internally to do that, and we're in the process of doing that already. We're in the process of consolidating data. We're in the process of looking where we have data overlap and making sure that we establish data consistency and eliminating some of our applications where we have multiple applications that sometimes do the same thing.", "So, we're not necessarily looking in this new Chief Technology Officer for a more traditional Chief Information Officer. We're looking for somebody that has an understanding of \u2013 if not our business directly, an understanding of this type of routing or logistics-type business in general that also can bring some innovation to bear on those newer types of technologies \u2013 not just data, we've talked a lot about data, but as you mentioned, robotics technology, and then longer term working with our organic growth group on things like autonomy. I mean, we think that autonomy is \u2013 particularly as we think about the collection side of our business is a longer term aspiration for us because while the technology is moving forward, there is a big difference between where the technology is and where the public perception and government regulation is.", "But all of those we do think will eventually come to our industry. In the near-term, we're going to be focusing this person more on those customer-facing technologies, e-commerce and self-service, and then better use of data to make us as efficient as we can be.", "Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thanks so much for the color.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thanks. I guess I'm going to have to say big Jim and little Jim and Devina. Is that what I heard, Jim Trevathan?", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "I've been called worse.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. The waste energy volume that was going to a landfill in Virginia, is that stock coming?", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "No. It hasn't, Michael. If we had to crystal ball it today, end of September, middle of September, early in, but that depends obviously on them getting back online out of our .", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Got it. And then, I am absolute believer that your solid waste \u2013 underlying fundamental solid waste business you've been saying it had margin expansion. So, bear with me, this is a little bit laborious. But if I took $3.677 billion of revenues and subtract that $375 million and take $1.29 billion of EBITDA and subtract that $48 million, that's taking it all out, that's a 29.7% margin. If I do the same thing on the prior year, you're at 29.04%. Do you disagree with any of that?", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "I can tell you that I -", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Conceptually.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "You're giving us a lot of credit for following all those numbers -", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yes. I can't tell you that I followed the numbers specifically, but I can tell you that the 70 basis point improvement is the number that we have calculated internally. So that math seems to work for us.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. I mean, the important statement is that you have real-life, honest-to-goodness leverage, but another way to look at it is you grew revenue 7.4%, you grew free cash flow \u2013 you grew EBITDA 7.8%, so there's 40 basis points there. You grew free cash flow even stronger. So, whether the absolute margin of the whole company reports more than more narrow impressions, there's more leverage here than people appreciate. That's why the cash conversation is so important.", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "Absolutely.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Well, that's why, Michael, in all of our scripts, we spend a lot of time talking about cash today because it is \u2013 you're absolutely right, I mean, the cash \u2013 the conversion here is impressive. And so, not only is the conversion price, but the absolute numbers themselves. That's why I talked about revenue growing at 7.4%. I mean, all of these numbers are kind of 2, 3, 4 times the overall economy. But you're absolutely right, the conversion is impressive. But the margins \u2013 and we didn't want to lose sight of that, the margin strength of the business is there. It just was masked a little bit by \u2013 in particular, by these two items that Jim talked about, which was the brokerage side of our business and the loss of the tax credit.", "It's, Michael, why I went through that brokerage business and the recycling business overall is to clearly show not just its impact on margin and how great, I think, the core business is operating, but it's also to show us all that there's value in that recycling and commodity \u2013 or brokerage side of that business to the overall network.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Got it. Okay. So, now, to be fair and balanced about this, at 1.9% reported price, that's below your own internal inflation. So, help me understand where \u2013 either that total reported number can go or how I should look at the mix of that number, this is around the solid waste business, to appreciate that you're not fighting a spread to your own internal inflation, which is probably somewhere between 2% and 2.5%.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Well, so, keep in mind, first of all, we said we'd be a 2% yield company and we're at 1.9%. So, we're pretty darn close. But keep in mind that the yield calculation really is \u2013 and you know this, but the yield calculation is a unit rate comparison that includes the impact on unit rate of new business.", "So, by definition, when you bring new business on, and we're obviously bringing new business on when you look at our volume numbers, it has a dampening effect on unit rate comps. I mean, no matter how good that business is, and our sales team, and led by Jim and all of his lieutenants, when they look at new business, they are very much looking at bringing good new business on, but the fact of the matter is that that new business has not gone through a price increase. And we have customers that have been with us for 10, 15 years that have gone through a price increase every year.", "So, by definition, that new business will have a dampening effect on unit rate comps, which is why we focus on not just yield, but we focus on core price. We think core price is probably \u2013 well, not probably, is a far better representation of the price increases that we take on our core business and the rollbacks and the fees, and that, to us, is the best kind of corollary, I guess, to what's happening with our cost structure. You're right, our cost structure is going up more than 1.9%, but our core price has gone up by 4.7%.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. Michael, you just take \u2013 Jim said, new business that he mentioned, you just look at the increased revenue, even take the brokerage side out or the recycling out, and Jim's 4.1% revenue growth that he mentioned, excluding that commodity issue. Just with that growth alone, there's an impact to yield because we are increasing current customers, not increasing those new customers until they anniversary after a year. So, it's just a mathematical issue that's going to reduce yield to some extent because of the revenue growth.", "The other couple of just factoids about it, almost 70% of our locations had greater than 2% yield and they overcame that. It's a mix issue in a few of our areas that struggled in that quarter, but not related to a business strategy issue, just pure mix issue. If you look at our new business, both commercial and industrial new business came on at a higher unit rate than previous year's quarter. Our lost business was up slightly on the industrial side. That's that mix issue. It had a impact to yield, but every line of business had an average unit rate on a same-store basis higher than the previous year's quarter.", "So, we have not taken our eye off of yield or price strategy, when you look at that 3.2% volume. In fact, it's just the opposite. We are executing core price above our internal and our external targets. And that's how we measure ourselves.", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "And, Michael, I think \u2013 part of the conversation with flow-through of that revenue growth through to the bottom line, whether it be the EBITDA measures or the free cash flow measures. And so, what you can see is that this volume growth is coming in with very strong flow-through in both the collection and landfill lines of business and providing revenue growth that is so accretive from a margin expansion perspective and generating a free cash flow conversion that we expect.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. So, just so I summarize, one of the things I'm hearing, which is what I hope, is that you are participating and possibly even gaining share against new business growth that is coming in at an incremental unit of measure greater than historically, but it has dampened the overall. And that's how we should think about it is the power of the new business growth.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "That is exactly right.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "And as \u2013 when we were losing volume, and without a lot of new business growth years ago, that it helped that yield calculation, but it didn't help the business. We are helping the business by focusing on both core price, executing that plan, and growing volume on a disciplined basis. You see that in the flow-through, both free cash and in EBITDA.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. On the technology side, when you think about dynamic routing and you look at it today, what do you think the potential to either measures, things like number of miles driven, how much could be reduced or total hours \u2013 operating hours of the trucks reduced because of the success of what a dynamic routing system could do. And over the long haul, this is going to come in small bites, I understand, steady improvement. What's the scope of something like that, or on predictive maintenance, thinking about \u2013 I'm assuming it's about avoiding the unscheduled downtime, which leads to labor increases and increase in R&M inflation, but I also think it has to do with these aftermarket parts or OEM parts as the aftermarket's cheaper, but do you replace it more often, all that kind of stuff. Help me understand some of that.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah, I would tell you, Michael, I'm not sure we've fully quantified the number to be able to answer your question sufficiently. What I will say about both technology on dynamic routing and on maintenance is this. I'll talk to maintenance first. We do think that when you have to reactively repair a vehicle, it's probably 1.5 to 2 times as expensive as proactively repairing it, because when you have a vehicle breakdown on the road, you've got other costs in there. You simply don't have \u2013 you don't have towing cost if you're proactively repairing it. You don't have the overtime cost for the driver. You don't have a \u2013 and by the way, that 1.5 to 2 times does not include the impact to the customer. So, while we haven't gone through and quantified that impact yet on more of a macro basis, we do believe that moving much more towards predictive or proactive, however you want to talk about it, maintenance is a big efficiency and cost improver for us.", "And then on to routing and logistics, we talked about routing and logistics a lot over the last of couple of years with our SDO initiative, but most of the improvement that we've made has been on the front-end of the day and the back-end of the day for the driver. So, the front-end of the day being their pre-trip and the back-end of the day being their post-trip, we really believe we have established almost complete unanimity there within our systems, that being our districts. But within the middle of the day, which is the route itself, only about 30% of our routes are truly dynamically routed. And so we feel like we've got some real opportunity left within our routing and logistics to pick up some incremental dollars.", "As you recall, a couple of years ago, we valued that at about $100 million improvement. So, when we started talking about this maybe four years ago, we thought it was about $100 million in improvement that we would get from routing and logistics. And so we've certainly seen a piece of that with the improvement in the pre-trip and the post-trip, but we think there still is opportunity.", "I would tell you, we're kind of in the ninth inning or at the end of the game with respect to \u2013 maybe we're never at the end of the game, but we're in the ninth inning with respect to the pre-trip and post-trip. We're still in the fifth inning or the fourth inning with respect to pulling the most efficiencies out of the route itself.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Michael, I would \u2013 just a couple of comments there. I mean, we had to go through all of that effort to put onboard computers on every truck and create the management team at the local level that can handle that information and can try to begin to then manage through process their way through that to get to middle of the route improvements. So, that's done. Our districts, right now, 98% do certify that they have the mindset and the skill set in place and are getting efficiency.", "We had another quarter where the three lines of business, when you combine them, had positive efficiency. I think that's eight or nine in a row now of quarters on a combined basis that are efficient. We haven't had that in a long time. So, we started with that onboard computer. We measure \u2013 as you brought out, we measure miles per route at the local level, at the national level, at the area level today by line of business and are starting to see improvement. But it is the execution in the middle of the day that'll bring that on, and there's some technology that we're looking at adding that's not huge dollars. This is just taking what we have and leveraging it better to get more efficiency improvement than what we've had, but it's part of that margin impact was the efficiency that we've already begun to see.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then lastly on autonomous vehicle, just to put this in perspective. I mean, we're a long way from having a local government having define the rules that would allow a 24-ton residential truck to go down the road. So, that the early wins here might be in off-road applications like inside a transfer station or landfill compaction equipment before we see a commercial vehicle going down on a res \u2013 and it's probably only residential collection this applies to anyway.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. That's right. I mean, look, we're working with...", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "... both heavy equipment and heavy truck manufacturing partners, but it's really on an R&D basis. And in the short-term, we're going to test an autonomous vehicle in one of our landfills in one of our MRFs probably within the next 12 months. But as I mentioned, and you said as well, that putting an autonomous vehicle on a collection route and I would like to be a residential route, is a much longer term aspiration for us because of that public perception and government regulation.", "I mean, the technology I think is moving pretty quickly there, but public perception and government regulation have to catch up with that. And I just can't predict when that's going to happen. I think that's a longer term aspiration for us on our collection business.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Well, it's not unlike the airlines. I mean, the A380 or the \u2013 most of these airplanes can take off and land all by themselves. I'm not sure I'd get on the plane if I didn't think there was a pilot and a copilot sitting in the seat.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "You and I are in the same boat there.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Last question on recycling, does the China Certification & Inspection Group come and do site inspections for you, so this whole issue about the WTO, as it really relates to your business, is a whole lot about nothing, because, one, your quality is there with you process; two, you do on-site inspections, and therefore \u2013 and they need the paper. There's a true demand side for this. So, this is directed at Europe and the really bad quality that's been showing up. Basically, all the residuals are being bundled into the bales and sent over to China. And then, China has finally said, enough. And they try doing green fence sword and now they're doing it with the WTO.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "You're right on all fronts, Michael. The one caveat I would add is that we want to see what they have written and see it in action. But, yes, we do certify ourselves. We are authorized to certify that we are meeting the specs, and we expect that to continue right on all fronts.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "All right. And then, Devina, could you give us \u2013 what was your commodity bundle price in 2Q 2017 and then 3Q 2016, 4Q 2016, so we can understand that comparison, just to put in perspective? And my belief is there's this lower number than even what was 2Q 2017 is in guidance.", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "So, we were at about $130 a ton on an average basis in the first part of the year. I don't have last year's numbers at my fingertips, but Ed will be happy to get those to you.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Perfect. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Feniger with Bank of America.", "Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I think you said volumes \u2013 you mentioned how volumes are exceeding your full year goal. So, if you could remind us of what the full year goal on the volumes was? And you also said, I believe, core prices above your internal target. Since you're kind of coming in ahead of these internal targets, can you just give us the puts and takes of what's actually holding back the guide then?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "What's holding back the guidance? Is that what you said?", "Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yes. Yes, with the fact that the volumes and core price are actually turning ahead of your internal targets", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Well, so two things. One was, just to give you the numbers, the guidance for volume was 1.2% to 1.6%. And we said we'll be at the high end of that or above that actually, that 1.6%. And then, core price, I think, was 4% -", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Close to 4%.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "4%. So, I would tell you that with respect to guidance, as we said earlier, we are effectively raising guidance here because of the fact that we gave a range initially, and now we're saying we're not going to be in the range. When you give a range, it kind of implies that the middle is what your actual number is, but you're going to give yourself a little wiggle room on both sides. Now, by saying we'll be at the top end of that range, we have in effect raised guidance from the middle to the top.", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "And what I would point out is the fuel tax credits that we've talked about all year, that's a $0.04 impact on a year-over-year basis that was not included in our guidance for the year. So, that is an element of softness that we didn't anticipate. But if you back out the impact of the impairment and the fuel tax credit on the second quarter, our EPS growth was 12% on a year-over-year basis. So, we certainly are happy with the performance. And as Jim said, $3.18 EPS target for the year is definitely an optimistic view compared to where we started this year when we set guidance.", "Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "That helps. That makes sense. And even with the $3.18, I think that implies the second half of the year should contribute around 56% to your full year EPS \u2013 sorry, it contributes around 53%, 54%. I think I'm going to go back to 2010, the second half is closer to 56%, 57%. Is there just anything we should be aware of like the waiting of second half that maybe it's a little lighter this year than it is in the last prior five years? Is it with recycling perhaps? I'm just trying to get an idea of how to think about that.", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "Well, we certainly \u2013 it's interesting because we look at that same math. And when we look at 2017 and how it compares to 2016, the year-over-year comparison, you're spot on that it's most difficult in doing that math and just applying it consistently on a year-over-year basis, is the recycling impacts that we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. And the recycling benefits have been more heavily weighted toward the first half of this year. And so, it's difficult to just apply that math in the current year without adjusting for the recycling impact.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Exactly. It just wouldn't be accurate, especially the fourth quarter where the comps will not be anywhere near the same as the first two and even third quarter. The comp will be very difficult for Q4 for recycling commodity prices.", "Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. That makes sense. And then just my last question. Obviously, there's a lot of conversations about significant M&A. Are you finding valuation multiples high or maybe too demanding? Is there any view internally that you guys are willing to perhaps wait on the sidelines and just have the strongest balance sheet in the industry when the cycle turns down, and maybe focus more on returning cash through dividends and repurchasing, and just wait on the sidelines if the multiple is too high?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. I mean, I think we've done some waiting. I don't think we really changed our approach, though. Our approach has been that we want to be \u2013 that whoever we look at as an acquisition candidates for us, it has to be properly priced based on our analysis and then it has to be the right strategic business for us to acquire. And that's been our approach for as long as I've been here in Houston.", "To answer your first question, our expectation is high. I would say they might be a little higher. I'm not sure they're high. I think they're a little higher just because you've seen our multiples creep up. The big three, within our industry, multiples have crept up a little bit.", "And so, as a consequence, some of these folks that we're looking to acquire are not blind to that. But that doesn't change our approach, which is that we want \u2013 we want these companies to meet or exceed our expectations from a financial perspective.", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "And we continue to prioritize return on invested capital when we make those decisions.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Right.", "Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Perfect. And just lastly, I mean, you mentioned a lot about the trend you're seeing in Q2 and the strength. Just quickly, has that continued through to July?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "You're talking about volume or -", "Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yes. Yes. Like volume, C&D, and what you guys are seeing there. Have you felt like the trends have continued through to July?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. We're pleased with July margins so far.", "Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Perfect. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital.", "Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Thanks for sneaking me in. Just one quick one. Your internalization of waste percentage went up, and I think it's the highest we've seen in a couple of years. Can you just give us a little bit more color how you're getting there and how high you think that'll go? Thanks.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. When I looked at internalization earlier, we were \u2013 it's pretty much the same number. And that being that the \u2013 when we think about internalization, is the percentage that we \u2013 actually, that we collect, that we didn't turn around and take to our sites is about 66.5%. And it's been in that 66% range since as far back as I was looking, which was 2010. So, it hasn't changed dramatically.", "Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. I'll follow-up offline. Thanks so much.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. Okay.", "Operator", "At this time, we have no further questions. And I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jim Fish.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Thank you. Producing these levels of organic growth in almost every financial metric that are 2, 3, even 4 times the overall growth of North American economies can only be done through the collective efforts of our team of 42,000 people. And every day that passes for me in this CEO job, I'm more and more amazed by this team's dedication, innovation, work ethic, and their willingness to change. So, thank you to all of Waste Management's 42,000 team members for this performance. And thank you to all of you for joining us this morning.

Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Thanks, Ed. And thank you, all, for joining us this morning. 2017 was arguably the best year we've seen as we exceeded expectations on all of our operational and financial metrics. About one year ago, I mentioned that each of our operating income, operating EBITDA, and net cash provided by operating activities were at all-time highs. I'm very pleased to say that, in 2017, we exceeded those highs and set new records in each of those metrics. Our continued focus on improving core price, adding profitable volume in a disciplined manner, and controlling costs produced $3.22 of EPS, another year of double-digit improvements with EPS improving more than 10%.", "In addition, operating income margin and operating EBITDA margin both achieved all-time highs. Our operating EBITDA exceeded $4 billion for the first time and we achieved free cash flow conversion close to 45%. During 2017, we generated strong free cash flow that allowed us to return $1.5 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases.", "We continue to see solid growth in the cash generation capability of our business. The success that we achieved in 2017 sets the foundation for continued growth into 2018 and beyond. For the full year, our strong growth in EPS, operating EBITDA and free cash flow is driven by solid growth in revenue.", "Revenues increased $876 million, or 6.4%. This is the best revenue dollar increase that we've seen since 1998. And more importantly, the majority of the increase is organic price and volume. For the full year, our collection and disposal core price was 4.8% with yield of 2%. In 2017, total company volume for the year was 2.3%, marking the first time in this cycle that we've exceeded 2% volume for the full year.", "In 2017, we continue to focus on improving price and growing high-margin volumes, all while delivering exceptional customer service. Our strong results reinforced our conviction that these are the right areas to focus on. And we look forward to continued progress into 2018.", "For 2018, we expect EPS to be between $3.97 and $4.05 and free cash flow to be between $1.95 billion and $2.05 billion. Before turning the call over to Jim and Devina, I want to point out our recent 8-K filings for those of you who may have not seen it.", "Jim Trevathan, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and Jeff Harris, our Senior Vice President of our Northern Tier Operations, both announced their plans to retire at the end of this year. Both Jim and Jeff have made tremendous contributions to the success of Waste Management throughout their distinguished careers and we have an excellent succession planning process which has produced a very solid group of internal succession candidates.", "The strength of that group was demonstrated by our recent promotion of Tara Hemmer to Senior Vice President of Operations, Safety and Environmental Compliance. As we approach Jim and Jeff's retirement date, we will provide additional details on our succession plans. But suffice it to say, our operations are in excellent leadership hands today and will continue to be in the future.", "I will now turn the call over to Jim and Devina to further discuss our fourth quarter results and our 2018 guidance in more detail. And I will conclude with a brief strategic commentary on 2018 and beyond following their comments.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Thanks, Jim, and good morning. In the fourth quarter, our business continued to drive income from operations and operating EBITDA growth. We saw both price and volume in our traditional solid waste business exceed 2% for the third consecutive quarter. As a result, total company income from operations grew $61 million, an increase of almost 10%. And income from operations margin expanded 80 basis points to 18.6% when compared to last year. Our operating EBITDA grew $90 million, an increase of 9.7% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. And our operating EBITDA margin expanded 100 basis points to 27.9% when compared to last year. Revenues in the fourth quarter were $3.65 billion, an increase of $192 million, or 5.5%, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.", "The growth in revenues was predominantly driven by our collection and disposal business from the combined impact of price and volume of $172 million. Fourth quarter revenues were negatively impacted by lower recycling commodity prices and lower volumes, which drove a $25 million decline in recycling revenues.", "In the fourth quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.8% and yield was 2.2%. On the volume front, total volume was 3.4% and traditional solid waste volume was up 5%. Volumes in the fourth quarter benefited by about 140 basis points from hurricane cleanup in Texas and Florida, and 60 basis points from increased volumes from the new Los Angeles franchise collection and the new New York City disposal contracts.", "Looking at other revenue metrics, service increases exceeded service decreases for the 16th consecutive quarter, and new business continued to exceed lost business for the 11th consecutive quarter. Our churn increased in the recent quarter due to the transitioning of accounts related to the new City of Los Angeles franchise contract, but remember that the contract result in a net gain of customers with this new franchise.", "Excluding the expected churn from these customers, our churn rate was 9.7% in the fourth quarter, a 30 basis point sequential improvement. For a density-based business like ours, we have historically measured churn based upon the number of customer locations, and we will continue to do so.", "However, if you look at churn on a revenue basis, it was 7.7% excluding the churn from the City of Los Angeles contract. With strong improvements in our quality of service metrics and our focus on providing customers with a differentiated offering, we expect continued improvement in all these metrics.", "Our collection lines of business continued to perform exceptionally well. In the fourth quarter, commercial core price was 6.5%, with volume up 2.5%. Industrial core price was 9.4%, with volume up 5.9% in the fourth quarter.", "In the residential line of business, core price was 3.2%, while residential volume was down 2.1% in the fourth quarter similar to the third quarter. The combined price and volume increase in our collection line of business led to income from operations growing $39 million.", "In the landfill line of business, total volume increased 18.7% aided by increased volumes from the hurricane cleanup in Florida and Texas. More specifically, MSW volume grew 12%, C&D volume grew 23.6%, and combined special waste and revenue generating cover volume grew 4.5%.", "On the MSW front, we saw strong volumes in our base volumes, which were up 10.4%. We continued to benefit from an outage at our Virginia waste-to-energy plant, which added another 160 basis points to our MSW volumes. Our C&D volume increase included the impact of the California wildfire cleanup. Excluding that cleanup, our C&D volume was still a robust 10.7% in the fourth quarter.", "Regarding pricing, we achieved core price of 2.5% in the landfill line of business and MSW yield was 2%. The combined positive price and volume led to total income from operations growing $49 million or more than 16%, and operating EBITDA growing $74 million or more than 18% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.", "We also saw income from operations margin in the landfill line increase 110 basis points and operating EBITDA margin increased 230 basis points, including 100 basis points from hurricane cleanup. For the full year 2018, we expect to see the same strong price and volume results that we saw in 2017, with core price projected to be 4% or greater and yield of 2% or greater.", "In addition, we expect total company volumes to grow in the range of between 2% and 2.2% for the full year in 2018, consistent with the volume results that we achieved in 2017.", "Looking at our recycling business, in the fourth quarter, average recycling commodity prices declined 8.1% and volume declined 2.9%, as we saw the impact of China canceling import licenses or delaying the renewal of import licenses to their mills. As we anticipated in October, the decline in price and volume and the cost impact of meeting the new quality control standards impacted EPS by a negative $0.03 in the fourth quarter when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.", "When we gave preliminary guidance for the recycling business in October, we expected recycling to have a negative $0.04 per share impact in 2018. Since then, China did not grant any import licenses until the end of December and those they did grant were fewer in number with lower volumes than expected. The contamination limit that China proposed of 0.5% is now expected to be strictly enforced, which will result in continued increased costs. OCC remains under continued pricing pressure, as we currently see in the first quarter. Based upon these factors, we now expect our recycling operations to have a negative $0.08 to $0.10 per share impact on 2018 EPS, weighted to the first half of 2018.", "Moving now to operating expenses. In the fourth quarter, total operating costs increased $116 million when compared with the fourth quarter of 2017. The cost increases were largely due to increased volumes leading to higher collection, repair and maintenance costs, and fuel expenses.", "Our operating expenses, as a percentage of revenue, improved 10 basis points from 62.1% in the fourth quarter of 2016 to 62% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Efficiency gains and other cost control effort, particularly in the labor and transfer and disposal cost lines, more than offset increased costs at our recycling facilities and the higher fuel expenses of 75 basis points as a percent of revenue.", "So, in summary, our traditional solid waste business improved operating expenses as a percent of revenue by 120 basis points during the quarter, thanks to the strong execution of our field and corporate team.", "And finally, on a personal note, and as Jim mentioned, I am retiring at the end of 2018. I believe our company is in great hands moving forward. Our senior leaders, corporate and field, are as aligned on our strategy as we have ever been in my tenure with the company. I'm proud to say that we've worked diligently at developing and aligning our field and our corporate leadership teams, and I believe we have the best group of field leaders in our history.", "As you all know, I've had the privilege of working with Jim Fish, both at corporate and in the field, and I know him well. When our board chose Jim as CEO over a year ago, from my perspective as a member of the senior team and as the largest internal shareholder in our company, I was very pleased. Jim and the board asked me to stay for a couple of years after that transition and I welcome that opportunity and I appreciated their confidence.", "Jeff Harris and I have been a part of this business for a long time. He and I both believe that after we retire, the superb leadership here at corporate and in the field are more than ready to move Waste Management to the next level of success.", "Along with the Jim's extensive experience in the field and in corporate, we have leaders like John Morris and Tara Hemmer with decades of operations experience. And, of course, with people like Devina and Chuck, who are here in the room today, my other colleagues on the senior leadership team, including our corporate department heads, the company is in excellent hands today and in the future.", "My decision regarding the timing is based solely on two beliefs. First, the future leadership is in place and will succeed. Second, after 39 years with the company, it's time to move to spend more time with my wonderful wife of almost 46 years.", "She deserves it and I desire it. And also, more time with our 10 grandkids. Well, I desire that and I trust they will as well. Rene (18:56) and I have many goals, otherwise, that we want to accomplish outside of family and our company as we transition to what's next for us.", "But please remember, as I have reminded members of our WM family, I have 10.5 months remaining to create value for our customers, our people, and our shareholders, and I plan to sprint to the finish line. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to further discuss our financial results and guidance.", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In 2017, our strong operating results helped us to achieve our financial priorities of converting more of each revenue dollar to cash from operations, growing free cash flow, and then allocating that cash flow to grow our business and provide value to our shareholders.", "In the fourth quarter of 2017, we generated $790 million of cash from operations, that's an increase of almost 5% from the prior-year period. Full year cash from operations was $3.18 billion in 2017, an increase of over 8% if we adjust 2016 for the $67 million swap termination benefit. Our cash flow from operations as a percentage of revenue grew 40 basis points from the prior year to 22%. But more importantly, we demonstrated that the 350 basis point increase in this metric, when compared to our long-term average, is sustainable.", "We are going to continue to focus on the operating efficiencies, cost control, and working capital management efforts to not just maintain but grow this metric in the years ahead. We generated $342 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2017, that's a $46 million decline from the fourth quarter of 2016. We, again, saw a strong growth in our operating EBITDA. And so, the year-over-year decrease was due entirely to a $151 million increase in our capital spending in the fourth quarter.", "This increase was planned, allowing us to realize permanent tax benefits from asset placed in service in 2017, but more importantly, to support the business growth that we've been experiencing. For the full year, we generated $1.77 billion of free cash flow, an increase of $60 million from 2016 and above the high-end of our revised guidance for the year. The strong and consistent free cash flow we generate supports our focus on returning value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and also growing the business by funding acquisitions.", "In the fourth quarter, we paid $184 million in dividends and spent $120 million on tuck-in acquisitions. As Jim mentioned, for the full year, we returned $1.5 billion to our shareholders, growing our dividend for the 14th consecutive year and spending the full $750 million of share repurchase authorization to buyback over 9.7 million shares of our stock. We also spent $200 million on acquisitions, which was at the high-end of our plan for the year.", "Turning to SG&A. For the fourth quarter of 2017, SG&A was $369 million, a $9 million decrease from the prior-year period. As a percent of revenue, SG&A costs were 10.1% for both the fourth quarter of 2017 and the full year. When looking at the full year, this is the best SG&A margin we have seen since 2005 and a 30 basis point improvement from 2016. In 2018, we expect SG&A expenses to be approximately $1.5 billion and we continue to target SG&A as a percent of revenue of about 10%.", "Before turning to our guidance for 2018, I want to spend some time talking about tax reform, which will certainly benefit our earnings and cash flows in future years but it also had about $530 million net positive impact on our 2017 earnings and balance sheet as we re-measured our deferred tax liabilities and estimated the costs of a one-time deemed repatriation of our stimulated Canadian earnings.", "We excluded this net benefit of $1.21 per share from our as-adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter and full year. After this adjustment, our recurring effective tax rate for 2017 was about 36%, which was slightly below our expected rate. With tax reform, we expect our recurring effective rate to decline by 10 to 11 percentage points in the year ahead to about 26%, making this a clear benefit to the future earnings and cash flows of our business. The reduction in our effective rate is less than the 14% decrease in the corporate rate due primarily to a decrease in the benefit of the deduction of state taxes, a modest increase in state rates, and then the non-deductibility of certain costs.", "We estimate that the lower rate will reduce our cash taxes by about $275 million from what we would have otherwise expected to pay in 2018. We see corporate tax reform as a positive step for the U.S. economy for the long term, and an opportunity to continue to invest in our employees and our operations.", "The reduction in cash taxes will certainly bolster the company's free cash flow growth immediately, but we will also focus on investing a portion of these tax savings to grow our business in the long run as the economy continues to grow.", "So, as we think about our guidance in 2018, we project that our operating EBITDA will increase to $4.2 billion to $4.25 billion. This guidance includes the impact of our previously announced plan to pay approximately $65 million in bonuses at the end of 2018 to our hardworking employees who do not get the opportunity to participate in our salaries incentive plan, as well as the $55 million to $65 million headwind we currently expect in the recycling line of business.", "We expect that this strong operating EBITDA growth will in turn drive free cash flow of between $1.95 billion and $2.05 billion, that's an increase of about 10% to 15% compared with 2017. We expect our capital expenditures to increase by $100 million to $200 million in 2018, as we make incremental investments to support business growth and invest in our fleet. This will put us temporarily above our long-term stated range for capital expenditures of 9% to 10% of revenue. But as we demonstrated in 2017, we are making this incremental investment in a disciplined way to provide accretive returns and drive long-term EBITDA and cash flow growth.", "With this strong growth in free cash flow, we expect to, again, increase the cash allocated to shareholders in 2018. Our board continues to demonstrate conviction in the cash generation of our business as evidenced by the intended 9.4% increase in our per share dividend for 2018 and then the authorization to repurchase up to $1.25 billion of our shares.", "This is the largest increase in our per share dividend in a decade and a $500 million increase in the share repurchase authorization from the prior year. We remain committed to returning value directly to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, but we also see value in complementing our organic growth with tuck-in acquisitions.", "We continue to have the strongest balance sheet in the industry, finishing 2017 with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.4 times, positioning us well to make strategic acquisitions at the right price.", "I will now turn the call back over to Jim.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Thanks, Devina. Devina discussed the impact of corporate tax reform on our 2018 cash taxes and the use of a portion of those dollars for the $2,000 bonus to 34,000 of our employees, and some incremental capital spending on the fleet in 2018.", "Long term, however, our strategic focus will include our people, our technology including our fleet, recycling for the future, and growth of the business both organically and through acquisition.", "In a company where a large percentage of our 42,000 jobs are hourly, skilled positions with a manual component to them, our people must be given a lead position in our strategic objectives list for the long term.", "It's no secret that the millennial generation is not gravitating towards the skilled trade careers the way the baby boomers and the Gen Xers did. With that in mind, a big part of our people strategy is to design a 21st century approach to hiring, training, leadership development, and retention.", "An important component of our strategic approach to our people is to encourage our employees to stay and make a full career with Waste Management. Our $2,000 bonus was a first step in that process and we will continue to analyze the impact of turnover on our operations and our financials to be able to evaluate the merits of a retention program beyond 2018.", "On the fleet and technology front, we're driving our strategic fleet replacement program more quickly as we standardized the fleet across the company to reduce maintenance and operating costs and improve our service offering to our customers.", "In addition, our new digital team is hard at work, building a comprehensive digital strategy that includes projects that greatly improve our customers' digital experience.", "The ultimate outcome of our fleet and our digital strategies is the creation and accommodation of top-line and bottom-line growth through continuous improvements within our fleet operations and differentiation of our overall customer experience through technology.", "As a management team, we've been giving much thoughts to our recycling business in the future. Our customers expect us to provide recycling services to help them meet their sustainability goals, and we believe our management team, our network of recycling plants, and our valuable brokerage business distinguish Waste Management from all others. Over the last several years, we've proactively re-tooled our contracts by removing floor pricing, adding contamination and processing fees, and streamlining processing operations.", "Now, with the recent steps taken by China to strictly enforce its new quality control standards for recycled commodities which, we believe, are here to stay, we have an opportunity to build a recycle plant of the future that will provide solid, less volatile returns for our shareholders, meet the quality control requirements of our mill customers and continue to provide a sustainable recycling outlet for our customers.", "Building that plant of the future will involve, among many things, partnering with our OEMs to innovate on next-generation equipment that can improve processing times, throughput and, ultimately, produce a higher-quality product. We're currently piloting a fully robotic sort line. Depending upon the outcome of our pilots, our plan would be to move from test to production in the next few years.", "And lastly, as part of our strategic growth plan, we will continue to invest in acquisition opportunities that surpass our return criteria and create value for our shareholders. With more companies now meeting our hurdle rate of return due to the lower corporate tax rate, the primary determining factor as to whether we add to our normal annual acquisition guidance of $100 million to $200 million will be the extent to which sellers' expectations may have changed. Rest assured, though, what won't change is our financial discipline with those acquisitions.", "In summary, 2017 was a very successful year for Waste Management and we expect that 2018 will be just as successful as we stay focused on our strategy. Our employees are hard at work on executing our 2018 plans, which should position us to continue to grow our earnings and cash flow in 2018 and beyond. We have the best employees in the industry and I want to thank each member of the Waste Management team for our success.", "And with that, Theresa, let's open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Good morning, Tyler.", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "Morning.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey, Jim. So, really strong on the guide on the volume side, but I think you mentioned LA and New York were additive in Q4, but can you talk about how much in the 2018 guide both of those contracts will add?", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah, Tyler, Jim Trevathan. They will add some volume. They obviously will roll forward. But it's, I don't know, 10 basis points or so basis points, in that vicinity 20 basis points.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "It's not huge. Our base core business is doing very well, Tyler, and we expect that to continue into 2018. But they're there and they're helping, but New York City, for example, will not be up full speed until the fourth quarter of 2018 as they continue to move volume from current locations through those MTSs. So, that won't hit until late in the year, the full...", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "...strength of New York City volume.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Perfect. And then, how much do you expect Fairfax to be a drag as that plant comes back online?", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "About the same; about 10, 20 basis points. We'll get you more firm numbers, but it's in that vicinity.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay, okay. That's okay. And then, on the $200 million in tuck-ins, pretty strong this year, really strong number in Q4, but anyway you guys could talk about kind of what maybe the internal hurdle rates are, or maybe EBITDA multiple on the capital that was deployed this year?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. I mean, look, we don't normally talk about our hurdle rate. I mean, I think, though, as I said in my remarks, that we do think that more companies will now hit that hurdle rate because when you think about NOPAT, I mean, the key portion of that...", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Right.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "...has obviously changed. So, I think the big question in our mind as we think about our normal kind of $100 million to $200 million, Tyler, is what happens to seller expectations, because I think the pool is a bit broader now. We will have more candidates out there that meet our return requirements. And so, then the question becomes what happens to sellers' expectations with things like individual income tax reform.", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "But I think you can look \u2013 Tyler, I would just add that I think you can look at our return on invested capital as a good indication of how we think of hurdle rates. As we talked about for many years, we intend to invest the capital that we have available to us through our free cash flow in a way that's accretive. And so, our return on invested capital growth over the last few years, because we're acquiring business and investing capital in a way that will continue to create growth for the return on invested capital over the years ahead.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Right. Okay. And then to be clear, though, there's about $100 million to $200 million of M&A assumed in the guide, is that correct?", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "So, we've talked about $100 million to $200 million as our annual target. As Jim mentioned, we've got the balance sheet, we are well-positioned in order to allocate that and then some in the year ahead, but it's going to be largely dependent upon whether we can get transactions done in a disciplined way, and whether seller expectations will align with our own view of value in this new environment.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And this is my last one. Jim Trevathan, this is a question for you. It's on the transportation side. So, there's a lot of talk about rising truckload rates here in 2018. I'm just curious if you can talk about how subcontract or hauling contracts really are structured? Do you guys buy on the spot? Do you buy it annually, or is it usually under some sort of like multiyear contract? Just curious on how some of the subcontractor expenses were?", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah, Tyler. They're primarily at least annual, in most cases, multiple year contracts when we commit, for example, moving volume from transfer stations into our landfills. So, no immediate impact. There may be, in many cases, fuel surcharges like we charge our customers that are impacted as fuel rates change, but overall, it's not a huge impact on a one-year basis.", "Over time, if we see the same trend happen, that'll occur, but we'll get that price back from our customers as we move \u2013 as our cost goes up for transportation, we're going to raise the pricing on disposal.", "Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. All right. Well, thanks, guys.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital.", "Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Good morning. The first question maybe for Jim Fish, if you could maybe \u2013 actually for Jim and Jim, maybe if you could just frame for us how much self-help is there in your portfolio? I know you mentioned churn and you can measure that at a few different ways, but how much room is there to improve churn going forward?", "And then, specifically also on working capital, it feels like the industry turns cash a lot faster than you guys. Is there any self-help in the portfolio going forward?", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah, Hamzah, I'll start with your churn question. As we've said on almost every one of these calls, we don't see an end to improving churn. It's one of the reasons that, as Jim mentioned, we're looking from a digital standpoint at improving our offering to customers to create more stickiness.", "It's the reason that we focused so heavily on a quality of service metric on the collection lines of business. We see opportunity in churn whether it's on a revenue basis, as I mentioned, or on a number of customer locations like we've historically measured churn, there's continued opportunity. We haven't put a number to it and it's not a guidance topic that we're going to give you a guidance number on, but we're going to seek improvement every year in that metric.", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "And then. Hamzah, I would say, the same is true on the working capital front. You speak to the cash churn rate for our business as it compares to the rest of the industry and that's certainly something that we pay attention to. And you'll see in our 2017 results that we made good strides with regard to working capital, and we expect that those strides will continue to bear fruit in the year ahead.", "It's difficult to predict how quickly we can make changes. As an example, we got an additional day-and-a-half extension on our DPO in 2017. It'd be great to see that same results in the year ahead, but it's difficult to say that that's going to be what we target because, as you know, when you focus on continuous improvement, you tend to address the easier parts of change first and the parts that will provide the most value, the quickest first.", "And that's certainly the approach that we've been using. We're going to continue to move the needle, both on our DSO and our DPO in the year ahead, and that continuous improvement mindset is something that applies to all parts of our business. So, I guess, that sums it up with regard to your view of self-help, it's in the guidance.", "Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Sure. And then, just on the free cash flow guidance of $1.95 billion to $2.05 billion, how much of the tax reform savings is flowing through into that number on sort of a bottom-line basis? Any color there?", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "Sure. So, as I mentioned, we expect about $275 million of a reduction on a pre-tax reform basis versus tax reform basis. That $275 million is inclusive of both the reduction in the rate, the corporate rate, and then also moving from bonus depreciation to full expensing of capital. And so, that $275 million is offset then by $50 million to $75 million of an increase that we can expect as our pre-tax earnings growth.", "And then, when we look at 2017, we did have some tax planning benefits that won't repeat. We talked about pulling forward some of our capital spend into the fourth quarter. We also accomplished a number of other tax planning initiatives in the fourth quarter that provided us some benefit. So, all in all, I think you focused on that $275 million and the $50 million to $75 million of increase and that says, what kind of flow-through that we would expect in free cash flow in the year ahead.", "Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Got you. And just on capital allocation, Jim, how are you thinking about M&A? I know there's antitrust issues in the solid waste business, maybe there's some tuck-ins, seller expectations are higher, as we heard from one of your peers earlier. What's your priority in terms of M&A as you look at the business on a go-forward basis, whether it's industrial waste or other avenues, energy? I know you want to be investment grade, so that maybe you don't limit sort of the sizing of M&A, but just any color on capital allocation, specifically M&A?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yes. Specific to M&A, Hamzah, I think we've said many times on calls that right down the middle of the fairway seems to be working pretty well for us. So, solid waste, if I had to kind of order these, I would say solid waste would be first, but there are some tangential businesses that may not be straight down the middle but are very good businesses that we like.", "Certainly, energy services is a business that shown some real nice growth, particularly in the latter half of 2017, and we expect that going forward into 2018. So, that's a business that we like. The haz waste business we like as well and anything related to the industrial services business, because it does appear that the economy is growing and will grow in 2018 and 2019 in those areas. And then recycling, even though recycling is down, it's a business that we still are committed to. So, those are probably the key areas.", "Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Great. Congratulations, Jim, on your retirement and the 10 grandkids. Thanks.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Thanks. I'm still here, Hamzah, and no more grandkids, I hope.", "Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Good.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thank you very much for taking the questions. Devina, can we start \u2013 or Devina and Jims, can we start with the CapEx, the incremental $100 million, just to understand that. That's replacing vehicles faster, it's not necessarily adding trucks faster, it's the way to think about that. Plus growth would be \u2013 you had a really good volume here. So, you got some incremental sell development you need to deal with, that's the way to think about that?", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "So, I think with regards to the fleet part of the answer, Michael, I would actually revise that to say it is both. So, it's replacing some of our existing fleet faster and it's investing in trucks \u2013 incremental trucks as we see core commercial and industrial collection growth. And then you're right, we've seen accelerated landfill volume increases. And so, we'll build out more on the sell development side as well.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. So, following through on the route additions, this is being driven by true underlying volume growth. I mean, in my 30 years of covering this, there was a time where a garbage company would add a truck at 45 hours' worth of utilization and hope it grew into 50 hours' worth of utilization. And now, my sense is that collection is fundamentally full and you're starting to find yourself at 55 hours on average, so, let's add the 11th truck when the 10th truck route to get back to 50 hours; that's the way to think about it?", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. Michael, the way I look at it, we grew commercial and industrial volume, as I stated in the script, I mean, at very healthy numbers, yet our routes grew about 1%. So, we're at a local district level, we probably \u2013 we look at it your way, but across the company, we're looking at it on a gross metric standpoint and then seeing where the biggest growth opportunity is as we look forward. We look very closely at each fall when we do strategic planning with our areas at what MSAs are growing. What's our GDP? And what do we expect from them? And that also affects the truck side of the house.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Jim and Michael, I would say that speaks to the success, which we've talked about for a couple of years, the success of our service delivery optimization program. I mean, when you're only growing your routes by 1%, and you're growing your volume by 2.3%, that tells you that you're doing something right on the efficiency side through John and Jeff Harris.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. We, for example, Michael, owned the SDO, our efficiency and process that we rolled out several years ago. We've got 98% of our districts that are up about 98% of our routes are certified. So, we're really pushing to continue to get that efficiency. And your overall concept is right, but we may look at it metric-wise a little differently.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Fair enough. And if I follow-through then on the CapEx, is this an 2018 \u2013 I'm running at a higher rate of normalized pace and therefore, I can think of your free cash flow as actually having \u2013 there's another (46:41) $100 million of play there to the upside, that's the way to think of \u2013 because the other way to put it -look at this is and I would pursue it further with Devina, is if you finished the year at $1.77 billion, but you're going to a midpoint of $2 billion, and I got something in the $200 million as tax related, then it doesn't look like there's a lot of operating growth there when in reality there is.", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "We've got a great deal of operating growth in the free cash flow line. So, I would say, first, with regard to capital and how we think about it over the long term, we've talked for a long time about 9% to 10% being our target capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue. And certainly, our pricing focus in growing our revenue through price is one of the tools that helps for us to maintain that discipline in capital expenditures. But when you look over the long term, in years where volume growth is lower, we didn't just trend toward the bottom of that range, we often broke through and were in the 8% range.", "So, when we're looking at capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue over the long term in the future, if we continue to see the level of volume growth that we saw in 2017 and expect in 2018, you can expect our capital expenditures to be above the high-end of that typical range, because we're going to be really focused on making sure that we deploy assets in a way to participate in growth.", "And so, we finished 2017 at about 10.5% of revenue. And if you look at 2018 in the plan, it'll take us to about 10.7% to 11% of revenue in capital in the year ahead. And so, it's too early for us to start to give guidance on 2019 and 2020. But I can tell you that if we see the economy responds the way we expect it to with tax reform and potentially infrastructure spending ahead, then you can see us continue to spend a higher level of capital.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Michael, I would add one thing to what Devina said, and that is that, in my mind, the best indicator of how the business is doing is the single biggest component of free cash flow, which is EBITDA. And if you look at our EBITDA guidance that we gave and you factor in that we've got $65 million in there that was for the $2,000 bonus, you've got somewhere between $55 million and $65 million in headwind on recycling and still providing growth of kind of $200 million to $225 million, which is kind of 4.8% to 6%, something like that, in a 2.5% to 3.5% economy, whatever it is; that's pretty darn strong. I think it tells you that the core business is really performing well. We're pleased with the business, we're pleased with the economy that we're handed here.", "And so, that free cash flow number, Devina went through it well, but I think the number \u2013 the underlying number that is most impressive is that EBITDA number.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Fair enough. And to that and Devina, in 3Q, you reset the baseline and free cash flow to $1.6 billion. What's that number look like now post tax reform?", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "So, I think at this point, with the higher CapEx we're seeing and somewhat of a position that the American economy is not really used to, the corporate America is not used to, which is lower corporate taxes and what to do with those. I mean that really, honestly, Michael, has been the central question around corporate tax reform is will companies return it directly to shareholders? Or will they inject it in the economy and see it come out the other side in the form of higher economic growth?", "I think before we give a number that is a higher baseline \u2013 by the way, it is going to be higher. I mean just to be clear here, our free cash flow baseline is going up, but we need the next few months to figure out by how much. And some of that is because the way we handle taxes or this tax or these tax reform dollars is a little different than just simply tacking them on to free cash flow.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Fair enough. In your guidance, the 2% for price, if I look at your summary datasheet the way you disaggregated for collection, disposal, recycling, season, fuel, that 2% would imply about a $290 million growth in dollars. How do I break that up in \u2013 at least what's the recycling headwind of that in \u2013 when I think about that to get to the $290 million on the revenue line?", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "When we look at revenue, you're speaking about our 2018 guidance?", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yes. Yeah.", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yes.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yes.", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "So when we look at the expected headwinds from recycling to revenue, we think it's about $100 million in the year ahead.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Okay. That's very helpful. And then, retention, where do you stand at this juncture in your retention within the 20,000 employees that are drivers and mechanics? And what is the opportunity there and at what pace do you think you can improve it?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. I mean, we're probably close to 20% when we think about turnover. And so, what's interesting about that, Michael, is that in our first two years, our turn \u2013 half of our turnover takes place with employees. I'm really talking about those two job groups that you mentioned. But half of that turnover takes place in the first two years.", "So, if we can get them to that whatever the magic is to that date, if we can get them to year \u2013 the end of year two, then we hang onto them. They choose to really make a career with Waste Management. That was part of our objective with the $2,000 was, first of all, we buy ourselves a year and so somebody that is at currently at 14 months with the company, now we get them pass that to your point to the extent that there is some magic to that.", "And then, we'll also have the next 11 months, 10 months to really analyze and see is there merit to some type of longer-term retention program?", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "And, Michael, we've spent a lot of time looking at this issue of driver and technician retention. And the other thing that I'd just add just a little bit of color to Jim's point, that was right on target, was that if you'd look at efficiency or our risk cost or our customer scores from drivers, those longer-tenured drivers just kill it compared to that first year or two new driver. So, not only do you get the value, the obvious value from retention, you get it on the true core business side as well that, we think, will add real value long-term as we get that number down as low as we can.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "And by the way, we haven't baked any improvements in that number that I gave you, Michael, into any plan. And we've got some numbers that show that the cash cost of a turnover employee can be in the range of $12,000 to a higher number. I mean, I've seen some numbers that are higher than that, it's quite a bit higher than that and none of that's baked in. So, to the extent that we actually improve our turnover in 2018 with the $2,000, that ends up being just gravy for us.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Very good. And then, on the volume side, is Fairfax out now in 2018, it's out of the number?", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yes.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. Yeah. It's back up.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. It's back up. And then, on deals, I just want to make sure I get the $100 million to $200 million, but you're referring to what you're spending, not dollars or revenues, or is it dollar or revenues? I just want to make sure I was...", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "That's what we're spending, right.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "You're spending, okay. And so, you're staying with the $100 million to $200 million for now, and we'll see what the pace of activity, and people (55:10)", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. And, look, I mean, that number is kind of a squishy number because last year, it was $200 million and the year before, it was $100 million, but then there's been years where we've \u2013 all of a sudden a deal has come across the table that looked really good to us and we spent deaf and bar (55:25) and we spent $500 million or $450 million or whatever so. So, that number is kind of a guidance number but that number can change, and particularly, this year as we think about corporate and individual tax reform.", "We've given a number of a $100 million to $200 million but that could very easily change.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay.", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "We didn't build anything about that $100 million to $200 million in our guidance.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Fair enough. And then lastly on the recycling, the 4 to \u2013 goes sense in 3Q, it goes to 8.2% some of that has to be taxes, but the rest of it is there's more expense, there was less lower price. And I was curious to mix and then the other is just you're pretty big exporter to China, I'm assuming you have found alternatives. And so you've found places for the volume to go now and we have to wait and see how the market pricing behaves once the Chinese New Year is over.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. I'll share this with Trevathan on the first part. Really it is low \u2013 this is the low, this is a slow time of the year for China. So, they're not buying a lot of cardboard at this point. So, this is the right time of year for them to do it, not coincidence that they did this with a Green Fence a few years ago during the same time a year. And how that's kind of plays out for us is that we're seeing because of the lower demand you're seeing prices drop off.", "So, we've seen, I think Jim, a 24% decrease in price in the fourth quarter and we're projecting something in that neighborhood maybe even a little more in Q1. And then starting to normalize in terms of commodity prices in Q2, but particularly in Q3 and Q4. And then the other side is, is cost, and because of these contamination limits of 0.5%, we are seeing our processing cost to go up. And so we're \u2013 that's something that we have some control over and we're in the process of addressing that going forward.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Hey, Michael, to your first part, yeah, we have outlets for our materials. We talked about it quite a bit on the last couple of calls. We've spend a lot of time, our team at corporate, we think, are the best in the industry at finding outlets for materials. And we've done that aggressively. It doesn't affect cost, cost is still down, but we absolutely have outlets for our materials. But Jim mentioned contamination, I also want to mention, we're looking to reclaim part of that contamination cost over time. We did a lot of work as we've talked about the last three or four years, around the business model itself. And contracts are part of that and we've gotten real value, this is still a really valuable business to our shareholder, but to our customers.", "And we've gotten value out of those contract changes that got rid of floor pricing. Most of them added contamination charges, we \u2013 for third-party volumes, we're charging contamination charges and it started to get more aggressive in that regard. For the public sector contracts, most of them have the clauses in place, but getting it from those residential customers is a little different task. And we're aggressively ramping-up that effort as well, to try to reclaim that cost. And again, improve the business model itself, so that long-term, these kinds of changes are managed properly.", "But without a doubt, we're getting rid of our materials, have no issues there, but it is affecting price and cost because of the transportation.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "I don't think it's overstating it, Michael, to say we're going to go to battle against contamination here. And I think that's better for us economically. It's also better for the environment. So, it's the right thing to do on all fronts, but we are definitely going to go to battle against contamination.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "This is fascinating \u2013 I realized this is in the form to continue that part of the conversation, but it's the fascinating part of the conversation, because it means getting back to the municipality and everybody having an honest conversation about how this has been approached from the start, at the point of collection...", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "You're exactly right.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yeah.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "And it's about creating a sustainable business model, as well as sustainable benefit to the environment.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yeah.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "All right. We better let Corey talk or he's going to hang up.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Corey is next.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "So, one last thing, Jim Trevathan, I've known you for most of that 39 years and I can say that you are leaving just better than you found it, both your business and the community you're serving. It's been a pleasure and thank you.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Thank you, Michael.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Corey Greendale with First Analysis.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Good morning. I love that previewing that I'm next. I can prepare; thank you.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "I see it on the board, here.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Yeah. And Jim Trevathan, congratulations on sprinting into the sunset and hope it's a good final year. So, just a couple of questions. So, first of all, actually maybe hitting on a couple of things you've been talking about. On the cost side, so as you mentioned, Jim Fish, the EBITDA improvement includes that $65 million in bonuses. Can you just talk a little bit?", "I'm looking for more about how you're thinking about this, not like a definitive answer, but it's kind of philosophy, why did you decide a one-time bonus was kind of the right thing to do? And how you're thinking about like for modeling out 2019, should we say that well that $65 million goes away, or you're thinking about ways you're going to reinvest, maybe now with another bonus, but other things you're going to do along similar lines for retention purposes?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah, Corey. I mean, look, there were a couple of objectives and we've talked about them on the call and in other forms. But beyond just injecting dollars into the economy and giving something, as Devina mentioned, to those employees that don't participate in the salary and incentive plans, we've talked a lot today about the fact that we \u2013 that part of the objective was to encourage our folks to make careers at Waste Management.", "Keep in mind, this is somewhat of kind of uncharted water for us, because we haven't \u2013 I would argue that nobody on the call or at this table has been through something where we've seen a big tax reduction like this and how that is best returned to shareholders. I mean, is it best returned to shareholders just through a straight share repurchase, or is it best returned to shareholders through injecting it back to the economy and then seeing that growth?", "And so, as we've thought about what to do with some of those dollars as it relates to our employees, we felt we don't really know the answer. And so, a piece of that objective was to buy ourselves a little bit of time, hence the payout at the end of the year and help us by doing that in designing programs for the future, potentially that help us with retention. So, I don't know whether that answers your question, but that was really our thinking.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Yeah, that's fine.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "I think one more \u2013 just one more piece of color there. I'd like to stress that that $2,000 per employee was not in place to combat wage inflation in any sense. We we've got a process in place. We work really closely with our HR teams. We look at the demand, the competitive wages by MSA, and we adjust accordingly. We've found a few that we think needed changes and then we changed them, and we'll continue to look at that. This has nothing to do with just normal wage inflation. It's to look strategically at our employees and how do we improve that retention issue.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "That's absolutely right. It wasn't promised, by the way, either, Corey.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "No, I appreciate that answer. And then on the volume front, maybe this is another slightly hard question to answer but, Jim Fish, in the past you've talked about focusing somewhat, I think, disproportionately on opportunities for growth in parts of either the economy or the country that are growing as opposed to looking for volume kind of everywhere. Is that still the case?", "And part of what I'm looking for is kind of an adjustable market opportunity number like how much of the country do you put in that bucket now, and how much of the country would you say is not in that kind of growth, so we're not seeing \u2013 you're not going to go after volumes as much?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "I think, the good news here, Corey, is \u2013 and you're right that's how we used to talk about it was that, hey, it looks pretty good in Texas but the rest of the country doesn't look very good. It looks good in Florida but not so good in the Northeast. I would tell you right now as we go through our monthly financial reviews and talk to our area vice presidents, boy, it's hard to find an area that doesn't have some strength. Now, there are some areas that are stronger than others. California for example is absolutely fantastic for us right now as is Florida. Texas has been, excluding the hurricane cleanup, has been a little slower because of the energy business but that's starting to come back.", "But even places that historically have been slow for three decades that's kind of rust belt area, have started to show some real promise in terms of growth: Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania. New England's been good for us as well.", "So, I've named just about every area for us. Canada is doing well for us as well. Western Canada is a little bit more like Texas because it's more energy-driven. But I would expect that Western Canada will start to pick up just like Texas is. So, hard to come up with one that's not doing pretty well right now.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Great. And just one last quick one. As we're modeling out the quarters of the year, is there anything you'd point out to us as far as like particularly difficult comps or event-driven work or I don't know if the hurricanes make a big difference, but where you see kind of meaningful changes in volume relative to the full year numbers as you look quarter-to-quarter?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "I think, really, we've talked about this a lot as we prepared for this call. And the only business that gives us pause right now is recycling. We, obviously, increased from $0.04 to kind of an $0.08 to $0.10 so, basically a $0.09 number in terms of headwind for 2018. If something unexpected were to happen, if something crazy were to happen in China, if they just simply decided not to buy OCC, which I don't know how they could do that, as a huge exporter.", "But if they decided they're going to stay at the same level of purchase for the remainder of the year that they are today, yeah, that would throw a wrench into our operation a bit. But keep in mind that that's still, on a revenue basis, recycling is still 10% or less of our overall revenue base. So, the only thing that causes me to say, okay, this one could impact us would be recycling. The rest of our guidance, including our traditional solid waste, looks very, very strong right now.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "And Corey, the only other one is on the landfill side, all that storm debris happened in the second half of the year. So, just landfill comps will get more difficult in that regard. But the core MSW shouldn't be affected; it should be still strong, regardless of the quarter.", "Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.", "Got it. Thanks for the answers.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer.", "Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Thanks. And just to pick-up right there, amplifying Corey's question. It looks like the volume comps were actually stronger in the first half of the year, all-in, for 2017. So I mean, just picking a little bit more precisely about the cadence of volume for 2018, that 2%, I mean, should it be a little bit lower in the first half of the year and gathering strength maybe in the third quarter? Is that the right way to think about it?", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "Well actually, Noah, in 2017, those volume comps, the way they trended, had a lot to do with the anniversary of the National Account business. And so, that's what you saw impact 2017, particularly in the commercial line of business. So, we don't have that same, kind of, large contracts that we'll be anniversarying in the year ahead. So, other than what Jim mentioned with regard to the landfill volumes and the storm debris, there's not anything that would dramatically influence the quarter-by-quarter volume trends in 2018.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "I will say, Noah, what is encouraging to us, as we look into 2018, is that we're through the month of January, obviously, and when we look at January's volume, with slow volume on recycling, we still had a very good month. So, we're encouraged with what we saw in the month of January; it's a small sample, it's 1 out of 12, but January looked encouraging.", "Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Great. Thanks for that. And then I think, just thinking about price/volume mix, for many years, I think at least going back five years' average yields on collection and disposal was always higher than volume. I mean certainly, we're shedding some unwanted or low-margin business strategically. Now in 2017, we've seen volume actually outstrip yield and looks like they're kind of on par for 2018. So, can you just comment as to how the strategy is playing out? I mean, is this basically the result of many years of kind of leading with price, because now the way it looks, it looks like it's not necessarily price-like growth?", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "I think, no. We're \u2013 we have not changed our strategy regarding price at all. We will go get our core price guidance numbers and we'll execute that. Those processes are in place and we're pretty good at it at the area level with corporate leading the way. The volume change, the economy has helped some, obviously. We think we've gotten better. We know we have on the defection side. We've gotten some again, the storm debris kind of things that helped that volume to price relationship, improve the volume side of the house. The outage that we've talked about in Virginia did; special waste was strong last year especially in the second half of the year and should move forward.", "But most of that has come from economic change from our focus on defection and from our attempt to go put the right resources in the right cities and MSAs to take advantage of the volume that's occurring per GDP. That's what Jim talked about. So, as the opportunity is there, we've gotten better at getting that volume.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "One question, Noah, that hasn't been asked which has direct bearing on your question is CPI. I mean, we typically don't talk about CPI because for the last few years, it's worked against us and we've just said we'll get our price numbers irrespective of what CPI does. But CPI does impact about \u2013 and we have kind of indexed base pricing on about 35% of our total business. And we've always said that about a 10 basis point increase in CPI equates to a $0.01 per share. We've built in some increase, call it, 20 basis points into our pricing for 2018.", "But we all saw the CPI numbers that came out yesterday, that we're higher than most people expected. So, there could be some upside there, albeit kind of on a half-year basis because we've already taken, we tend to take our index-type price increases in January and July with a few of them lingering into October.", "But on a full year basis, once we get a full year of the CPI, I would expect that there will be some tailwind for us from CPI, but we won't get the full tailwind in 2018.", "Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Thanks so much for answering the question and anticipating it, Jim. I'll jump back in the queue.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "All right. Thanks, Noah.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO.", "Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Hi, good morning. It's Henry Chien, and I'm calling for Jeff. Thanks for going into the pricing. I was going to ask of how much of that is embedded in the core price? But I was just curious to hear your thoughts on how sustainable achieving that kind of 4% core price growth? And are you seeing any competition in getting the new contracts?", "And then, just trying to understand how much of this kind of seems like above market pricing growth that you're able to achieve over the next few years? Thanks.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah, Henry. I don't see any different competitive landscape than we've had for the last couple of years. It is a very competitive business, and I think it always will be. It has been and will be. Volume obviously helps in that from \u2013 it comes from the economy. There are more start-ups that give all of us a better opportunity to get some volume growth, but our core price strategy isn't going to change for our core collection customers.", "We're still \u2013 the marketplace allows it, we go get that core price increase and we will in 2018. And I think the teams are set up and ready to do again in 2019 and 2020 and on. I just don't see that changing, and I don't see a competitive difference today than two or five years ago.", "Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Got it. Okay. Great. That's good to hear. And in terms of \u2013 I just wanted to switch back to M&A and your acquisition strategy. With growth kind of accelerating all throughout the U.S., do you imagine any shift or are you thinking of any shift in the types of acquisitions you're looking at, whether it's expanding your routes or putting more of a focus on that in the collection business, or I know you mentioned industrial is the kind of potential opportunity, but just curious in your thoughts there? Thank you.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "The only thing, Henry, that could come to mind that might be a little different, and we certainly haven't identified anything down this path but would be something technology-related. I think other than that, you won't see us stray too far outside of kind of our norm in terms of M&A.", "Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Got it. Okay. Thanks so much.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Michael Feniger with Bank of America.", "Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "You bet.", "Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "I'm just curious, though, like what is your view on the optimal leverage ratio for this company? Clearly, free cash flow is going up. You have a higher baseline of free cash flow. I guess I'm just trying to think what should we be thinking about the leverage at this part of the waste cycle? I mean, surely we're below that right now.", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "So, are you speaking to debt to EBITDA?", "Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yeah.", "Devina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.", "Is that what you're asking with regard to leverage? Yeah. We're certainly below our long-term averages. We're at the best level, I think, that the company has ever been, certainly in my tenure. And we've talked for a long time about the fact that our goal is a solid investment-grade rating. And so, we'll continue to prioritize that when we think about leverage.", "We don't chase leverage up as our business grows and as EBITDA grows by allocating more cash to things that aren't accretive to the business for the long term. That's our first priority, is ensuring that we continue to invest dollars to grow that return on invested capital and grow our business over the long term. So, we don't want to make short-term decisions that would affect the leverage.", "We, certainly, are comfortable with where we are today and we're comfortable up to around 3.25 times because we think that is what \u2013 is needed to maintain our investment-grade rating.", "Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. That's helpful. And just lastly, you guys are clearly investing in the business, investing your fleet, and using tax reform as a benefit. You mentioned how routes, for you guys, are up 1%, is there any concern that you're seeing smaller players maybe adding routes or adding trucks ahead of the underlying volume growth? I know you guys are being disciplined. I'm just trying to get a sense of what you're seeing in the tightness of the market and out of the smaller players.", "James E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.", "Yeah. Michael, I haven't seen any change in the 2016 or 2017 versus the historical view that all of our competitors whether they're small third parties or the majors. I think, in general, this is a disciplined business that rewards those who act in a disciplined manner and, I think, the industry is for the most part. I mean, there are always one-offs, but not that would affect any of us over the long haul.", "Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And if I could just lastly, I mean, you mentioned recycling is part of core. You're exploring that that's part of the pillars of what you're looking at with M&A. Just to push you a little bit on that. Is that more looking at trying to have more scale or is it more looking at a certain technology? And what would you actually be kind of focusing on with M&A when it comes to recycling?", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "You're right. I answered it maybe at an earlier question about technology, and that might be a place where we would look at, at technology. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're already looking at and testing, piloting some technology in the recycling line of business. We're always looking for where there's kind of innovation within our business. But recycling might be an area where we would find some. It would be nice to smooth out the volatility of that business.", "Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, guys.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions.", "James C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.", "Okay. In closing, first and foremost, our sincere thoughts and prayers go out to the Community Park on Florida. Look, no one should have to go through what they faced yesterday. With such a horrific act and, I would tell you, this has become all too common in today's society. So, Parkland, you're in our prayers for sure.", "Secondly, and on a far more positive notes. I'd like to say a few words about two really great friends and great executives Jeff Harris and Jim Trevathan. Their retirement date is still 11 months away but at that date, Jim and Jeff will have dedicated 59 years between the two of them to Waste Management. And really a lot of where we are today, the heights that we've achieved of late are due to those two guys, to Jeff Harris and Jim Trevathan. So, we'll, obviously, talk more about them as we get closer to their retirement dates.", "But over the next 10 months, I plan to try and absorb a lot of the knowledge and wisdom and expertise that they have and that they've developed over those 59 years.
