Today's call is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome to ExxonMobil's fourth quarter and full year 216 earnings call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website.", "So before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statements shown on slide two.", "Turning now to slide three, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our performance. ExxonMobil generated full year earnings of $7.8 billion and fourth quarter earnings of $1.7 billion. Corporation continues to generate cash flow through the business cycle to meet our commitment to shareholders and support investments across the value chain.", "In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations and asset sales exceeded dividends and net investments by a healthy margin. We are realizing the benefit of strengthening prices in the fourth quarter in our upstream financial results. However these results included a $2 billion impairment charge in the U.S. segment, largely related to dry gas operations with undeveloped acreage in the Rocky Mountain region. The impairment charge was the result of an asset recoverability study completed during the quarter and is consistent with the approach we took in 2015.", "Continued solid performance on our downstream and chemicals segments underscores the resilience of our integrated business throughout the commodity price cycle. Corporation continued to progress strategic investments across the upstream, downstream and chemical segments during the year, including execution of major projects, value accretive acquisitions and pursuit of high potential exploration opportunities.", "Moving to slide four, we provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Global economic growth remained modest during the fourth quarter. In the United States, the pace of economic expansion slowed relative to a stronger third quarter. We have stabilized in China and remain tepid in Europe and Japan despite some improvement in the quarter.", "Crude oil and natural gas prices strengthened during the quarter on anticipation of an improved supply balance as well as colder weather. Refining margins improved in Europe and Asia while seasonal margins in the United States weakened. And finally, chemical margins decreased due to higher feed and energy costs, driven largely by commodity products.", "Turning now to the financial results shown on slide five. As indicated, fourth quarter earnings were $1.7 billion or $0.41 per share. In the quarter, the corporation distributed dividends of $3.1 billion to our shareholders. CapEx was $4.8 billion, down 35% from the fourth quarter of 2015 reflecting ongoing capital discipline and strong project execution. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $9.5 billion and at the end of the quarter cash totaled $3.7 billion and debt was $42.8 billion.", "The next slide provides more detail on sources and uses of cash. So over the quarter, cash decreased from $5.1 billion to $3.7 billion. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program yielded $9.5 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. The negative adjustment for working capital and other items reflects changes in deferred tax balances.", "Uses of cash included shareholder distributions of $3.1 billion and net investments in the business of $3.8 billion. Debt and other financing items decreased cash by $4 billion, primarily due to a reduction in short-term debt. Cash flow from operations and asset sales cover dividends and net investments in the quarter by more than $2 billion.", "Moving now to slide seven for a review of our segmented results. ExxonMobil's fourth quarter earnings decreased $1.1 billion from a year ago quarter as a result of the impairment charge taken in the U.S. upstream segment. This was partly offset by stronger upstream results and in earnings benefit in the corporate and financing segment as a result of favorable non-U.S. one-time tax items. On average, we expect that near-term corporate and financing expenses will be in the range of $400 million to $600 million per quarter which does represent a reduction relative to our previous guidance.", "Similarly in the sequential comparison shown on slide eight, earnings decreased $970 million.", "Turning now to the upstream financial and operating results starting on slide nine. Fourth quarter upstream earnings decreased $1.5 billion from a year ago quarter resulting in a loss of $642 million. Higher realizations improved earnings by $510 million driven by higher liquids prices. Crude realizations increased more than $8 per barrel whereas natural gas realizations decreased $0.32 per thousand cubic feet. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $50 million. And other items added $70 million driven by lower operating expenses partly offset by the absence of favorable tax items. Excluding the impairment charge, fourth quarter 2016 upstream earnings totaled $1.4 billion, up $528 million from the prior year quarter.", "Moving to slide 10. Oil equivalent production decreased 3% compared to the fourth quarter of last year to 4.1 million barrels per day. Liquids production decreased 97,000 barrels per day as new project growth and more program volumes were more than offset by field decline, entitlement impacts and downtime in Nigeria. Natural gas production decreased to 179 million cubic feet per day as higher demand and project growth were more than offset by decline, regulatory impacts in the Netherlands, entitlement effects and divestments.", "Turning now to the sequential comparison, starting on slide 11. Upstream earnings decreased $1.3 billion from the third quarter of 2016. Improved realizations increased earnings by $450 million. Crude prices were $4 per barrel higher and natural gas prices were up $0.41 per thousand cubic feet. Favorable volume and mix effects contributed $230 million, driven by higher seasonal demand, lower downtime and project growth. Other items increased earnings by $90 million driven by favorable foreign exchange effects.", "Moving to slide 12. Sequentially, volumes increased more than 8% or 310,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Liquids production was up 173,000 barrels per day, mainly the result of lower downtime and growth from new projects and work programs. Natural gas production was 823 million cubic feet per day higher than the previous quarter. Stronger seasonal demand in Europe and entitlement effects were partly offset by regulatory impacts in the Netherlands and field decline.", "Moving now to the downstream financial and operating results starting on slide 13. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $1.2 billion, a decrease of $110 million compared to the fourth of 2015. Weaker margins reduced earnings by $570 million. Favorable volume mix effects mainly from increased operational efficiency and production optimization improved earnings by $200 million. All other items added $260 million, mostly from asset management activities, partly offset by increased maintenance costs and unfavorable foreign exchange effects. In the quarter, Imperial Oil completed the sale of its retail network. The sites are then converted to their branded wholesale distributor model resulting in an earnings benefit of $522 million dollars.", "Turning to slide 14. Downstream earnings were flat sequentially. Stronger refining margins outside the United States and improved volume mix increased earnings by $160 million and $100 million respectively. All other items reduced earnings by $250 million driven by increased maintenance costs and unfavorable inventory and foreign exchange effects partially offset by asset management gains.", "Moving now to the chemical financial and operating results, starting on slide 15. Fourth quarter chemical earnings were $872 million, down $91 million compared to the prior year quarter. Weaker margins primarily for specialty products decreased earnings by $10 million while unfavorable volumes and mix effects further reduced earnings by $30 million. All other items decreased earnings by $50 million largely due to unfavorable inventory and foreign exchange effects.", "Moving to slide 16. Chemical earnings were down almost $300 million sequentially. Weaker margins driven by higher feed and energy costs reduced earnings by $200 million. Higher volumes added $50 million and all other items decreased earnings $150 million including seasonally higher operating expenses and unfavorable inventory and foreign exchange effects.", "Turning now to the full year financial results, starting on slide 17. As I mentioned, 2016 earnings totaled $7.8 billion and represents a $1.88 per share. Corporation distributed $12.5 billion in dividends to our shareholders. CapEx totaled $19.3 billion for the year, a reduction of $11.7 billion versus 2015.", "Throughout the year, we maintained a relentless focus on costs, capturing both structural efficiencies and market savings while maintaining operational integrity. These efforts resulted in further reduction in total CapEx and OpEx of $16 billion in the year versus 2015 when excluding the effect of the upstream impairment charge. As a result, cash flow from operations and asset sales was $26.4 billion.", "Turning to slide 18. Cash balances were flat to year end 2015 at $3.7billion. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program, resulted in $26.4 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. The negative working capital and other impacts for the year were driven by lower upstream payables, deferred tax impacts and cash contributions to the U.S. pension plan. Uses included shareholder distributions of $12.5 billion and net investments of $16.7 billion. Debt and other financing items provided $2.8 billion in the year.", "Moving to slide 19. This graphic illustrates the corporation's sources and uses of cash during the year and highlights our ability to meet our financial objectives. In a difficult business environment, the corporation continued to generate strong cash flow from operations and asset sales to support the dividend and most of our net investments in the business, supplemented by a moderate increase in debt financing. We maintain financial flexibility to continue to invest through the cycle in attractive opportunities.", "As indicated, shareholder distributions totaled $12.5 billion. Annual per share dividends were up 3.5% compared to 2015 and this marks the 3fourth consecutive year of per share dividend growth. In the fourth quarter of 2017, ExxonMobil will limit share purchases to amounts needed to offset dilution related to our benefit plans and programs. During the year, ExxonMobil generated $9.7 billion of free cash flow, up $3.2 billion from 2015 reflecting the resilience of our integrated businesses and our focus on the fundamentals.", "Looking ahead, we anticipate our 2017 capital and exploration expenditures to be about $22 billion. I know there will be a lot of interest in our investment plans and we will share additional details in a few weeks at our Analyst Meeting.", "Moving on to slide 20 and a review of our full year segment results. 2016 earnings fell $8.3 billion as the impact of lower realizations in margins on our upstream and downstream segments was partially offset by stronger chemical results and lower corporate costs associated with several one-time tax items. As a result, the full year effective tax rate was 30%. Now assuming current commodity prices and the existing portfolio mix, we do anticipate that the effective tax rate will be between 25% and 35% excluding the impact of any large one-time items. On this basis, our full year 2016 effective tax rate was within the new guidance range.", "Turning now to the full year comparison of upstream results, starting on slide 21. Upstream earnings of $196 million were $6.9 billion lower than 2015. Realizations reduced earnings by $5.3 billion as crude oil prices decreased over $7 per barrel and natural gas prices declined by $1.40 per thousand cubic feet. Favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings by $130 million driven by new project growth. All other items added $310 million dollars due to lower operating expenses partly offset by the absence of favorable tax items. Excluding the impairment charge, 2016 upstream earnings totaled $2.2 billion.", "Moving to slide 22. As indicated, volumes ended the year at 4.1 million oil equivalent barrels per day, down about 1% compared to last year but within our full year guidance of four to 4.2 million oil equivalent barrels per day. Liquids production increased 20,000 barrels per day as project and work program growth was partly offset by field decline and higher unplanned downtime, most notably from third-party impacts in Nigeria and wildfires in Canada. Natural gas production, however, decreased 388 million cubic feet per day. Growth in projects and work programs was more than offset field decline, regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and divestments.", "The full year comparison for downstream results as shown on slide 23. Earnings were $4.2 billion, a decrease of $2.4billion from 2015. Weaker margins decreased earnings by $3.8 billion. Favorable volume, mix effects increased earnings by $560 million and all other items primarily asset management gains increased earnings by $920 million.", "On slide 24, we show the full year comparison for chemical results. 2016 earnings were $4.6 billion, up $197 million from 2015. Stronger commodity margins driven by advantage liquids cracking increased earnings $440 million while higher volumes added $100 million. Other items reduced earnings by $340 million reflecting the absence of asset management gains.", "Moving next to an update on our upstream project activities. So we continue to deliver on our investment plans with an unwavering focus on long-term value. Five major projects started up in 2016, adding 250 thousand oil equivalent barrels per day of working interest production capacity. In the fourth quarter, Kashagan and Gorgon Train 2 started up and like other 2016 projects continue to ramp up to plateau production levels. Looking forward, construction activities continue to progress on another five major projects that will come online over the next two years. These projects we will together contribute another 340,000 oil equivalent barrels per day of working interest production capacity.", "Moving now to slide 26. Our focused exploration program continues to enhance our resource portfolio as demonstrated in the fourth quarter. In Guyana, ExxonMobil submitted the development plan for the initial phase of the Liza field. We continue to progress broader development planning activities based on a phased development approach. As part of these activities, contracts were awarded to perform front-end engineering and design. We expect to reach the final investment decision for the project later this year. Additionally, as I mentioned in the third quarter earnings call, the Liza-3 appraisal well successfully encountered an additional deeper reservoir which was being evaluated at the time. This reservoir is now estimated to contain 100 to 150 million oil equivalent barrels beneath the Liza field.", "Also, offshore Guyana, the Payara exploration well discovered hydrocarbons marking the second discovery on the Stabroek Block. The well encountered more than 95 feet of high quality oil bearing sandstone reservoirs. Two sidetracks have been drilled to rapidly evaluate the discovery and a well test is about to get underway. The data will be analyzed in the coming months to better understand the full resource potential and development options.", "Now, after the Payara well test, the Stena Carron drillship will next move to the Snoek prospect just south of the Liza discovery. ExxonMobil also made two additional discoveries in the fourth quarter including the Nigeria Owowo-3 oil discovery announced in the third quarter earnings call and the Muruk discovery in Papa New Guinea. Both Owowo and Muruk are near currently producing fields which will enable capital efficient development. We also continued to capture new prospective exploration acreage. In Mexico's offshore bid round one, ExxonMobil and Total jointly submitted the apparent high bid for Block 2 located in the Perdido area near the U.S. border. In Cyprus, ExxonMobil and our partner Qatar Petroleum have been selected as the winners of offshore Block 10 in a recent tender round and we look forward to negotiating the production sharing contract for this high potential block. ExxonMobil has also been awarded an offshore prospecting license for exploration activities in the Gulf of Papua in Papua New Guinea. The initial scope of work on this block is expected to include seismic acquisition.", "Turning now to slide 27 and an update on ExxonMobil's U.S. unconventional portfolio. As a leading oil and gas producer in the United States, we have a strong acreage position and proven operational expertise in unconventional plays. XTO's daily production is currently more than 700,000 oil equivalent barrels per day of which 38% is liquids. Our ownership and operating position enable flexible development and allow us to maximize learning curve benefits through the cycle. For instance, in the Permian Basin, where we operate two-thirds of our production, our average drilling footage per day has increased about 85% since 2014 because of continuous learning and application of ExxonMobil's proprietary Fast Drill process. We continue to focus on liquids growth through development activities and strategic farm-ins and acquisitions. Since 2010, XTO has grown liquids production at a compounded annual growth rate of about 11% and which currently represents about 12% of the corporation's global liquids production.", "Moving now to slide 28. Our most recent acquisition in the Permian further strengthens our unconventional portfolio adding high quality acreage in the Delaware Basin and more than doubling our resources in the Permian to greater than six billion oil equivalent barrels. ExxonMobil agreed to acquire privately owned companies whose holdings include 250,000 net acres of leasehold in the Permian. The acquisition includes an upfront payment $5.6 billion in Exxon Mobil shares plus additional continued cash payments totaling up to $1 billion based on development of the resource over a specified timeframe.", "The map on the left shows our heritage acreage in yellow, acreage acquired in transactions in 2014 and 2015 in blue and the acreage associated with the most recent transactions in red. As you can see, the new leasehold represents a significant position in the heart of the Delaware Basin. Less than 5% of the acquired resource has been developed to-date, providing substantial opportunity for future growth. As a result of our proven capabilities, we are well positioned to maximize the value of this resource. This acquisition will add an estimated 3.4 billion oil equivalent barrels in multiple stacked plays, 75% of which is liquids. The highly contiguous nature of the acreage will also provide significant cost advantages by combining XTO's low-cost execution capabilities with proprietary technology from Upstream Research Company.", "We plan to drill the longest laterals within the play which will maximize per well recoveries and help generate market leading development costs. More than 85% of the wells are expected to have lateral lengths two miles or longer because the acreage is not constrained by traditional land lease issues. This transaction increases ExxonMobil's inventory of Permian drill wells that yield at least a 10% rate of return at $40 per barrel to more than 4,500 wells. We currently produce more than 140,000 net oil equivalent barrels per day in the Permian and are operating 10 rigs. This is expected to move higher in 2017 as we begin activity on the newly acquired acreage.", "Moving now to slide 29. We continue to strengthen our downstream and chemical business through selected integrated investments in our facilities and operations. We recently completed investments in lubricants and chemical facilities in Louisiana that support our aviation lubricants business commissioning a new state-of-the-art jet oil manufacturing facility in October of last year. The new plant will use Group V synthetic base stocks sourced from facilities that started up last year at our adjacent Baton Rouge chemical plant. Across the fuels, lubricants and chemical value chains, we continued to high grade our portfolio and reduce complexity to efficiently capture market value while reducing operational risk and capital expenditures. In the quarter, we reached agreements to divest several downstream affiliates in Africa and South America.", "Additionally, as I mentioned earlier, Imperial Oil completed their conversion of its retail business to a branded wholesaler model. This model benefits from significantly lower capital requirements while continuing to grow retail sales. We also continue to enhance our logistics capabilities by focusing on strategic midstream assets. We recently announced the formation of a joint venture with Sunoco Logistics that will expand access to domestic crude oils by improving transportation options from the Permian and Ardmore basins to the U.S. Gulf Coast refineries.", "In Baytown, at Mont Belvieu, Texas, the construction of our new 1.5 million ton per annum ethane steam cracker and associated metallocene polyethylene facility is progressing well with phase startup commencing in the second half of this year.", "Finally, ExxonMobil recently announced a new project at our Beaumont, Texas facility to expand polyethylene capacity by 650,000 tons per year. This expansion amounts to 65% increase in polyethylene capacity at the site. Together, the projects at Beaumont and Mont Belvieu represent multibillion dollar investments that will increase ExxonMobil's U.S. polyethylene production by nearly two million tons per year or 40% making Texas our largest polyethylene supply point. The new facilities will process advantaged ethane feedstock to meet growing global chemical demand.", "Moving to the final chart on slide 30. I would like to conclude today's comments with a brief summary of our 2016 performance, which is really underpinned by our sustained focus on value. ExxonMobil earned $7.8 billion in the year, while managing through a challenging business environment. Corporation delivered on its plan to produce 4.1 million oil equivalent barrels per day and maintained focus on business fundamentals. Volume contributions from our portfolio of new developments underscore our project execution excellence and reputation as a reliable operator.", "Total CapEx was $19.3 billion, down 38% from 2015 as we exercised capital discipline and investment selectivity and continued to pursue market and execution efficiencies. Solid operating performance combined with continued investment and cost discipline generated cash flow from operations and asset sales of $26.4 billion and positive free cash flow of $9.7 billion. As I mentioned in the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations and asset sales more than cover the dividend and net investments in the business. Our commitment to shareholders remain strong as demonstrated by our reliable and growing dividend. We are confident in ExxonMobil's integrated business model and our ability to continue to grow long-term value in any business environment. I will discuss our forward plans in more detail at the upcoming Analyst Meeting, which will take place at the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, March 1.", "That concludes my prepared remarks on a very busy year. And now I would be happy to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Woodbury. [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.", "Neil Mehta", "Good morning Jeff.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Good morning Neil.", "Neil Mehta", "Jeff, I appreciate the incremental disclosure here on the Delaware transaction. That's where I want to start. As you think about that deal, is it indicative of the view that Exxon has that you see more value in, let's say, the private market than the public market? And can you just talk a bit more about the opportunity you see in U.S. unconventional to do deals?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes. Neil, it's a good question. I would tell you that I would not view it as being exclusive to one type of transaction. As we have talked in the past, we keep a full view on what may be out there that could be competitive with our existing resource base and accretive to overall long-term financial performance. You know, these things don't happen overnight. Several of these take many, many months to go ahead and put in place and not all of them transpire into an executed deal, but what's important is that it is a key aspect of our overall asset management program in order to high grade our portfolio with the view of our underlying mission of growing shareholder value.", "Neil Mehta", "I appreciate that. And then my follow-up, Jeff, is on CapEx. I imagine we are going to get a little bit more color on this at the Analyst Day in a couple of weeks, but the $22 billion that you outlined is in line with what you talked about earlier this year, but up from 2016. Can you speak high level to what's driving the growth in 2017 versus 2016 in terms of CapEx? Is that cost inflation? Or is that higher growth? And then bigger picture, can you talk about what you are seeing in terms of cost inflation across your portfolio?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes. Well, Neil, as you indicated, we do plan on giving a lot more detail around our investment plans in the analyst presentation that will be just a little bit more in a month from now. As you indicated, the $22 billion that I mentioned is fairly consistent with our forward-looking plan that we provided a year ago. I would tell you that it does not reflect a year-on-year increase associated with cost inflation and in fact the inverse is true is that the organization continues to look for high impact capital efficiencies to drive the cost down and it is, by and large, a function of activity level. Certainly as activity continues to build, we will all experience some market pressures, but that doesn't relieve us of our fundamental objective of maximizing the value proposition and rest assure that the organization will continue to keep focused on what new solutions are there for us to get to a lower cost outcome and the organization is very committed to make sure that we are capturing those and really leading the cost curve.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.", "Phil Gresh", "Hi Jeff. Good morning.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Good morning Phil.", "Phil Gresh", "I wanted to start on the working capital and other headwind, $2.4 billion in the quarter, $8 billion for the year. It's a pretty big number. I guess I was just wondering if you could maybe elaborate or break that down a little more between deferred taxes and some of the other items? And moving forward how do you think about the ability to lessen that headwind in 2017.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Well, I mean obviously there's really two large components that are driving it. Obviously the changes in the working capital, by and large, adjustments in receivables and payables due to activity and changes in commodity prices and then the second part of other balance sheet items, some of that associated with deferred taxes. As I said, it also includes cash contributions that we made to the pension plan. So a lot of moving pieces, as is understandable. And I understand the interest, but that's about all the color I have for you at this point.", "Phil Gresh", "Okay. And then in terms of priorities with cash from here, to the extent you have excess free cash flow above the dividend in 2017, is the first priority, with the trending balances where they are, would it be debt paydown or do you feel like you have flexibility to do other things?", "Jeff Woodbury", "I think it's a function of the business climate and the opportunities that we have for ourselves. As you have heard us say before, if you think about our capital allocation approach, it's a commitment to provide a reliable and growing dividend to our shareholders and at the same time continue to selectively invest in our business with opportunities we believe are going to enhance the long-term return of the corporation. The excess cash, by and large, we don't want to hold large cash balances that we don't have immediate need for it. We will think about either paying down debt or buying back shares and that is done primarily on a quarterly basis. The corporation will step back and look at a number of factors like our current financial position, our potential opportunities to put capital to work as well as what we see in the near term in terms of the business outlook.", "Phil Gresh", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.", "Doug Leggate", "Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Good morning Jeff.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Good morning Doug.", "Doug Leggate", "Jeff, I wonder if I could kick off with your capital guidance. I guess it's kind of a follow-up. But ask you if could you move it on to talk a little bit about the production capacity that you see that goes along with that capital, because I am assuming the Permian is part of it? What I am really driving at is, you have got a number of projects still ramping up, so could you give us some idea as to what the remaining capacity is of those ramp-ups? In other words, what would the delta be if those projects were running full out in 2017? And then I have got a follow-up, please.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes. Doug, I mean first observation would be is that you are correct that we have projects that started up all the way back to early 2015 that are still well within their development drilling programs are ramping up to plateau production rate. Some of these things could take 12 to 24 months to fully reach the plateau production rate. I don't have a specific number for you as to what is that incremental capacity that's left to ramp up, but I will also highlight that a number of those projects also are exceeding design expectations due to really strong management by the organization around reliability and reservoir performance. We talked about Papa New Guinea in the past, a design at about 6.9, it's now produced above eight million tons per annum. You have heard in the news about Banyu Urip which the development basis was about 165,000 barrels a day. We have been producing about a 185,000 and it is now under review to take it all the way up to 200,000 barrels a day. Again very, very strong operational reliability and very good reservoir performance. So the point I am making is above the additional ramp up that's anticipated from the major project startups, there is also another layer of capacity that we are building on based on the organization's focus on the operational capabilities of our assets.", "Doug Leggate", "Okay. Just to be clear, Jeff, on the Permian piece of that, I think at the time of the acquisition you talked about moving to a 15-rig program. What's the starting point for that? What are you running right now?", "Jeff Woodbury", "So you are talking about the recent acquisition, I believe?", "Doug Leggate", "Right.", "Jeff Woodbury", "So let me back up and first I say that if you look at the overall development of the new acreage, we see that over the long term it would support a multi-decade production plateau of about 350,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. So a very substantial addition to liquids production as well and in fact if I can put it in scale for you, if you remember, in my prepared comments, I said that our current liquids production from XTO represents about 12% of the corporation's global liquids production. If you were just to add on the expectation from the Delaware acreage, that would take us up somewhere between 20% to 25% of our global liquids production. So the point being is, it's a very material part of the portfolio. As I indicated, we have got 10 rigs running right now. We are planning on ramping up that activity over the near future. But what we would do is, commensurate with the leasehold development requirements, we are very, very positive about this obviously given the acquisition and we want to get to it right away.", "Doug Leggate", "Jeff, I appreciate the answer. My follow-up is a very quick one. Payara, I think in Guyana, the limited disclosure you have given us so far, I guess, has raised some questions about potential scale. Is there anything you can tell us about relative scale or absolute scale of both the Liza and Payara reserve expectations ultimately but also like the development plan on both and the outlook of production system? And I will live it there. Thanks.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes, Doug. So, as we indicated in the third quarter, given the Liza-3 appraisal well, that really built confidence in a view that we have got at least a billion barrels of recoverable reserve. Since then, we have drilled a deeper zone that added additional volume, as I indicated in the prepared comments. Payara, we are very pleased with the outcome. We moved very quickly two drill additional sidetracks in order to better define the reservoir. And as I said, I think the next critical piece of information will be this well test we are starting right now. And that will allow us to size Payara. Now obviously, as we move along in each operational activity, that data is feeding our real time development planning effort to assess the full development scope of the block. And remember, we have got two other blocks that we will have to integrate as well. But right now, we are moving forward with the initial phase development. As we have said previously, it's 100,000 barrel a day FPSO. We do feel like that's a prudent step, very good strong returns and right now, we view that as just the initial phase.", "Doug Leggate", "Okay. I will wait till the Analyst Day. Thanks, Jeff.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Thank you, Doug.", "Operator", "We will go next to John Herrlin with Societe Generale.", "John Herrlin", "Yes. Hi. Two quick ones for me, Jeff. Regarding your CapEx, is that just strictly E&D or you are including the acquisition costs for Bass?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Well, John, on the Permian acquisition, remember we are purchasing that via shares. So it excludes that share purchase.", "John Herrlin", "Okay. Well, it would still be part of the costs incurred at the end of the day, but that's fine. Next on Payara, is that age correlative with the upper Liza pay or the lower Liza pay or can you not say anything on that?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes. I really don't have anything to share on that at this point.", "John Herrlin", "Okay. That's it. Thank you.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI.", "Doug Terreson", "Good morning Jeff.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Good morning Doug.", "Doug Terreson", "Just for clarification, is it correct that the $2.1 billion in asset sale gains were after tax and included in the $1.7 billion earnings figure and either way, could you provide some guidance as to which operating segments that these gains came from?", "Jeff Woodbury", "So the proceeds of $2.1 billion are -- you are asking about the proceeds that we had in the press release?", "Doug Terreson", "Correct.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes. Those are before tax proceeds.", "Doug Terreson", "Okay.", "Jeff Woodbury", "And then those proceeds are primarily within our downstream portfolio. I would say about over 80% of it, it's in the downstream.", "Doug Terreson", "Okay.", "Jeff Woodbury", "And the largest part of that is in the Canada retail sales.", "Doug Terreson", "Can you give guidance on after-tax?", "Jeff Woodbury", "On the proceeds?", "Doug Terreson", "Yes.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Now I don't have any numbers to share with you on that.", "Doug Terreson", "Okay. And then also, three of your competitors have taken steps to enhance their pay for performance linkage by changing the metrics that they are using for their business units to ones which tie to intrinsic value in the stock market and probably CEO pay too. And while your stock has outperformed some of these companies in the equity market over the years, my question is, how is the company thinking about P-for-P this year and specifically where there is a need for change given its rising profile as a corporate governance issue with investors?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Well, if you remember -- you are talking about our executive compensation program?", "Doug Terreson", "I am.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes. As you and I have talked in the past, remember that a large part of our compensation program is based on a long-term payment schedule and it is intended in order to make sure that our executives are being held to the decisions that we are making over the long term. And our long-term incentive is paid over a 10-year period, 50% about 5 years. The remaining 50% after 10 years, really it's the later of 10 years or retirement. So some of us go even beyond 10 years, but it's really designed to ensure that our executives feel the same performance that our investors feel because when it does payout, it's paid out at the current stock price. Now I will tell you that the compensation committee does step back and look at the program periodically to make sure that it's ensuring, it's encouraging the right type of behaviors and it's recognizing the success of the corporation. For those that are listening about it, we have got, what we call an executive compensation overview disclosure that we send out annually that provide a lot of good detail about the structure of the program.", "Doug Terreson", "Okay. Thanks a lot, Jeff.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Doug, just a follow-up on your question regarding the Canadian retail. As I said in my prepared comments, it was $522 million after tax.", "Doug Terreson", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "We will go next to Sam Margolin with Cowen and Company.", "Sam Margolin", "Good morning Jeff. How are you?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Good morning Sam.", "Sam Margolin", "So late in the quarter, you finally got FERC approval for Golden Pass. I guess I would add that to the bucket in one of the later slides about de-lengthening your U.S. nat-gas position, maybe. So I was wondering, I am sure you have made comments on this before, but how do you think now in the new environment or how things have played out currently, how U.S. LNG competes with some of your other world-scale LNG potential assets around the world? And how do you think about that moving forward as you want to develop additional U.S. gas assets in the context of that?", "Jeff Woodbury", "It's a good question, Sam. The best place to start is really thinking about it from our overall energy outlook and our supply and demand balances. Over the long term, we expect that LNG capacity or demand will continue to grow. In fact, almost it's up to like 250% of today's LNG net capacity. A large part of that growth is primarily driven by Asia. Now like most commodities, you are going to have periods in which there is oversupply and periods where there is insufficient supply. And we do expect that with the number of projects coming on that there are some projects where there is period in which they will see LNG over supply. Now if I step back from that that's, if you will, the value proposition and I step back, we have got a very extensive portfolio and I would tell you that brownfield developments that is incremental investments to existing operations like Papa New Guinea or even Golden Pass provide us economic advantage by lowering the cost by leveraging the installed investment. At Golden Pass, as you noted, we did get FERC approval. The one key step that we are still waiting for after many years is final Department of Energy approval of non-FTA export authorization. And we are hopeful that that will come shortly. But each one of these projects will be evaluated on their own merit. As you have heard us say previously, as it relates to LNG projects, we want to lock in a large part of that capacity on long-term contracts. And Golden Pass, within the whole portfolio of investment opportunities that we have, we are pursuing long-term sales contracts. But they all will be evaluated on their own merits.", "Sam Margolin", "Okay. I guess my follow-up then, is on the same topic. It might be a similar answer on sort of an individual project analysis basis, but as you look within your 30-year outlook and a lot of energy demand globally is driven by gas and against the backdrop of early this year, the de-booking of some natural gas reserves domestically and an imperative to get those rebooked over time, what do you think is more preferable between uses of that gas for you? Investing in shipping it to these Asian demand centers via LNG? Or keeping it onshore and consuming it within your chemical business?", "Jeff Woodbury", "That's a good question. It really highlights and talks to the issue of optionality. We are the largest gas producer in the U.S. Where do we see that gas going in the future, again stepping back from that energy outlook, we expect gas is going to grow about 1.5% per year. That's primarily driven by two things, one, power generation and the second thing petrochemicals. As you know, we have got a very integrated value chain. The anticipation is that resource will not only meet domestic growth and power generation, but we will also look at the utilization of that into our value chain in the chemicals business as well as, well, we started this discussion around LNG export, so optionality gives us tremendous amount of flexibility to make sure that we are maximizing the value proposition.", "Sam Margolin", "All right. Thanks Jeff.", "Jeff Woodbury", "You bet.", "Operator", "We will go next to Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.", "Evan Calio", "Hi. Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Good morning.", "Evan Calio", "I have a question. Any outlook on future project returns, conventional versus your acquired Permian? And I ask the question in the context that you make a significant acquisition in one of the tighter energy asset markets in the world, the Permian. You discuss a relatively healthy future plateau level of production, while there's distress in asset markets globally in regions in which Exxon operates. So I mean just given the assets and these longer laterals you discussed, can you talk about how you think the future returns compete within your portfolio or how advantaged they may be?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Well, from a general perspective, Evan, I would tell you that clearly the recent acquisition, predominantly in the Delaware Basin, is a very competitive. It really goes back to the fundamental objective that we are trying to achieve through acquisitions or through exploration or our investment program that is to make sure that we continue to maintain a focus on value accretive performance. So we are looking for investments that are going to continue to maintain our industry-leading return on capital employed. So certainly very attractive. We have given you sense for the economics where I think back in the second quarter we showed you some of the progress we have made in unit development cost, operating cost. We gave you a sense for the portfolio then, which with the Bakken improvement together, we had over 2,000 wells that achieved greater than 10% return, money forward economics, full and fully loaded on a $40 per barrel price. You add this acquisition into this, it takes us up to about 4,500 wells. So a very robust inventory. The long-term objective, thinking about the short cycle versus long cycle is one of making sure that the pace maximizes the learnings that we are integrating and captures a technology application that we want to apply in order to achieve these outcomes like the length of the laterals. But I would say that this acquisition and the investments that we plan under it are going to be very competitive to our existing inventory of opportunities.", "Evan Calio", "Can you even mention how much of your expected CapEx, $22 million CapEx, is in shorter cycle, however you define that, whether offshore or onshore? And related, how do you consider the value of capital flexibility or cycle times in your gating process, either as a plus or a minus for a longer cycle project?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes. On the first question, I would tell you that we are going there to provide some more color in about a month's time at the Analyst Meeting. So if I ask you to just to hold that thought, we will give you a little bit more perspective at that time.", "On the second one, the overall balance of short cycle versus long cycle, obviously we have got a very large resource inventory with over 90 billion barrels. We are trying to move that resource inventory at the same time maintaining a robust level of short cycle investments. Now, of course, that short cycle inventory continues to grow with all these acquisitions that we have been picking up. So that's done through our annual planning process. We look at the execution capability of the organization, the service sector and then we look at the fundamental cash management objective is to make sure that we have got that flexibility and a key element of when we share a CapEx objective, we have built in flexibility to the upside as well as flexibility to the downside. We know how to flex that program depending on what commodity prices do.", "Evan Calio", "I appreciate it.", "Operator", "We will go next to Jason Gammel with Jefferies.", "Jason Gammel", "Thanks. Hi Jeff. Jeff, I note that in the third quarter press release, you talked about the potential for needing to take some negative revisions to proved reserves in the oil sands and clearly, at least in the quarter, you haven't taken any financial impairments to those assets. Can you talk about whether you would still view those proved reserves as potentially needing to be written down? Or whether the price recovery into the end of the year was sufficient to allow those to remain on the books?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes. It's a good question. Again, I want to make sure that everybody's very clear that there is a separation between proved reserves reporting under the SEC rules and then the whole issue of asset impairments. And really what you are asking, Jason, is I think clearly the question about proved reserves.", "In the third quarter we indicated, because we thought it was prudent at the time given where crude prices were that we indicated that we were likely going to take as much 4.6 billion barrels out of proved and put them in our resource base. And I will remind you that I emphasized at that time that even though we make that transfer, there is no change to our operations or how we manage the business, those assets going forward. We will be announcing our final year-end reserves here in the next couple of weeks as we typically do. In short, we do expect to reflect most of the SEC pricing impact that we discussed in the third quarter, but I will also note that we anticipate that there will be some partial offsets to those numbers. So stay tuned, we will be finalizing that shortly and we will be releasing that information here in the next two weeks.", "Jason Gammel", "I appreciate that, Jeff. And then just as a follow-up, the InterOil acquisition that you announced this year, I am afraid I am a little bit lost on the process for actually completing the InterOil transaction. Can you talk about what is still outstanding there in order to get that deal done?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes. So we are going back through the process following a decision by Canadian courts and we have put in place a new amended agreement between InterOil and ExxonMobil. And I will just remind everybody that in the first process through, the InterOil Board fully unanimously approved this transaction and shareholders approved it by over 80%. So we are going back through the process and right now there is a shareholder vote anticipated in the middle of February. And then as in the last cycle through this, we will need to go back to the Yukon courts to make a final ruling on the offer and then hopefully close thereafter.", "Jason Gammel", "Great. Thanks Jeff. I appreciate that.", "Operator", "We will go next to Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.", "Ryan Todd", "Great. Thanks. Maybe if I could have a couple of quick follow-ups on capital budget. And I realize you are giving more details next month. But how should we think about capital allocation for the Lower 48 business with the addition of the Permian acquisition? Does that highlight a growing relative share of the capital budget by the U.S. on shore? Is it additive to your existing activity? Or should we expect to see the capital diverted away from areas like the Bakken in Oklahoma and be replaced by activity in the Permian?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Well, Ryan, we will certainly provide more color here in a month or so. But I mean, directionally, it's a fairly sizable acquisition that we are making in the Permian. We feel good about our acreage position in the other unconventional basins. I showed you a map where we have got a meaningful presence in everyone of them. As an indicative guidance, I would tell you that it's likely going to add additional CapEx to our short cycle investments in order to move forward on the acreage that we have picked up in acquisition.", "Ryan Todd", "Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then maybe just one on 2016 CapEx, which came in quite a bit lower than guidance early in the year. Any comments on what were the primary drivers? Is that cost deflation, deferral of activity, change in any expected scope in spend?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes. Thanks for asking the question, Ryan, because I think it does reflect very well on how the corporation responded and particularly our people and their focus on recognizing that we are in a down cycle and we have got a great opportunity to take advantage during that down cycle. I would say that it really is a function of a number of things. One is and it all is underpinned by our very strong focus around capital discipline. But it comes down to capital efficiency opportunities that we are able to continue to capture, regardless of where we are in the commodity price cycle. It includes market capture. We all know that the service sector and the related costs have dropped materially. Also importantly it has to do with the very strong project execution performance on our operated projects, most of which coming in on-budget and on-cost. And then there was an element of how we paced our projects for several reasons. One, recognizing the business climate, wanting to stay within our means. And two, in a low price environment, there is unique value that we are able to capture by going back and recycling through the development planning process on some of these projects to try to do things like reduce the cost structure, add additional resource to increase resource density, but it really is a opportunity in the down cycle to go ahead and add incremental value to those future investment.", "Ryan Todd", "Okay. Thanks Jeff.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.", "Paul Sankey", "Hi Jeff.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Good morning Paul.", "Paul Sankey", "Jeff, with the changes in Washington, I just wondered what Exxon has done to, firstly, I assume you guys are pro lifting sanctions on Russia. Secondly, I assume that you would be anti the border adjusted tax. And then finally, can you make any comments about the impact on your operations in Iraq from the recent limitations on travel there? I wondered if that was going to -- I assume that's going to directly impact you. Thanks.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes. I guess a couple of comments. We will continue to advocate for many of the areas you talked about, advocate for free market principles. When it comes down to the important discussion that's happening in Congress in the current administration around the tax code, we believe the tax code should be globally competitive. It should be predictable, stable, providing investment certainty and not picking winners and losers. So I mean, we will continue to stay principle based in our view on those matters.", "With respect to Russia, we will continue to fully comply with the existing sanctions and I am not going to speculate when or if they are fully satisfied and removed in the future. And then on Iraq and more broadly speaking some of the issues associated with decisions taken in the U.S., a key aspect wherever we are around the world, including Iraq, is the security of our people and our contractors and we have very dedicated effort within the organization to ensure that we are trying to stay in front of potential threats that the organization needs to respond to in order to ensure the safety and security of our assets and people. So I would rather not talk about specifics, but I will tell you that we are monitoring the situation very closely.", "Paul Sankey", "Understood. Jeff, if I could completely change subject, the President of Guyana was commenting earlier in the week that we could see production startup in 2019 from Liza. Is that reasonable, do you think? We have also obviously heard from Hess about a final investment decision this year. And if we look back to what you did in Angola as an example of your speed with which you can get these things up and running with the idea of getting very early cash flow, I wondered if you could handicap the chances that we do see first production much sooner than the, I think you have been talking more 2021?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes. It's a good question. Listen, I think first and foremost is that we are going to work with our co-ventures and the government to move this project along in the most efficient and expedient way. And all stakeholders have a role in deciding how this project moves forward. And we certainly understand the resource owners' interest and I will tell you, we are very attuned to it. As I indicated in my prepared comments, we think it is reasonable that the initial phase will move forward to an FID decision later this year. The guidance that we have been providing as well as consistent with the regulatory filings says that the initial phase would startup in 2020.", "Paul Sankey", "Got it, Jeff. Thank you.", "Jeff Woodbury", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Asit Sen with CLSA Americas.", "Asit Sen", "Good morning Jeff.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Good morning Asit.", "Asit Sen", "So thanks for the color on the short cycle versus long cycle. I just wanted to make sure I got the Permian numbers right. So the 140,000 barrels a day production now and your comment on the 350,000 barrels a day of plateau production from the recent Delaware acquisition, what time frame are we looking at?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Well, we have yet to share the specifics around the buildup of that. But as I indicated, Asit, we want to get at it quickly. But the 350,000 potential and that's oil equivalent barrels per day, we believe is a reasonable investment program that could be maintained over multi-decades.", "Asit Sen", "Got you. Okay. And my quick question on the new project startup, Barzan, is that a 2017 startup? And could you remind us on the working interest that you have there? 7% is that's what I have.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes. Our working interest is 7% and you really need to talk to the operator RasGas on specifics around the project.", "Asit Sen", "Great. Thanks Jeff.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Welcome.", "Operator", "We will go next to Paul Cheng with Barclays.", "Moses Sutton", "Hi. This is Moses Sutton, on for Paul. A quick question on the impairment charges. Have you completed the review of the entire portfolio? Or are certain assets still under review in 2017?", "Jeff Woodbury", "We have completed the review of the entire portfolio.", "Moses Sutton", "Great. Thank you. That's it from us.", "Jeff Woodbury", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "We will go next to Alastair Syme with Citi.", "Alastair Syme", "Hi Jeff. I also had a question on the impairment. If you look back at your most recent energy outlook, it looks like you have made some quite big changes around the expectation on North American tight oil and gas. Is it possible to relate those changes back to today's impairment decision? It feels like you expect there's going to be a lot of growth in associated gas, for instance.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Well, I mean it's good question, Alastair, but I would tell you, the first point I would make is the reason why we do an annual updated energy outlook is really to make sure that we are most informed about the fundamental building blocks that really underpin that demand projection. The changes that you are asking about is really a function of a number of factors. It's not just energy outlook. We do this in conjunction with our annual budget and plans process. And it also is of the function as part of the energy outlook is looking at the competitiveness of different resources that underpin that demand outlook. So it's a number of factors that will drive our decisions and ultimately the choices that we make.", "Alastair Syme", "Thank you. As a follow-up, can I ask, can you explain what non-U.S. tax effects are on the corporate items? Are these upstream or downstream items?", "Jeff Woodbury", "The non-U.S. tax items are really across a number of the business segments, but the largest in the fourth quarter were primarily in the upstream business.", "Alastair Syme", "Is it possible to get any color what they relate to?", "Jeff Woodbury", "No, we don't have any additional information to share.", "Alastair Syme", "Okay. Thanks very much, Jeff.", "Jeff Woodbury", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "We will go next to Brendan Warren with BMO Capital Markets.", "Brendan Warren", "Thanks Jeff. Just first question, just on those five major project startups. You flagged 2017 into 2018, particularly with Hebron and Sakhalin that you do operate. Are they still in 2017, recognizing Hebron most recently said it was on track for end-2017. I have a follow-up as well. Thanks.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes. That's correct. They are currently on plan to achieve those objectives.", "Brendan Warren", "Okay. So they are both in before end-2017. And then my follow-up refers and you would probably say defer this to the capital markets day, but if I refer back to slide 33 from the capital markets day, you had given guidance of cash flow from operations and asset sales for 2016 with a range at $40 a barrel to $80 a barrel. It looks like at $45 average for this year, you have just come in where the $40 a barrel line should be. I am trying to reconcile, you had a weaker cash flow number for 2016. And whether that changes your view for 2017 in terms of cash flow from operations?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes. Brendan, a good question. An important dialog that we think is something that we should be talking to and we will update that chart you are referring to in the upcoming Analyst Day here within a month and be ready to talk more about it with our current views.", "Brendan Warren", "Okay. Thanks Jeff.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Welcome.", "Operator", "We will go next to Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.", "Ed Westlake", "Yes. Good morning at top of the hour here. Two questions, I guess. Firstly, decline rates. I mean you guys have done very well on the production side to minimize base decline. You have got long duration assets in a number of geographies. Maybe just a quick update as far out as you could go on expected decline rate on the base business.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes. So we assess our long-term decline rate over every year and in fact, it's in our 10-K. And what we have had in terms of a decline rate here in the recent past, last couple of years, has been 3%. And let me just qualify that 3% as being that does not include project activity. So if we were to stop our investment program, that's what we would have.", "Ed Westlake", "Yes.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Okay.", "Ed Westlake", "And then we haven't really had a conversation around OpEx and margins, maybe deferred tax maybe to the prior question on cash flow as you go forward, but maybe just a word on how much more savings you can get on OpEx? The new projects, are they accretive to margins? And then what you expect to happen to deferred taxes as prices bump up a little here?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes. A really good question in terms of OpEx and how we are managing that. I would tell you that we are never satisfied. We clearly understand there's been a lot of progress here over the last two years, but I can tell you that the organization doesn't believe status quo is sufficient. As I alluded to previously, we will continue to look for structural opportunities. We will continue to be very focused on our organizational effectiveness. And importantly, we will continue to work with the service sector to come up with lower cost, higher quality opportunities. And I am sure if the activity continues to build, there is going to be market pressures, but we are going to continue to work against those market pressures to capture incremental value.", "On deferred income taxes in the future, there's really nothing more I can share with you. You can appreciate some of this has to do with the current low price environment that have been through here last couple years.", "Ed Westlake", "And margin should also improve with the new projects coming on, presumably?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Well, that's the objective of the investment program. Thanks, Ed.", "Operator", "We will go next to Theepan Jothilingam with Exane BNP.", "Theepan Jothilingam", "Yes. Hi. Good morning Jeff. Thanks for taking my questions. I had two actually. Firstly, could you talk about, I know you are intending to issue equity for the recent Permian transaction. Is there any thoughts about buying back to offset that dilution? And my second question, just in terms of exploration for 2017. I know the focus is on Guyana, but could you talk about any other high impact place for 2017 and the spend associated? Thank you.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes. So Theepan, on the fundamental question of, to me, I interpret it as whether we would buy back any stock and I will go back to our earlier discussion around it. It's really a quarterly decision that management makes based on a number of variables that I have already described. And as I said in the prepared comments, we don't anticipate doing any type of buybacks, other than into to address anti-dilutive impacts associated with the benefits programs and plans.", "On other exploration focus, we expect for the near term, flat spend out to out through the next several years, but I have shared a number of key areas that we are focusing our attention. Cypress, the high quality block we have got there on Block 10 that we have entered in negotiations on the production sharing contract, but we are very encouraged by it. Mexico, the Block 1 that we picked up, which is right along the U.S. border adjacent to some U.S. acreage that we have got. Again, very encouraged by it, putting plans in place. I indicated that we continue to expand to our exploration acreage position in Papa New Guinea. You think about some of the big high potential areas for us, Papa New Guinea is very important to us. Guyana, that area has been very important to us. And then as we have been talking about often on today is the unconventional business with a very strong focus on the liquids potential. So I think it really does make a very strong statement around the value proposition that we are trying to deliver to our shareholders.", "Theepan Jothilingam", "Okay. Thanks Jeff. I was just wondering, when you think about potential acquisition add between equity and adding debt, could you talk about how the market should think about that? Should we see if there are opportunities Exxon uses paper rather than debt?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes. Well, it's going to be case specific. I mean the important message for you to understand is that we have the flexibility to do either. The final structure of a given transaction is really a function of the dialog between the parties with the focus of what the seller wants from the transaction. But I wouldn't read anymore into it relating to our capital structure.", "Theepan Jothilingam", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.", "Pavel Molchanov", "Thanks for taking the question guys. Just two quick ones. You mentioned that almost all of the increase towards the $22 billion CapEx budget reflects higher activity. Can you be a little more specific on what service cost inflation you are assuming, particularly in your North American CapEx?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Pavel, as I indicated earlier, we are going to provide more color around our investment plans in about a month's time in the Analyst Meeting. I would just ask you to hold out until we get to that point.", "Pavel Molchanov", "Okay. And as far as the InterOil closing process, you are currently doing the rerun of the shareholder vote. Should the Yukon court bock the second attempt, as they blocked the first one, is there any other alternative in your mind to getting shareholder approval?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes, well, I mean let me not speculate as to how this will progress. Very strong support from the shareholders of InterOil. This is a process that InterOil is running and we think that we have addressed some of the comments that were made in the first process. So let's let that go through and then we will decide how we move forward from there.", "Pavel Molchanov", "All right. I appreciate it.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we have no further questions in the queue at this time.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Well, I want to thank everybody for their participation today and I really do appreciate your time and the questions. We appreciate your continues interest in ExxonMobil and we really do look forward to visiting with you next month at the Analyst Meeting. So until then, we will keep very focused on our fundamental mission of growing long-term shareholder value. Thank you.", "Operator", "And that concludes today's conference.

Please go ahead.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome to Exxon Mobil's first quarter earnings call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our Web site. Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2.", "Now turning to Slide 3, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines for first quarter performance. Exxon Mobil earned $1.8 billion in a difficult business environment marked by low commodity prices. Cash flow from operations and asset sales totaled $5 billion in the quarter. These results demonstrate the durability of our integrated business enhanced by our relentless focus on managing those factors that we can control, including effect of cost management, reliable performance and operational integrity. The highlight this quarter is our strong chemical results which underscored significant gas and liquids cracking advantages at our integrated sites and differentiated capabilities across the value chain.", "Corporation also continues to make steady progress on its investment plans. During the quarter we benefited from recent capacity additions while reducing CapEx 33% versus the prior year quarter. We continue to effectively manage our spending while selectively investing in the business to meet long-term energy demand and importantly grow shareholder value.", "Moving now to Slide 4, we will provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Global economic growth remained weak during the first quarter. In the U.S. estimates indicate growth has slowed further since late 2015. In China growth continued to decelerate however economies in Japan and Europe showed some modest improvement compared to the fourth quarter. Crude oil prices were quite volatile and decreased relative to last year while natural gas prices continued to fall. Global refining margins weakened on lower distilled demand and continued surplus inventory. However chemical commodity and specialty margins strengthened on lower feed and energy costs.", "Turning now to the financial results as shown on Slide 5, as indicated, Exxon Mobil\u2019s first quarter earnings were $1.8 billion or $0.43 per share. Corporation distributed $3.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders. CapEx was just over $5 billion down 2.6 billion from the first quarter of 2015 reflecting continued steady progress on our investment plans. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $5 billion and at the end of the quarter cash totaled $4.8 billion and debt was 43.1 billion.", "Next slide provides additional detail on sources and uses of cash. So over the quarter cash balances increased from $3.7 billion to $4.8 billion. Earnings adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items, and our ongoing asset management program, yielded $5 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses of cash included shareholder distributions of $3.1 billion and net investments in the business of 4.5 billion. Debt and other financing increased cash by $3.7 billion which included the impact of anti dilutive share purchases.", "Exxon Mobil will continue to limit your purchases to amounts needed to offset dilution related to our benefits plan and programs but does not currently plan on making additional purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Earlier this week the Board of Directors declared a second quarter of cash dividend of $0.75 per share a 2.7% increase from last quarter marking our 34th consecutive year of per share dividend growth.", "Moving on to Slide 7 for a review of our segmented results, Exxon Mobil's first quarter earnings decreased $3.1 billion from a year ago quarter, lower Upstream and Downstream earnings were partially offset by stronger chemical results, and lower corporate costs. The corporate effective tax rate was 19% during the quarter down from 33% a year ago reflecting changes in our segment earnings mix and onetime favorable tax effects reported in the corporate and financing segment. On average corporate and financing expenses are anticipated to be $500 million to $700 million per quarter over the next few years.", "In a sequential quarter comparison shown on Slide 8, earnings decreased by $970 million as stronger chemical results, partly offset lower upstream and downstream earnings.", "Tuning now to the upstream financial and operating results starting on Slide 9, upstream earnings decreased $2.9 billion from a year ago quarter, resulting in a segment loss of $76 million. Sharply lower realizations decreased earnings by $2.6 billion. Crude prices declined by almost $18 per barrel and gas fell more than $2.25 per thousand cubic feet. Unfavorable sales mix effects reduced earnings $100 million, all other items decreased earnings another $250 million where lower gains on asset sales and less favorable tax effects were partly offset by reduced operating expenses.", "Moving to Slide 10, oil equivalent production increased 77,000 barrels per day or 1.8%, to more than 4.3 million barrels per day compared to the first quarter of last year. Our liquids production was up 260,000 barrels per day or 11.5% driven by capacity additions from recent project startups and continued good facility reliability across the portfolio. However, natural gas production decreased 1.1 billion cubic feet per day or 9.3%. Growth from major projects was more than offset by regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands, field decline, divestment impacts and lower entitlement volumes.", "Turning now to the sequential comparison starting on Slide 11, upstream earnings were $933 million lower than the fourth quarter. Realizations decreased earnings by $1.2 billion where crude declined more than $8 per barrel and gas fell almost $0.75 per thousand cubic feet. Favorable volume and sales mix effects improved earnings by $170 million including contributions from new projects and higher natural gas demand. All other items added $140 million reflecting lower operating expenses partly offset by lower favorable tax effects.", "Moving to Slide 12, sequentially volumes were also up 77,000 oil equivalent barrels per day or 1.8%. Liquids production increased almost 60,000 barrels per day, up 2.3% from ramp up of new project volumes. Natural gas production was up 120 million cubic feet per day reflecting stronger seasonal demand in Europe, partly offset by regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and lower entitlements.", "Moving now to the downstream results starting on Slide 13, downstream earnings for the quarter were $906 million a decrease 760 million compared to the first quarter of 2015. Weaker refining margins reduced earnings by 860 million, partly offset by 100 million of all other items, primarily favorable foreign exchange effects.", "Turning to Slide 14, sequentially, downstream earnings decreased $445 million as weaker margins reduced earnings by 470 million, unfavorable volume and mix effects mainly from increased European maintenance activities, decreased earnings by another $150 million. All other items provided a partial offset adding $170 million mostly from lower expenses.", "Moving now to chemical results starting on Slide 15, first quarter earnings were $1.4 billion up 370 million versus the prior year quarter. Stronger commodity margins from liquids cracking in Europe and Asia increased earnings by $250 million. Higher global sales volumes contributed $80 million while all other items added another $40 million again from lower expenses.", "Moving to Slide 16, sequentially chemical earnings increased $390 million due to stronger commodity and specialty margins. Unfavorable volume and mix effects were more than offset by lower expenses.", "Turning now to Slide 17, as you may be aware Standard & Poor\u2019s reduced its credit rating on Exxon Mobil by one notch to AA positive with a stable outlook. Earlier this month Moody's reaffirmed its AAA credit rating on the Corporation with a negative outlook. We want to be clear that nothing has changed with respect to the Corporation\u2019s conservative financial philosophy or prudent management of its balance sheet. Our ability to access financial markets on attractive terms remains strong. Exxon Mobil's financial strength remains a significant competitive advantage and enables us to create long-term shareholder value despite near-term market volatility. Exxon Mobil's has a long history of prudently managing our capital structure and financial capacity through numerous commodity cycles and fully expect to manage through this one under those same prudent financial principles.", "Moving now to Slide 18 in an update on upstream projects in the exploration program, four major projects startups year-to-date added 170,000 oil equivalent barrels per day of working interest production capacity. In January the Heidelberg project in the Gulf of Mexico, started up several months ahead of schedule and under budget. Heidelberg is a five well subsea development in 5,300 feet of water tied back to a central trust bar production facility with the peak capacity of 80,000 barrels of liquids and 80 million cubic feet of gas per day.", "In Australia Train 1 or the Gorgon LNG project started out in March as you know LNG production has been suspended due to mechanical issues which the operators are actively working to resolve. In April Exxon Mobil started up two more projects ahead of schedule and under budget, Julia in the Gulf of Mexico and a Point Thomson initial production system on Alaska's North Slope. Julia is a capital efficient subsea tie back to an existing production facility another example of Exxon Mobil's capability to cost effectively develop new deepwater resources by leveraging existing infrastructure. Production will continue to ramp up in the coming months as two additional wells are completed.", "At the Point Thomson project two injection wells will work in tandem with the production well cycling up to 200 million cubic feet of gas per day to an onsite central processing facility to extract about 10,000 barrels per day of condensate. Notably the project provides a foundation for future gas development on the North Slope and further demonstrates Exxon Mobil's ability to safely and responsibly execute complex projects in challenging and remote environments. Two additional major projects are expected to come online later this year namely Kashagan and Barzan closing out to six major projects start ups planned for 2016.", "Turning now to our exploration program where we continue to pursue and evaluate high value resource opportunities. Offshore Guyana, we completed the largest proprietary 3D seismic survey in our company's history and we are currently drilling the Liza-2 appraisal well. Data from the appraisal well and the 3D seismic will be used to evaluate the block\u2019s potential and development concepts. We do plan to drill additional exploration wells with existing rig.", "Offshore Uruguay, we are participating in the Raya-1 exploration well in Block 14, where we have a 35% interest. And in the Gulf of Mexico we were the apparent high bidder on five new exploration blocks and lease sale 241. Final award of these blocks expected later this year and we will further strengthen our 1.1 million net acre position offshore. Branded utilized proprietary seismic imaging technology and continue to build the portfolio of attractive future drilling opportunities. So in conclusion Exxon Mobil remains focused on creating value through the cycle. We are advancing self help initiatives, driving down costs, increasing efficiency, proving reliability and capturing incremental across the integrated portfolio.", "First quarter Corporation earned 1.8 billion in a difficult business climate benefitting from structural advantageous in our downstream and chemical operations. Integrated business generated $5 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales. We continue to successfully progress our investment plans, increasing upstream production volumes for 4.3 million oil equivalent barrels per day, while reducing CapEx and upholding our reputation as a reliable operator. Exxon Mobil paid $3.1 billion in dividends during the quarter sharing the Corporation's success directly with our shareholders and we remain steadfast in our commitment to pay a reliable and growing dividend.", "That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Woodbury. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is comes from Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI.", "Doug Terreson", "In the downstream volume for both gasoline and diesel seemed to be weaker than the industry markers during the quarter and also over the past year, so my question is twofold, one how much of the weakness can be attributed to items such as divestitures unscheduled downtime whether et cetera, meaning what is the real apples-to-apples comparison for the company and then two, with these results, I wanted to see if you had a little bit more color or maybe more specific read through into the key economies around the world, and you touched on at the outset, but just want to see if you had a little bit more specifics in that area?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes, I think on the first item, I'd tell you just stepping back a little bit on the downstream, our fuel margins were weaker with distillate being at five year lows due to as you are much aware global surplus capacity and high commercial inventories and obviously that was aggravated by warm winter in the low heating oil demand and particularly in the U.S. less demand in the energy sector, although gasoline margins remain strong and demand is growing above capacity growth. We saw as I said in my prepared comments that from a volume perspective, we had increased maintenance activity predominantly in Europe, in the first quarter of this year if you compare it sequentially first quarter to fourth quarter, we had a much higher load on planned maintenance, I'll say broadly speaking Doug in 2016 our overall planned maintenance would be lower than 2015, but we will have a fairly heavy first half.", "Doug Terreson", "And then maybe a read through a little bit more specific read through into the global economy, I mean there numbers were weak I think you highlighted that but do you have anything else to add to your comments earlier?", "Jeff Woodbury", "No I mean, I think I would step back more so from a macro on supply and demand and if you look at the last decade, overall demand has increased about 1 million barrels a day, maybe a little less in that and if you look at demand growth here in last two years plus this year, 2014, 2015 and into 2016 as to what we expect, we're seeing demand growth in excess of the 10 year demand growth. So, I think it's a good indication of pretty healthy demand increase, very consistent with our outlook for energy with oil growth growing about 0.6% per year and gas growing about 1.7% or 1.6% per year.", "Doug Terreson", "Okay and then second Jeff, the return on capital and valuation have declined versus the previous cycle for most energy companies and I think you have prompted one of your competitors to indicate that returns, even at the expense of growth would probably be their new path forward and so I'll resonate pretty clear that returns are still important for Exxon Mobil. But my question is whether there has been any specific movement towards maybe changing the future balance between spending and shareholder distribution or do you guys think that as pre-productive capital normalizes that the situation will resolve by itself. So how do you guys think about that?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes well from a macro perspective, as you know, we're constructive on oil and gas demand. We have maintained a very disciplined capital allocation approach for the longer term horizon that hasn't changed, we went through these down cycles before, we've built this business to be very durable in a low price environment and we've maintained a financial flexibility throughout in order to continue to take advantage of opportunities whether they're on the top of the cycle or at the bottom, the return on capital employed continues to be a very strong focus for us, you've heard us talk in the past about a strategic decision years back to go ahead and invest in a number of major upstream projects concurrently in order to capture very a unique value that probably no one else could capture, like Exxon Mobil. And that had a burden on the return on capital employed for a period of time but rest assured, all those investments are being tested across our average financial performance to ensure that we are adding accretive value and we still view the return on capital employed, there is a key metric in the end as to how effective our value choices are.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.", "Evan Calio", "Okay. My first question is on unconventionals, you are running close to 96 rigs at the peak of the life cycle down to 16 today, 4 in the Bakken and the Permian given the environment. I know you have presented a significant potential growth for Exxon, but I just want to understand how you -- and somewhat related to Terreson\u2019s question, how you think about increasing activity in a recovery I mean you have a lot of options, a rigorous process, is there an oil price, is it access cash flow target or even a fundamental outlook in supply demand that will drive your swing in this shorter cycle resource in a recovery that is?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes. Well let me ask you to think about it this way. And then it really for Exxon Mobil it really starts at the micro level with our view of supply and demand as I explained to Doug a moment ago we have been very constructive of long term energy demand. For our long cycle investments it's really a function project maturity that actually maximizes value best, keeping in mind our prudent financial management to ensure that we are meeting our commitments and maintaining financial flexibility. Now for the shorter cycle investments that you are really asking about, by and large it is the same but with a much narrower focus on the near term business climate. So it's not really a price trigger for us, it's really a combination of all the relevant factors to ensure that we are maintaining our very prudent financial management but same ensure that we have financial flexibility to continue to investment when opportunities come along. And as you know, I mean we are spending $23 billion this year, which represents a lot of investment activity.", "Evan Calio", "I know there is a great consistency to your approach through the cycles and through time. Do you see the allocation changing any way favoring a shorter cycle resource versus more conventional allocation given some of the changes that could be evident through the cycle, for few forward cycles and I will leave at that? Thanks.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes, I think Evan. It's a good question and probably worthy of a more deeper discussion sometime but I\u2019ll tell that the mix of shorter cycle and longer cycle has changed overtime, obviously as our inventory base grew in the lower 48 unconventional. But our fundamentals are how we manage the business hasn\u2019t changed at all and the choices that we are making are really driven by how do we maximize shareholder value? All these investments compete and as we have said previously, we are not opportunity constrained we have got a very, very deep inventory across the portfolio not only in the upstream but also in our downstream, and chemical business. And just making sure that when we progress a project and investment decision that we have identified the optimized value proposition for it and it's competing for that capital across the portfolio. So I wouldn\u2019t tell you that we ever set targets around segmenting the total investment program between long cycle and short cycle, it is just the factors I talked about a moment ago, making sure that we are -- the investments have matured that we believe we have maximized value and that we maintain prudent financial management to sure that we can meet all of our commitments and retain our financial flexibility. But we have got a very deep and diverse inventory of investment opportunities.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Brad Heffern from Royal Bank of Canada Capital Markets.", "Brad Heffern", "I was wondering if you could put a finer point on the chemical's performance during the quarter. It seemed like it's a little bit stronger than maybe the micro environment would have suggested, I think you cited cost savings or operating cost savings in your prepared remarks, but is there any more detail you can provide around it?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes, while there has been really good -- I mean you step back again here for a moment to also very constructive on chemical demand growth, grown about 1.5% of booked GDP and that really sets up the investment proposition going forward. If you look across the segment commodities have been growing pretty strong very tight particularly in Europe and Asia. Demand growth has been growing much quicker, and really sets up a really good investment proposition into the future. The margin benefit is primarily feed and energy dropping quicker than product realizations. I\u2019ll also say though that our gas crackers continue to be advantaged even though the liquid crackers margin improved the gas crackers here in North America continue to have a very advantaged feedstock slate that allows us to compete very strongly in the demand market globally.", "Brad Heffern", "And then looking at CapEx, I think the number for the quarter is pretty well below in terms of a run rate basis, the 2016 CapEx guidance, I am curious if you are expecting seasonality in that number or if there is a reason to expect that that\u2019s going to increase meaningfully going forward, or if you are actually truly below the CapEx on a run rate basis?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes, Brad. So, just to set the stage as you all remember our CapEx for 2016 is down 25% set at about $23 billion the organization has not taken their foot off to paddle they continue to work towards identifying capital efficiency opportunities we\u2019re still capturing market savings and importantly and I want to emphasize that we're delivering our major projects on schedule and on budget in many cases ahead of schedule and below budget all of that is translating into capital savings that you are seeing in the first quarter of this year. We are not going to change our capital guidance at this point but I'll tell you that we are we\u2019re making good progress. I'll just say for a moment that the organization has really responded to the low price environment in a very effective way, they keep very-focused throughout the cycle but particularly in the bottom of the cycle and have really risen to the occasion and continue to identify substantial opportunities for the Corporation to save both cash and OpEx.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Doug Leggate from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.", "Doug Leggate", "I also have a couple of questions if I may my first one is really about some more specific on the oil sands business, it's been a fairly large part of you\u2019re -- the project growth and the shift towards liquids and so on, but obviously in this environment I have to imagine it is a substantial drag on your cash margins so I'm just wondering if you could to the extent you can just give us some idea what the economics of Carol in your oil sands business generate Cold Lake and so on it looks like in this environment and what I'm really thinking about is the kind of free cash torque that could generate in a recovery scenario and I've got a follow up please?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes. Well I mean generally speaking the oil sands certainly no doubt profitability is compressed in this price environment but the organization once again keeps very-focused on the fundamental particularly our cost and reliability and they are making really good progress refining structural enhancements that create margin at the bottom line. If you think about the resource base that we've got in oil sands we've been working in the oil sands now for over three decades including technology development and on the mining side I think Carol is a great example where we applied proprietary technology that was able to reduce our capital investment our operating cost and improve our environmental footprint that will increase long-term value. The same is true for the in-situ operations I mean we've been optimizing our cyclic stream operations at Cold Lake for a long time and we are identifying additional technology benefits like solvent assisted steam assisted gravity drainage technology that will improve once again the recovery and lower our cost and improve our environmental footprint.", "I think it's a testament to how Exxon Mobil manages its portfolio, we work the project, management and execution very, very well and then when it starts up they just keep on working on that cost structure and create margin because we know we can't count on price, what we got to count on is the things that we control that being cost and reliability and our integrity of the operations, but the last point I\u2019d make is remember we also get value across the full value chain because our upstream is fully integrated with our downstream and chemical business.", "Doug Leggate", "Jeff. My follow up, I'm going to have a stab at this one and it might be a very short answer but on Guyana can I frame my question like this my understanding is that the appraisal well is something of a two stage effort stage one being treat before the drill sand test and I'm just curious to the extent you can share with us whether that well has achieved this objectives and the additional plans perhaps to bring a second rig in and any comments around the additional prospects that have been identified. I realize it's early but just looking for any update you can share on whether that well achieved its objective?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Sure, Doug. And I understand the interest that you and others have about Guyana. I mean we were certainly very encouraged by the discovery well the organization moved quickly to get a dealership contracted and get it onsite to appraise the Liza discovery the well spud in February we do plan to drill multiple wells this year. Liza-2 is progressing according to expectations, we will plan to test the well and we should complete that activity mid-year as I said in my prepared comments we did complete the 3D seismic survey on the Stabroek Block and we began a survey on the Canje block, which we picked up to the east of the Stabroek Block. The well and seismic data is being assessed real time in order to provide insights into the discovery and the ultimate block potential. We do plan on moving the rig from the Liza appraisal well over to a new prospect to the Northwest after it is done at Liza.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Sam Margolin from Cowen & Company.", "Sam Margolin", "There is actually quite a bit of enthusiasm developing for NGLs in the U.S. right now among the investor community, I was wondering, if you could offer sort of a -- how that might impact, an outlook on how that might impact Exxon going forward in the context of your sort of overall gas outlook, and you could even get more esoteric if you want regarding heat content and all the benefits that you might see in your unconventional gas business, would given the fact that, U.S. earnings, U.S. upstream earnings have been dragging a little bit here for the past few quarters?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes. Well it's a good question because it really highlights once again the benefits of the integrated business that we've got from the very large resource inventory and unconventionals in the U.S. all the way through to our chemical business, what's important is that we have built the chemical business to have a very wide flexible range of feedstock capability including ethane, propane, butane, all the way to gasoil. So, we've got significant flexibility within the chemical business to modify the feedstock in order to maximize margins, I'd say the same is true for Europe and Asia, particularly in Asia Pacific, in our Singapore refinery, cracker that we have an unprecedented range of feedstocks including the ability to crack crude oil which is an industry first.", "Sam Margolin", "And then secondly on M&A, I think Mr. Tillerson was pretty clear at the Analyst Day that the organization is not interested in kind of taking on encumbered assets but Exxon Mobil has pretty good currency here, and I was wondering just in the context of whatever S&P's reasoning was in the revision if there is an opportunity to maybe equitize through M&A or asset additions or if that's even a factor, considering Moody's still has the stable rating?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes, Sam, I'd tell you that nothing has really changed on how we manage our portfolio and asset management includes the potential for accretive assets through acquisitions. As we talked previously and as you heard from Rex that we keep very alert to where there are, potential value propositions a high grade or existing portfolio, we're only going to pursue those acquisitions that we think have strategic value and are going to be accretive to our long-term returns and it's got to compete with the existing inventory investment opportunities that we have got, we've got to be patient. We want to make sure that we keep a very wide aperture on what the opportunities look like, I think we've got a good handle on where there are opportunities but we need to make sure that it is value accretive to the business and once we are able to lock in on a opportunity like that you will hear about it.", "Operator", "And our next question is comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.", "Phil Gresh", "First question on the quarter, you mentioned some color on the tax rate, it sounds like you separated it into two pieces one was mix and the other was some one time effects in the corporate and financing segment, and it sounds like the corporate and financing piece you expect to kind of revert to the 500 million to 700 million a quarter, I was just curious maybe on the mix side, kind of what drove that and if you think about the full year tax rate, would you expect that to still be similar to last year at current oil price levels?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes, on the mix side, I'd tell you, it always has to do with the relative contribution between U.S. international between upstream, downstream and our chemical businesses and you can just sense from my comments that there was a lot of complexity in that. In terms of what they expect going forward, what I'd say is if we're talking about 2015 commodity prices, our guidance would stay at an effective tax rate of between 35% to 40%, now if we're in a lower commodity price environment like we saw in the first quarter, we're probably looking at something less than 30%.", "Phil Gresh", "Second question is just may be a follow up on the balance sheet, looking at it slightly differently your absolute debt levels are now around $43 billion and just kind of wondering how you feel about that comfort-wise, as you look through the cycle, and in a better environment with more cash flow, is that pay down on an absolute basis in any way a priority or would you be thinking about other uses of cash?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Well, I mean we'll -- obviously one of the considerations when we think about our capital allocation is retirement of debt, so we'll keep mindful but remember we've got a very strong balance sheet, we'll look at the relative decisions around investments in the business, the pace of investments, our commitment to our reliable and growing dividend and then appropriately consideration on long term debt levels. It's all about maintaining prudent cash management, maintaining our financial flexibility, we will continue to be disciplined in our investment approach, we are not going to forego attractive opportunities. But we will continue to assess our cash and our funding options around a range of options and take a very balanced approach on how we go forward in our capital deployment.", "Phil Gresh", "If I were to just clarify, would that pay down be a priority over buybacks?", "Jeff Woodbury", "That\u2019s a decision that would be taken by the Board that will be a function of a lot of factors Phil I wouldn\u2019t leave you with any impression that there is any prioritization that I am conveying.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays.", "Paul Cheng", "Jeff I have two questions the first one may be a little bit more detailed and earlier just let me know. If we're looking at the economics, have you talked to your downstream people that whether right now economic to bring Naphtha into the U.S. gasoline pool or that you're better off to ship Naphtha into your cracker for the petrochemical in Europe or Asia?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Paul, you are asking what about bringing Naphtha?", "Paul Cheng", "From U.S.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Importing it into the U.S.?", "Paul Cheng", "No, no, exporting from -- either because I mean in order to show or in order we still have Naphtha in this country so the question that I have is that have you discussed it with your refining and chemical colleagues whether it's more economic for them to take the new Naphtha and bring it into the -- into the gasoline pool in the U.S. or that export it into the overseas such as in European or in your Asia petrochemical guy to use it at the pit stop there?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes, we maintain tremendous flexibility on our feedstock options and that\u2019s a real time optimization that we are managing and we will optimize those feeds based on the best available returns. That\u2019s including moving feeds between continents.", "Paul Cheng", "Yes, but just curious that I mean do you have any prior insight that you can share at this point that, how is the economics that have shift, is it more in favor of branding it into the gasoline pool in this country or that is exporting?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes, Paul I really don\u2019t have anything else to share on it other than to say that it's a dynamic issue that we continue to optimize, and I would say that we are very well positioned to ensure that we are making the best value towards it with respect to our feedstock swing.", "Paul Cheng", "The second question is that, for the Point Thompson you had mentioned in your prepared remark that it is also gives you a platform or a demonstration for potentially in the future Alaska LNG project. Let's assume that if the Alaska LNG project won't go ahead and would be not economic at all, is the Point Thompson is still a good investment in here by itself with all that purpose?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes, I would tell Paul that we look at these decisions on a long term and given the constructive view what we think gas is going to do the overtime, we are confident that the Alaska gas will be commercialized as to how that actually happens, may vary from what we are currently considering. But we have been very active with our partners in the state to identify the highest value opportunity in order to commercialize that gas, and it's going to compete on a global perspective. What's going to be really critical is getting transparent predictable and stable fiscal structure in place in order to make sure that it underpins such a significant investment.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Blake Hernandez from Howard Weil.", "Blake Hernandez", "I was hoping you could share a little bit about the rationale of the dividend increase, I know during your Analyst Day you kind a provided a cash flow breakeven, potentially in 2017, it sounded like then your remarks today you hit it kind of a alluded to some capital efficiency and maybe potential for capital to be moving down. So I didn\u2019t know if it would be fair to think that that cash breakeven number has potentially moved down and maybe if that played into your thoughts around the dividend increase?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes, I think your are referring to the cash flow neutrality slide that we shared with you during the Analyst presentation and if you recall, it's just a -- it's a perspective of how we are managing our cash and how we manage the business. And the organization is always trying to reduce that cost structure and improve the ultimate margins. And you are correct, I mean we had a -- we feel fairly confident that we can achieve cash flow neutrality into the future I mean what we shared with you during the Analyst Meeting was a very wide range on prices but one that\u2019s reasonable with the low end being $40 flat real and you can see that we have good potential to reach that cash flow neutrality particularly in 2017 and forward. As I said earlier, we continue to reduce our cash expenditures and making good gains but I would tell you that when we make the decisions around capital allocation it's a consideration of a lot of factors we are going to balance our long-term investment with our shareholder distributions nothing has changed but I will tell you that we remain very committed to that reliable and growing dividend.", "Blake Hernandez", "Okay, great. The second one is just kind of project specific I know you mentioned Kashagan coming online later this year. I think there have been some press reports suggesting that could get pushed out to \u201917. Can you remind me I believe Exxon was ready to takeover operatorship, are you formally controlling the new flow on that or you relying on peers at this point?", "Jeff Woodbury", "No. The Kashagan is managed by the North Caspian operating company. And which you may recall hearing is that, that was restructured in a more conventional manner and Exxon Mobil secunded the Director for NCOC. In terms of timing what we're doing there is we're replacing the onshore or offshore gas nova pipelines where NCOC is and they are making good progress they are progressing as per plan with intention they have to complete that by the end of this year and start up the facility.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Asit Sen from CLSA Americas.", "Asit Sen ", "So two upstream questions one on Upper Zakum and one on West Africa, on Upper Zakum in Abu Dhabi, Jeff there were talks to expand capacity to over 1 million barrels a day, could you update us on the current thought process on expansion and where production is currently? And secondly on in West Africa Exxon had decent success last year in starting up the new projects Kizomba in Angola and Erha in Nigeria, how would you characterize the current operating environment in some of the key countries given all the reported fiscal stress I know it's probably a generic comment but any color would be helpful?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Okay, Asit. On Upper Zakum current production is around 650,000 barrels a day. It's the project itself is progressing well to increase capacity ultimately to 750,000 a day we are continuing to evaluate the opportunity expand to a 1 million a day development so really nothing more to share on that and what is that?", "Asit Sen", "And Jeff on the timeframe for 750 is what timeframe?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Getting up to that full 750?", "Asit Sen", "Yes.", "Jeff Woodbury", "I don\u2019t recall by probably around by 2018.", "Asit Sen", "Okay.", "Jeff Woodbury", "On West Africa let\u2019s just say we've made some really good progress but just a broad comment about globally there with country budgets feeling the strain of lower energy prices it is slowing down investment globally and that is a challenge to make sure that we progress those investments at a pace that is consistent with the resource owner. I'll say that we have a very strong inventory of opportunities in West Africa but we've got to do with consistent with confidence in the fiscal basis in which we are making those investments.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.", "Roger Read", "I guess if we could talk maybe a little bit about cost deflation kind of where are you progressing both on the CapEx and the OpEx side and whether kind of consistent with one of the questions asked earlier if there was any seasonal component to that, that we should be thinking about?", "Jeff Woodbury", "So just a recap for the results that we had last year we were able to reduce our total CapEx and cash OpEx by about $16 billion year-on-year representing about a 16% decrease. In terms of going forward into 2016 nothing has really changed we continue to manage the cost side as we always have focusing on structural efficiencies market savings while maintaining operational integrity. I will tell you Roger we still believe there is significant opportunity in streamlining the business and reducing the cost structure and I would say it's while it's early in the year we\u2019re seeing a similar trend line as to last year but we will maintain that relentless focus on cost regardless of whether we are in a low price environment or in a high price environment just to give you a bit of a perspective again being very early in the year our upstream unit costs for OpEx are down about 9%.", "Roger Read", "And along those same lines at this point oil prices are rebounded, the market is starting to think about an ultimate recovery in drilling activity, do you take advantage, consistent with your view on there is lot more cost to get out, is this a point at which you'd want to sign contracts, kind of lock in service capacity, service pricing, kind of anywhere around the world really?", "Jeff Woodbury", "I'd say Roger that, in the downturn we've been high grading our service providers and we've been locking in more favorable, more efficient service contracts, so it's not something that we had stopped doing, I mean, one of the advantages of Exxon Mobil is that we're able to invest through the cycle, that means that in a down cycle, we're continuing to spend a significant amount of money to capture value opportunities associated with that down cycle. So, of course the organization and you have heard me talk previously Roger about the global procurement business but it\u2019s all focused around finding the lowest life cycle cost and you are correct to say that in a low price environment, there are some unique opportunities that we want to walk in to.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.", "Neil Mehta", "So, clearly $48 Brent is not a great price but a heck of a lot better than $30 a barrel Brent and so, it feels like this market is moving in the right direction, demand is growing and we're seeing signs on OPEC supplies coming offline. I just want to reconcile that with your view, or does Exxon believe that we're starting to see the signs of a sustained recovery in energy prices particularly in crude and then because you get to see the world through your portfolio, one of the big debates is a non OPEC supply outside the U.S. really rolling over because of the decline rates, are you seeing evidence that that supply outside the U.S. is actually falling off?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes, the first thing I'd say, Neil, and it's really a good guard around how the macro is looking and how the sector will respond to it, I'd say first and foremost is that remember, we are price takers, we are not counting on price growth, what we are focused on is really maintaining a focus on the things that we control in order to create margin, so regardless of what it is going to do, it is going to do it, and we'll go to keep focused on the things that we control. Second thing I would say in just a little bit more expansion of what I was sharing with Doug earlier is that underlying demand growth has been generally strong and we expect this year would be in excess of the 10 year average and I would say that in the first half of 2016, we're still oversupplied by about 1.5 million barrels per day. We do expect to see conversions in the second half with seasonal demand growth but that's going to widen again in the first half of 2017 and remember during this period of oversupply, we've been building up commercial inventories, since about year in 2013, so taking forward, we're seeing conversions over supply and demand into the future but we have got this overhead of supply that's going to also have to work off overtime. So, we're heading in the right direction in terms of how and when that will happen will be anybody's guess, remember there is still a bit of uncertainty in terms of the supply trend and the economic growth near-term but clearly we're seeing as you are all aware we're seeing North America supply dropping off pretty significantly now.", "Neil Mehta", "I appreciate that Jeff and then I have two questions, related questions here, first is, any update on Torrance and then second what's the latest on Groningen?", "Jeff Woodbury", "So on Torrance, we have completed the repairs of the electrostatic precipitator and that we have received the approval from the regulator to go ahead and start operations. So, there is a number of things that we need to do, to get it up and capacity demonstrated, but we do expect the formal change of control to happen mid 2016.", "Neil Mehta", "And Groningen?", "Jeff Woodbury", "On Groningen, as you know, we continue to have a pretty significant impact on volumes in the quarter, it was close to 600 million cubic feet a day, we have made our NAM has made the submission for the new production forecast going forward and my understanding is, is that the regulator will review that by September of this year, right now the cap is 27 billion cubic meters but it has the potential to grow up, depending on what demand requirements are.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research.", "Paul Sankey", "I was looking back at the interview that Rex Tillerson gave after the Analyst Meeting when he was asked about the AAA rating, and what he said quite specifically is that there has been periods where Exxon's financial metrics have been worse than they are today but you still retained a triple A rating, and obviously as you mentioned in your remarks, you have been downgraded by S&P. Naturally I went to S&P and what I saw there was the comment that maintaining production and replacing reserves will require higher spending from Exxon. So it seems that given the financial metrics are not the issues that it seems there's an upstream issue that S&P is concerned about. Can you talk about your ability to maintain production and reserves at the current level of spending and address whether or not they're correct in thinking that you are going to have to spend a lot more to maintain reserves in production? Thanks.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Sure Paul. Well, first, I\u2019ll remind everybody that we got a very large inventory of investment opportunities over 90 billion barrels of resourcing our portfolio and if you recall in the analyst presentation, we provide a little bit more inside as to the type of projects and their potential capacity they can bring on over the time horizon. And of course what we need to do is we need to make sure that as we mature that inventory of projects that we are doing it with the greatest value proposition and I think we have made a great strive in finding opportunities in order to reduce the cost structure going forward. I would say though Paul that we went to these cycles for a long time, we have been able to maintain a very strong balance sheet, we have maintained our financial flexibility to the ups and downs. And our inventory looks very attractive going forward. So we think all the elements are set right to continue to invest into an attractive way to maintain our initiative leading return on capital employed. The other point I\u2019ll remind is that as we showed in the analyst presentation we have done very well in terms of efficiency deploying investment dollars. If you recall the upstream capital efficiency chart that we used in an analyst presentation chart, our capital employed over prove reserves, clearly we are distinguishing ourselves relative with others.", "Paul Sankey", "Okay Jeff because of time constraint, you again, mentioned return on capital employed. I really struggle with you losing money in the upstream on an earnings basis, particularly in the U.S., and how you reconcile that with the measure of the return of capital employed. Typically we don't look at that we look at the cash flow measure. Can you help us with the DD&A upstream particularly in the U.S. so we can get to the cash returns that you're making as opposed to? Thank you.", "Jeff Woodbury", "We have got a very strong portfolio in the upstream and remember that, we invest on it with a long term view that\u2019s informed to buy our long term energy demand outlook. All of our assets were managed to maximize the returns to the lifecycle with the objective we are maintaining, positive cash flow in low price environments. We will continue to focus on those things that we control cost reliability, operational integrity. Importantly, we will invest in attractive opportunities throughout the cycle that further enhance the asset profitability. And we see significant value in our assets. So yes, there is a low price, we are in a low price period like we have been in the past as I have said, we really design these assets to be very durable during a low price environment, it continue to generate. Our producing assets continue to generate cash flow and over the long term, we will continue to demonstrate industry leading returns on capital employed.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Anish Kapadia from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.", "Anish Kapadia", "And I just had a question on your project execution. I think Exxon has clearly shown leadership amongst your peers on project execution over the last few years, but Exxon doesn't seem to have sanctioned any major upstream projects of note. The last couple of years, and do we see anything on the horizon to be sanctioned for this year, so I'm just wondering how do you intend to benefit from the quality of your project execution if you're not progressing with projects of the moment.", "Jeff Woodbury", "I\u2019ll tell you that we will announce our FIDs after the company has made that funding decisions. So we really don\u2019t project it. But as in indicated just a moment ago, we gave you an insight through our analyst presentation and the F and O as to the type of projects that we are currently working and we really taking this down cycle as an opportunity to retest the value proposition for each one of these investment opportunities and there are some incremental benefits that we are able to capture through anywhere from design changes to different ways to execute the project given the service market to fiscal basis. So this is a good opportunity to step back and make sure that we are really capturing the most value from these investments. So we gave you some line of insight on the upstream and I\u2019ll just remind you that we have got 10 major projects still underway in the upstream that will startup between 2016 and 2017. As well as we maintain a very active high value work program and we gave you some insight on that during analyst presentation as well with a very deep inventory of opportunities. So, in summary I would tell you a large inventory of investment opportunities that are in various stages of planning execution when we get to the point where we've made a investment decision we will share that publicly but the pace would be consistent upon project maturity to maximize value and our prudent financial management, and now of course remember Anish that we've got a lot of a number of very large investments underway in our Downstream and Chemical business.", "Anish Kapadia", "And just one follow-up more specifically on Nigeria because you've got a number of projects that have been in your project queue for a number of years, the South Oil field projects that you gave also Oxy field and I see you've added yet another project Aurora West into that project queue. Just wondering what -- what has kind of prevented you from sanctioning some of those projects it is has been around for a long time, and what needs to change in Nigeria for you to be able to go ahead with projects?", "Jeff Woodbury", "I would tell you that some of these projects are a function of optimizing the design all away through to getting alignment with partners and establishing the right fiscal basis to go ahead and make the investment.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Edward Westlake from Credit Suisse.", "Edward Westlake", "Just on gas, we've got oversupplied markets in the U.S. and Europe and in Asia. Now clearly the best cure for gas prices being low is low gas prices demand will probably pick up as a result of the time. Can you give us some sense of the magnitude of potential gas declines across the portfolio you exercise capital over the next four or five years?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes you are talking with respect to our portfolio Ed?", "Edward Westlake", "I'm really thinking about base business. I mean obviously we know that you've got some new projects coming on stream operated by others like Gorgon etcetera?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes and you've seen in our volumes your gas volumes have dropped off impart and largely in the U.S. but impart that is due to a switch up from gas growing to higher value liquids drilling during this down cycle. Gas Ed we continue to be very constructive grown about 1.6% per year primarily driven by the power sector. The LNG we expect to triple from current capacity between now and 2040. So, I think we've got the long-term value preposition well within our site and it's just pacing those investments consistent with that demand growth to make sure that we capture full value for it but we've got a very deep inventory of gas and if you look at our improved reserves it's somewhere around 45% to 48% of our total improved reserves comparable part on our resource base and then of course importantly it add significant value to the value chain it provides an advantage feedstock for us for our steam cracking here in North America. You may recall that we are in the progress of progressing the expansion over a bay count for adding another 1.5 million tonnes per annum of cracking capacity and in conjunction with that adding polyethylene lines over at Mont Belvieu. So it's got a significant component of our future very deep inventory pace would be a function of demand.", "Edward Westlake", "Maybe a specific on Asia gas you went I think from 4.1 down to 3.8 in the quarter. You mentioned PSE impacts in gas, maybe just run through what's happening there. Is it sort of customers are exercising low GTQs on the LNG contracts or is there something else going on?", "Jeff Woodbury", "There were three major drivers there. One was planned maintenance, second one being asset managements and divestments investments and the third one being a price impacts.", "Edward Westlake", "So you're not seeing customers exercise low quantity crude oil ounces?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Well, I can't really talk about specific contracts but it's primarily driven by the three items I shared with you.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Iain Reid from Macquarie. ", "Iain Reid", "Couple of questions for you, you talked about the North American U.S. low 48 liquid productions falling, but ExxonMobil's price isn't fall. It's going up. Is this a kind of deliberate decision to invest counter cyclically? You talked about your long-term vision etcetera or is it something specific to your acreage where, you're getting more barrels out of your existing wells, because, you're contributing to the problem rather than the solution, if you're growing your low 48 volumes? And I have got a follow-up after that.", "Jeff Woodbury", "I tell you Ian that as I said earlier that we're able to continue to invest in the down cycle, and that provides an opportunity for us to capture lower cost structure in the investments that we're making. So particularly in the lower 48 unconventionals, it's allowed us to hydrate the rig activity we're down quite significantly in terms of now we're down to about 16. We have reduced our activity materially. So continue to pursue the attractive unconventional opportunities that we have predominantly in the Permian Bakken, and we're getting great value for it, so it just shows the value proposition that ExxonMobil is able to provide because we have the capability to invest through the cycle.", "Iain Reid", "Okay. And my follow-up question is on chemicals. Obviously very strong numbers in this quarter, the environment is obviously pretty favorable out there in terms of natural gas prices and the fact there's a lot of maintenance activities out there so lower production but looking a little bit further forward. There is more volumes coming on stream, your building capacity as well. Do you see this kind of chemical cycle at the peak now and then going into a bit of a trough toward the second half of this year and into next year or does Exxon have a kind of -- a more kind of positive view of the market.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Currently, olefin and polyolefin have been pretty tight and demand is continuing to grow and it's outpacing capacity additions and I think that's an important investment opportunity, remember this is all our investment decisions Ian are really founded on our view of long-term demand and on the chemical side, as I mentioned earlier, we expect demand to grow about 1.5% above GDP. Now, I'll tell you that underlying demand growth across the olefin and polyolefin, the aromatics our specialties has been fairly robust, now sometimes the supply capacity additions are outpacing that and that's what you're seeing for instance in paraxylene but broadly speaking the demand is robust and it's going to continue to grow and we think it presents some investment opportunities.", "Iain Reid", "Even with the growth in ethylene supply that we're looking at in the U.S. over the next year or so?", "Jeff Woodbury", "That's correct.", "Operator", "And we have time for one last question and that will come from John Herrlin from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.", "John Herrlin", "Just a quick one for me Jeff, on Guyana, you have multiple structures in your lease area, in the event that you have multiple successes should we consider Guyana to be kind of an analog to what you did in Kizomba while back in terms of design one build many and then my other question is can you bring some of these longer cycle projects forward to take advantage of excess E&C capacities that I mean you did, discuss kind of how you're optimizing things but can you bring a longer cycle projects forward to take advantage of low cost environment?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes. On Guyana, John, and good morning, John, I'd tell you that as I indicated earlier, it is really early days and we need to get a better handle of the full block potential but kind of the question around design one build many, I mean, we're doing that cross all of our businesses and I'd tell you that real modifier in that is design one put continue to get more and more efficient in that design and reduce the cost structure. So I'd tell you the even expanded globally in terms of how you look at concurrent developments in different parts of the world to make sure that you're fully capturing the benefits of robust design and execution, to your point around the engineering and construction contractors, yes, I mean, their backlogs are certainly light and we are very mindful about facing the investments to make sure that we maximize value but we want to do with a clear view on prudent financial management and maintaining our financial flexibility going forward but I'd tell you that one of the best opportunities that we have out there is the collaboration that we've been able to have with many of our providers and really encouraging them to bring forward lower cost solutions to see if we can make investments move quicker.", "Operator", "And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Woodbury at this time, I'll turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. ", "Jeff Woodbury", "Well, thank you. To conclude, I just want to thank you all again for your time and very good questions. It was a insightful discussion, I think for all of us. So, we appreciate your time this morning and we very much appreciate your interest in Exxon Mobil and we look forward to talking with you in the future.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. And at this time I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning, and welcome to Exxon Mobil\u2019s fourth quarter earnings call and webcast. The focus of this call is Exxon Mobil\u2019s financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2013. I will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website.", "Before we go further I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on slide two.", "Moving to slide three, we provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global economic growth continued at a modest pace in the fourth quarter, with mixed performance across the region. Moderate U.S. economic growth was sustained. China\u2019s growth rate stabilized which Europe\u2019s economic recovery remained sluggish. Energy markets delivered mixed results. WTI prices decreased more than more than $8 per barrel widening the discount to Brent as the global marker was only slightly lower in the quarter.", "Henry Hub natural gas prices were essentially flat. Global industry refining margins strengthened as stronger U.S. margins were partially offset by continued market weakness in Europe and Asia Pacific. Chemical commodity product margins also declined over the quarter.", "Turning now to the fourth quarter financial results as shown on slide four, ExxonMobil\u2019s fourth quarter earnings were just under $8.4 billion or $1.91 per share. The corporation distributed $5.8 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total $3 billion was used to purchase shares.", "CapEx was $9.9 billion in the fourth quarter. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $12 billion. At the end of the quarter cash totaled $4.9 billion and debt was $22.7 billion.", "The next slide provides additional detail on fourth quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter cash decreased from $5.7 billion to $4.9 billion. Earnings, depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program yielded $12 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included additions to property, plant and equipment of $8.4 billion and shareholder distributions of $5.8 million. Additional financing and investing activities increased cash by $1.4 billion. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $3 billion in the first quarter of 2014.", "Moving on to slide six and a review of our segmented results ExxonMobil\u2019s fourth quarter earnings of just under $8.4 billion decreased by $1.6 billion from the fourth quarter of 2012. Lower earnings across all business segments were partially offset by reduced corporate and financing expenses.", "In the sequential quarter comparison shown on slide seven earnings increase by $480 million as higher upstream and downstream earnings and lower corporate and financing expenses were partially offset by lower chemical earning. Guidance for corporate and financing expenses remains at $500 million to $700 million per quarter.", "Turning now to the upstream financial and operating results and starting on slide eight, upstream earnings in the fourth quarter were $6.8 billion, down $976 million from the fourth quarter of 2012. Realizations increased earnings by $60 million as worldwide natural gas realizations increased by $0.41 per 1,000 cubic feet and crude oil decreased by $2.38 per barrel. Unfavorable volume and mix effects including the impact of crude under lifts of West Africa and the North Sea along with lower natural gas production decreased earnings by $550 million.", "All other items decreased earnings by $490 million reflecting increased expenses driven by Kearl operating costs and higher planned exploration costs in Russia. Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel for the fourth quarter were $17.95 excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes.", "Moving now to slide nine production decreased by 77,000 oil equivalent barrels per day or 1.8% from the fourth quarter of last year. Liquids production was up 32,000 barrels per day or 1.5%. Ramp up at the Kearl and Nigeria Satellite projects lowered downtime and continued increased production from unconventional plays in the U.S. were partly offset by field decline and price and spend impacts. Natural gas production was down 654 million cubic feet per day primarily due to expected lower U.S. production and field decline in several areas.", "Turning now to the sequential comparison and starting on slide 10. Upstream earnings increased by $73 million versus the third quarter. Realizations decreased earnings by $430 million as worldwide crude prices decreased by $5.89 per barrel and natural gas realizations increased by $0.57 per thousand cubic feet. Volume and mix effects improved earnings by $90 million, reflecting increased global liquids and natural gas production. All other items had a positive impact of $410 million. Higher gains from asset sales were partially offset by higher operating expenses.", "Moving to slide 11, oil equivalent volumes were up 190,000 barrels per day or 4.9% sequentially. Liquids production increased 36,000 barrels per day, mainly due to additional production from work programs in the U.S. and the North Sea, Kearl ramp-up and lower downtime, partly offset by scheduled maintenance in Nigeria and field decline. Natural gas production was up 973 million cubic feet per day mainly due to seasonal demand in Europe.", "Moving now to the downstream financial and operating results and starting on slide 12. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $916 million, down $852 million from the fourth quarter of 2012 mainly due to lower non-U.S. refining margins. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $110 million driven by refining optimization activities. All other items including higher operating expenses and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts decreased earnings by $280 million.", "Turning to slide 13, sequentially fourth quarter downstream earnings increased by $324 million. Improved refining margins, mainly in North America increased earnings by $120 million. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $330 million reflecting favorable refining optimization activity. Other items reduced earnings by a net $120 million.", "Moving now to the chemical financial and operating results and starting on slide 14. Fourth quarter chemical earnings were $910 million, down $48 million versus the prior year quarter due to lower specialty product margins. Positive volume and mix effects were mostly offset by other items. Moving to slide 15, sequentially chemical earnings decreased by $115 million, primarily due to lower margins in Europe.", "Moving next to the fourth quarter business highlights and beginning on slide 16. We continue to advance our global portfolio of high quality upstream projects. Construction at the PNG LNG project is now nearing completion. With the focus shifting to commissioning key facilities and equipment in preparation for first LNG delivery now targeted for the third quarter of this year. Gas has been introduced to both the gas conditioning plants at Hides and the LNG facility in order to progress commissioning activities.", "The Kearl expansion project is on budget, is now more than 70% complete and remains on target for 2015 startup. We continue to develop attractive logistic solutions to provide market access for our growing oil sands production from this future additional capacity.", "At Upper Zakum we are progressing with our partners the field redevelopment to raise production capacity to 750,000 barrels a day over the coming years. The increase is enabled through the use of four artificial islands of which two are now complete and the extended reach drilling using proprietary Exxon Mobil technology. Similar works and facility additions will continue through 2015. In 2013 the Upper Zakum joint venture was granted a 15 year license extension through 2041. The extension includes enhanced fiscal terms allowing the expansion project to meet our investment criteria and contribute towards Abu Dhabi\u2019s plans to boost production.", "In Iraq we reached a production capacity of 500,000 barrels per day at the West Qurna 1 development in 2013. We continue to progress additional capacity expansion through facility debottlenecking, workovers, new drilled wells and well tie-ins. We have also completed 3-D seismic acquisition over the West Qurna 1 field.", "In the fourth quarter we executed agreements to sell a combined 35% interest to PetroChina and Pertamina reducing our participation interest from 60% to 25%. We will remain as the lead operator for the project and are committed to maximize value for all parties involved in redeveloping this world class resource.", "Turning now to slide 17 for an update on our exploration activities. In Tanzania, the Mronge 1 well discovered an additional two to three TCF of natural gas in place from two separate intervals. The main accumulation is at the same stratographic level is the proven Zafrani 1 well. The secondary accumulation was encountered in a separate gas bearing reservoir in a play previously untested in Block 2. Mronge 1 is the fifth discovery on Block 2 and brings the total of the gas in place up to 17 to 20 TCF. Further exploration drilling is planned for 2014.", "In Russia, Exxon Mobil and Rosneft completed joint venture agreements to implement a pilot project for tight oil development in Western Siberia. Operations for the pilot program are under way. We are evaluating data from the 2013 activity which included a mix of workovers and new well drilling. The year 2014 we will focus on drilling and testing new horizontal wells with operations to commence by the third quarter. We are currently finalizing locations to test this high potential resource.", "In Argentina we drilled our first operated well and are currently drilling the second operated well in Vaca Muerta shale formation. Previously, we have drilled a total of six Vaca Muerta wells with our co-venturers to progress the evaluation of approximately 900,000 net acres. We have ongoing well operations to gather their production testing data required to validate expected recovery and to support potential development planning.", "Turning now to slide 18 and an update on our downstream investments, which continue to strengthen our global portfolio. During the quarter we achieved several investment milestones. We commissioned a new diesel hydrotreater at our Singapore refinery increasing ultra-low diesel production capacity by 62,000 barrels per day. The new unit along with the recently completed petrochemical expansion project at our Singapore complex positions Exxon Mobil to competitively deliver high value products to the growing Asia Pacific region. We continue to extend our operating cost advantage by improving energy efficiency at our facilities.", "Worldwide cash operating costs for our portfolio of refineries are well below the industry average and consistently outperform the competition. In November, we commissioned our latest cogeneration facility at our Augusta Refinery in Italy, increasing energy efficiency by 6%.", "To support market access for our growing Canadian oil sands production we announced plans to build a crude oil railroad loading facility next to the Strathcona refinery in Edmonton. The terminal will have a capacity of up to 250,000 barrels per day, of which we plan to use a 100,000 barrels per day to supply our refining network. Connections to both Canadian National and Canadian Pacific mainlines will enable efficient, cost effective transportation of heavy crude. Construction is underway and startup is expected in early 2015.", "Now I would like to provide a summary of our full year results shown on slide 19. 2013 earnings were $32.6 billion or $7.37 per share. The corporation distributed $25.9 billion to shareholders in 2013 through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $15 billion was utilized to purchase shares. CapEx in 2013 was $42.5 billion and includes $4.3 billion for acquisitions. Base full year CapEx of $38.2 billion was in line with our spending plans. Cash flows from operations and asset sales remains robust at $47.6 billion, which included $2.7 billion from asset sales.", "Moving now to the full year cash flow statement as shown on slide 20. During the year cash decreased from $9.9 billion to $4.9 billion. The combined impact of earnings, depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program yielded $47.6 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included additions to property, plant and equipment of $33.7 billion and shareholder distributions of $25.9 billion. Additional financing and investing activities increased cash by $7 billion.", "Moving on to slide 21 and a review of our fiscal year segmented results. 2013 earnings decreased by $12.3 billion. Lower net gains from divestments account for 70% or $8.6 billion of the reduced earnings. Lower earnings across all business segments were partially offset by reduced corporate and financing expenses.", "Turning now to the full year comparison of upstream results and starting on slide 22. Upstream earnings were $26.8 billion, down $3.1 billion for 2012. Improved natural gas realizations partially offset by lower crude oil realizations increased earnings by $390 million. Unfavorable volume and mix effects including the impact of crude under-lifts in West Africa and lower natural gas production decreased earnings by $910 million. All other items including lower gains from asset sales, higher expenses driven by Kearl start-up and operating cost and higher planned exploration cost in Russia reduced earnings by $2.5 billion. Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel for the year were $18.03 excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes.", "Moving to slide 23, volumes decreased by 1.5% or 64,000 oil equivalent barrels per day compared to 2012. Excluding the impacts of lower entitlement volumes, quotas and divestments production was essentially flat. Liquids production was up 17,000 barrels per day. Ramp-up at the Kearl and Nigeria projects, lower downtime and increased U.S production were partly offset by fuel decline and divestment impacts. Natural gas production was down 486 million cubic feet per day. As expected lower U.S. production, field decline in several areas and full year AKG entitlement impacts in Qatar were partly offset by increased weather related demand in Europe and project ramp-ups.", "On slide 24, we show actual 2013 production volumes compared to the outlook we provided at the Analyst meeting last March. Overall total production volumes were in-line with our target of 4.2 million oil equivalent barrels per day, with liquids production slightly below target and gas production slightly higher. Several positive factors contributed to this result, including strong uptime performance, increased North America unconventional liquids production and higher European gas demand for the year.", "These factors mostly offset the lower than expected volume contribution from Kearl and the loss of Kashagan volumes due to the pipeline issue currently being investigated. During the fourth quarter we continue to ramp up Kearl production, including making several upgrades to the steam system and filtration units to improve overall reliability. Average Kearl production for the fourth quarter and full year was 47,000 and 21,000 barrels per day respectively and production rates of 100,000 barrels per day were reached by the end of the year.", "Full year comparison for the downstream is shown on slide 25. 2013 earnings were $3.4 billion, down $9.7 billion from 2012. Lower refining margins across all regions reduced earnings by $2.9 billion. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $310 million as higher planned maintenance activities in the U.S. and Europe was partly offset by refining optimization activities. Other items, including the absence of gains from the Japan restructuring and other divestments reduced earnings a total of $6.6 billion.", "On slide 26 we show the full year comparison for chemical results. 2013 earnings were $3.8 billion. Higher commodity margins, partly offset by lower specialty margins increased earnings by $480 million. Volume and mix effects also increased earnings by $80 million, mainly due to strong U.S. commodity demand. Other effects reduced earnings by $630 million, mainly due to the absence of gains from the Japan restructuring.", "Moving to slide 27, in conclusion in 2013 we earned $32.6 billion, generated $47.6 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales, invested $42.5 billion in the business and distributed $25.9 billion to our shareholders. ExxonMobil\u2019s strong financial and operating performance reflects the benefit of our integrated business model and other sustainable competitive advantages that create long-term shareholder value.", "We achieved total production in line with our target and continue to progress attractive opportunities across our unique and balanced portfolio. Base full year CapEx spending was also in-line with our plans. Our cash flow remains strong and enables robust shareholder distributions.", "Finally I would like to mention two upcoming events. First in mid-February we will be releasing our 2013 reserves replacement data. Second, as many of you will already have seen our upcoming analyst meeting will take place at the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday March 5th. We will include a live webcast beginning at 9 AM Eastern, 8 AM Central Time. Presentation will be led by Exxon Mobil\u2019s Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson.", "That concludes my prepared remarks. I would now be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you Mr. Rosenthal. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Doug Terreson with ISI Group.", "Douglas Terreson \u2013 ISI Group Inc.", "Good morning David.", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning how are you?", "Douglas Terreson \u2013 ISI Group Inc.", "I am doing fine. My question is about European E&P and specifically whether or not we could get clarification on the supply restriction at Groningen meaning it seems like 20% reduction in output is going to be required from the partners during the next three years which I think equates to about 60,000 BOE per day of heavy duty net Exxon Mobil. So is it the correct way to think about the supply effect and the duration of the restriction and just any color on that situation will be appreciated.", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah Doug I\u2019ll be happy to give you a little perspective on the Groningen situation. Let me start by saying that the government\u2019s draft decision does include a production decrease for the next three years of about 7% compared to average production over the average of the last few years. If this indicated \u2013 this off take limit is final it would have an impact of approximately, on ExxonMobil 100 MCF a day net production in 2014 versus the average of the last several years.", "Now compared to 2013 which as I mentioned was a year of very high production due to weather-related demand, there would be a decrease of about 20% and that\u2019s consistent with what was communicated by the Dutch government. The proposed curtailment is not final, it will take a little bit of time to finalize it. But if implemented again the impact on us relative to a normal year is about 100 MCF a day.", "Douglas Terreson \u2013 ISI Group Inc.", "Okay. Sorry go ahead.", "David Rosenthal", "I am sorry. Let me just make one of the comment to keep it in perspective and add a little color, in terms of the financial impact on the company while Groningen is of course very attractive asset in our upstream, the unit profitability is in the bottom half of our portfolio. And so the earnings impact is not as great as I think some people might have expected.", "Douglas Terreson \u2013 ISI Group Inc.", "Okay, good point. And then just second in U.S. downstream, obviously you guys have a several leading position in the mid-continent naturally benefited from wide differential to the last couple of years. But wondered if we could get an update on the program to secure advantage [inaudible] or what have you for the refineries outside of mid-conn. So any elaboration on this is appreciated. I think you guys talked about a little bit on the Gulf Coast, at the analysts meetings, so just an update there would be appreciated.", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah, sure, in general if you look at our mid-conn footprint which as we talked about before is one of the largest in the industry. And our Gulf Coast refining footprint is also one of the largest. So we got a lot going on in terms of making sure that we can get the Western Canadian crudes down into the circuit and also take advantage of the light sweet crude. And we are, pipelines, rail, barge, we are using all of the logistics opportunities available to us to optimize those barrels getting to refineries, and that\u2019s a big piece of what you see in these positive, volume mix effects on our earnings both quarter-to-quarter, sequentially and that sort of thing.", "Particularly if you look at that sequential comparison where we\u2019ve really been able to optimize the sea slate we\u2019re running and of course, take advantage of butane pricing as we switch over to winter grade fuels, and so that\u2019s been helpful to us as well. But we are actively progressing that and the fourth quarter was a good one for us. And I might just mention one other thing that makes that important in the earnings comparison, we did have in the fourth quarter alone about $ 250 million of negative price timing effects. So that hurt on the margin side, gets somewhat offset by some of these refining optimization efforts that we talked about.", "So we continue to work on that. One of the things that helps is being fully integrated across the downstream and upstream and chemical and having a worldwide supply department to help us on this. But you can rest assured from Canada all the way down to the Gulf Coast we are fully optimizing and taking advantage of our integration opportunities.", "Douglas Terreson \u2013 ISI Group Inc.", "Great thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Hey, good morning, David.", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning, Evan.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Yeah, first question on the production lines, I guess, from your comments I can disaggregate the impact from Kearl and Kashagan in the 4th quarter. Can you provide any outlook into 2014 on Kearl, what\u2019s the ramp and more color there? And on Kashagan which you mentioned is there any prognosis for the production return, the state of the gas leak repairs and I have a follow-up, thanks.", "David Rosenthal", "Sure, let me start with Kearl. I can\u2019t give you an exact time when we would expect to reach our full production capabilities. I will say although the Kearl volumes did come in over the course of years, I mentioned less than our expectation going in, and certainly part of the volume outlook we shared with you last March, we did achieve a number of milestones in cranking that project up. We have been able to run each of the three froth treatment trains at their maximum capacity on a combined basis. We\u2019ve been able to reach rates at a 100,000 barrels per day.", "What we are working on now is how do we improve the reliability so that we can run at those rates on a consistent basis. So we continue to make progress there. And again as I think I have mentioned in prior calls the good news for us is all the technology is working, the trains work, the equipment works. It\u2019s simply then just a matter of start-up and this complex kit we got on the ground and working some of these reliability issues that I mentioned. But they are all fixable. We\u2019re working on it. We are making progress. But I wouldn\u2019t want to give you an exact date in terms of full capacity but we\u2019ll give you an update at the Analyst meeting in March and probably be in a better position to help you with some outlook on that.", "With regard to Kashagan n, as you know oil and gas production does remain shut in. We are investigating. We\u2019ve got the best experts in the world looking at this. We\u2019re investigating the root cause of the pipeline leaks and the seeps. That\u2019s going to take a little more time. We do know that the immediate cause of the leaks has been sulphide stress cracking but we\u2019re still investigating to establish what\u2019s the cause of the sulphide stress cracking. And that is ongoing. There\u2019s a lot of work going on, a lot of analysis underway, but I just couldn\u2019t give you an outlook, I know there is some speculation out there at various times but I will be hesitant to try to give you an outlook until we know more about both the cause and extent of the leaks and therefore what it\u2019s going to take to repair and get that equipment back in service.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay this is helpful. And my second question is on \u2013 it also relates to the production, and 2014 production. Thank you for the color on Groningen. I guess there, is there any ability to offset volumes from other European fields as it\u2019s largely a demand driven market. And secondly another area which has been which profitable and a marquee investment for Exxon in Kearl LNG, I mean any color there on the relative contribution as you move through various contract thresholds in those contracts would be helpful. Thanks.", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah let me start off with Groningen. As you know it is the swing field in Europe and tends to take the balance of what\u2019s needed, depending on weather typically unless there are some supply disruption and so that\u2019s really what drives the production there year-to-year more so than capacity. In terms of ability to offset you know we\u2019re already working everything we got, as you know our continental Europe conventional gas is on decline, North Sea gas is on decline so we do feed LNG into that circuit out of the Middle-East. But it has to compete with prices that you can get in Asia Pacific.", "So we\u2019ll be looking to optimize that but again under normal circumstances loss were about 100 MCF but we\u2019ll be looking optimize around that to the best we can.", "If talking about Qatar I think the one thing to keep in mind is other than the AKG project, all the rest of the trains are joint ventures, they are not PSEs. So they don\u2019t react the same way that PSEs do. They do all have unique fiscal terms associated with them. But I can tell you as time goes on we don\u2019t see any significant impact on the earnings contribution, anything that would be material. So we continue to remain focused keeping that equipment up and running. We had a terrific year on uptime and reliability and that enabled us to take advantage of some very strong margins at available prices through particularly in the Asia-Pac. So it continues to be a terrific investment for us.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Great, David. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. Good morning, David.", "David Rosenthal", "Hey good morning Doug.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Hi, I have a couple of questions also, if I may. The first one is on the long life nature of some of your assets. It just kind of occurs to me obviously you haven\u2019t given a reserve replacement number for the year yet but as your portfolio shifts towards the likes of Qatar and the likes of Kashagan and so on Kearl all these are very long life asset. What is the determination internally about the need for reserve replacement to be at or above 100% when you have such huge piece of your portfolio that doesn\u2019t decline on a multi decade basis? And I have got a follow-up, [as I think of] really the capital intensity of the overall portfolio.", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah let me hit the capital intensity first and I will use that to back into your original question. We have been in a very capital intensive mode in the upstream over the last few years as we recapitalized and invest in a number of these big projects. Some of you mentioned coming out of Qatar and into Kearl, Papua New Guinea LNG, Groningen LNG, the Kashagan of course, you have seen a ramp up in CapEx on these long life projects but as we talked about in the March analyst meeting last year we do have an expectation of rolling that upstream CapEx over a little bit as we go forward and we\u2019ll give you an update on that in March. But we continue to progress that.", "In terms of having a target of 100% reserve replacement we don\u2019t really have a target. In other words we\u2019re not going to go out and do things that are not optimal just to achieve 100% replacement target. We basically you know the company and the organization well. We span the world looking for good opportunities, good resources to get access to. And if they are commercial we\u2019ll put the investment capital and human capital in there to development.", "We have been fortune over the last many years that the summation of all this effort has achieved 100% or greater than 100% reserves replacement. But I am glad you asked the question because I do want everyone to know that we do not go and spend the shareholders\u2019 money to reach any kind of target like reserves replacement. It\u2019s the outcome of our very disciplined analytical process and again making sure that the CapEx is being spent in those areas, that have the best opportunity to generate long-term value for the shareholder.", "And I think last thing I mentioned Doug as we look around the world and you look at our exploration portfolio one of the things that\u2019s really nice today is our ability to be selective amongst that portfolio and pick and choose those opportunities that we want to go after and do the most attractive ones and the reserve adds will be the fall out of that. But thanks for asking question.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "So my follow up there is very quickly is on the Middle East again, as specific to the ADCO concession. I know its fixed margin and relatively low in the grand scheme of things but can you just explain for us what the situation is with that contract. I believe that expired in January 1 and whether or not you have any chance of re-tripping that at some point and I will leave it there, thanks.", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expired on January 10th of this year. We did have a 9.5% interest in that. That worked out to about 140,000 barrels a day in production. We are no longer in that concession. I will tell you, you mentioned fixed margin contracts, while it was 140,000 barrels of production the unit profitability of that was down at the lower end of our profitable barrels. So that\u2019s the status on the onshore. I really couldn\u2019t comment on any discussions, opportunities forward-looking thoughts other than to kind of give you a status of where we are today.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "All right thanks, David.", "David Rosenthal", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.", "Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Hey good morning David.", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning Ed.", "Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Seems real fishing for your slides in March on the production volumes, so why not fish again, just very quickly, the reduction in the West Qurna stake how much did you include longer term in the slide that you put up each year in terms of the new projects for West Qurna?", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah what I can tell us is we put up that slide in March of every year, and it\u2019s important to know this, we do it on an apples-to-apples basis. So we assume the status quo and the same as prior year prices. So it allows you folks to get a look at what we would be status quo, so no assessments every March in terms of acquisitions, divestments, contract, expiries and all those sort of things.", "So last year we would have had an assumption of the status quo in the outlook. Now I can tell you that the way the contracts work we don\u2019t book a lot of barrels in that area. And so the reduction will not be significant I don\u2019t have a specific number for you other than to tell you it won\u2019t be significant in the overall context of our production.", "Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. And then just trying to shift the conversation on can you talk a little bit about where you are in terms of oily rig count again in North America, some of your plans obviously the industry has announced some success in the Duvernay, you\u2019ve got some good acreage in Woodford and the core of the Bakken and the Permian, just a quick sort of update on where you are in the oily drilling in North America? Thanks.", "David Rosenthal", "Sure. As you can tell by the sequential quarter-to-quarter sustained increase in U.S. liquids volumes we have been really orienting our rigs towards the more liquid areas. Biggest places for us, the Bakken, the Permian and the Woodford Ardmore, most all of our rigs are running in those areas. We continue to ramp up.", "We\u2019re adding rigs in the Permian for example, both for conventional liquids as well testing some of the unconventional. We are drilling in the Montney and the Duvernay, as you suggested, an increase in the activity there as well as in the Bakken. So if you look at the rigs we\u2019re running today it\u2019s not 100% but it\u2019s probably 85% or so all of our rigs are working in liquids focused plays. And thus you have seen that significant increase in production. We are bringing a lot of wells onto sales every quarter and continue to ramp that up.", "We are testing new areas, new zones and in these plays, the Maynard and the Ardmore for example looks very promising to us, we will be getting more wells down there, the Wolfcamp out in the Permian and a number of those plays. So we are very pleased with the acreage we\u2019ve been able to acquire and get into and ramping up pretty dramatically.", "And if you look at a number of these things that are occurring over the years, over this year a lot of it gets back to the commentary we made at the Analyst Meeting about working on improving unit profitability. And you do that by limiting or reducing your exposure to low profit barrels, working on fiscal terms where you can and putting your human and financial capabilities in those areas that generate above average incremental profitability and we\u2019ve been executing those efforts this year and we will give you a better update at the March Analyst meeting on the extent of that program.", "Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from to Paul Cheng with Barclays.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays", "Hey, David. Good morning.", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning, Paul. How are you?", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays", "Very good. Sorry, not to beat a dead horse too much. If I look at your last year presentation in the Analyst Meeting on the production profile, can you tell us that for 2014, 2015 roughly how much is building into that particular profile you share from the Kashagan, from the Abu Dhabi, also [onshore] and also on Groningen?", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah. I don\u2019t have a specific number for Kashagan. Abu Dhabi would have been something in the neighborhood of the 140,000 barrels a day I mentioned and Groningen would have been, whatever the equivalent would have been again for an average year. So I think the important thing to think about is the difference would be kind of what we have mentioned today for both Groningen and the onshore. And again we will be giving you a full update on our outlook that will incorporate those changes and many others that we have heading into 2014 when we get together in March.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays", "Okay. Second question. When I am looking at the Imperial in the fourth quarter they report downstream earning of $625 million Canadian dollar. So if you adjust for your working interest and the foreign currency, it would suggest that your share of their downstream earning is above $417 million, meanwhile that your U.S. downstream only report $319 million. Does that mean that outside Canada the rest of your global downstream operation actually loss of a $100 million or that is some different other accounting adjustment that we didn\u2019t avail?", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah, let me give you a little perspective on that. First of all as I mentioned a few minutes ago, one of the issues we did see in the quarter was price timing affects about $250 million negative in the U.S. and that impacted those earnings. We do see weakness in our European and Asia Pacific businesses out there, margins are weak, the economy is a bit sluggish.", "So both on the refining and the chemical side you are not seeing an earnings contribution there that you would see in an up cycle because we are at \u2013 we are kind of \u2013 as I\u2019ve said before we are at the bottom of the cycle margins. We also had in the fourth quarter a higher turnaround and maintenance load in Europe. Our Antwerp refinery for example had a major turnaround. So you are looking at some volume impacts there. But clearly we are optimizing the European and Asia Pacific footprint as best as we can with the integration between refining, chemicals and lubes. But those are weak markets compared to the U.S and Canada without question.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays", "And I just sneak in one real quick one.", "David Rosenthal", "Sure.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays", "For the quarter do you have a cash proceed from asset sales of $1.8 billion. Can you tell us what is the after sales gain in the quarter and breakdown by segment?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure. If you look at the, first of all the proceeds from asset sales, we had a number of asset sales in the quarter. I mentioned our partial sell down in Iraq and we had a number of sales in the U.S. and in Canada, additional service stations as we continue to progress that effort. We booked a films divestment on the chemicals side. So a number of things contributed to that $1.8 billion.", "In terms of an earnings contribution in the fourth quarter that total was about $1 billion all-in, in the quarter across all the businesses. And that compared to about $400 million in the fourth quarter of last year.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays", "Dave do you have a breakdown by segment on that $1 billion?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure. If you look in the upstream right about $775 million in the downstream at about $225 million order of magnitude.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays", "Thank you.", "David Rosenthal", "Those are absolute numbers.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.", "Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil", "Hi, David good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I couldn\u2019t help but ask a question on natural gas here given the recent spike that we have seen. I know the volumes for Exxon have been progressively in decline due to the activity but I am just curious is there a certain pricing level where you may get interested in reengaging in activity and I guess tied in with that I know historically the company doesn\u2019t hedge but with the recent move we\u2019ve seen is that an opportunity to may be lock in some economics and get more active?", "David Rosenthal", "I will hit the last one first and then back up. No, we don\u2019t hedge oil and gas prices and I wouldn\u2019t expect that to change here. So in terms of natural gas pricing you have seen some firming here in the last several weeks. We had a very cold winter in the U.S. and the demand for gas in the power gen and heating has been very strong. And so we\u2019ve seen a fluctuation on the upside for that. But we don\u2019t change our activity levels and investment plans to any significant extent on short term price movements in the commodities. We do have tremendous flexibility in our operations.", "I think our drill well inventory here in the U.S. is about 50,000 wells. So we certainly have the capability to move our activity around. But again we don\u2019t typically move dramatically one way or another on a short term price spike or decline. But do acknowledge that we have seen some price uptick here recently.", "Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil", "Okay, fair enough. And second question is on Tanzania obviously you had some really good success there and from what I gathered it looks like sufficient resources to probably move forward with the development. So I am curious can you give us an idea of may be timing on potential FID and may be what additional resources you may need to kind of move forward?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure, first of all it all starts with that resource and we have found a very high quality gas resource out there with the wells that we drilled so far. Like I mentioned earlier 17 to 20 TCF gas in place. I think one of the things that\u2019s encouraging is we still have several more prospects on that block that haven\u2019t been drilled yet. And so we are continuing to drill, we\u2019ll drill some more this year. We\u2019ll be doing some appraisal drilling and some more Wild Cat exploration activity. So that continues to go very well.", "In terms of forward planning we are in the early stages of planning for the development of that block, working on things like site selection. You\u2019re probably aware that us and our partner Statoil had worked with BG and Ophir to completing an evaluation of potential sites for our common onshore LNG plant. And we have made a recommendation to the government of Tanzania regarding that.", "The next step as you progress would be moving into early feed to kind of see what you have there. But it\u2019s a little too early to be talking about any potential FID date at this time. But clearly, as we always do if you have what looks to be an excellent resource you put the human capital on it and get to thinking about development and optimization and I can assure you that, that process is well underway. We\u2019ll probably be able to get a little better update in March as well on that opportunity but for now I\u2019ll just say we\u2019re moving right along and very pleased with this world class discovery that we\u2019ve made.", "Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil", "Thanks, David.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Arjun Murti with Goldman Sachs.", "Arjun Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thanks, David, just a couple of follow ups, just first on the natural gas point. I fully appreciate Exxon classically does not adjust to the short term price swings. Is it reasonable to think that kind of mid-single digit decline you have had will continue for the next several years or as you assess the XTO and your own resource base between the Marcellus and Woodford and these other areas do you see greater confidence in the class of the resources that the decline rates might be lower or different than what you have done say over the last year and a half?", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah that\u2019s a multi-part question, both of those can be independent or work together. Certainly we have continued to make good progress in terms of productivity, well rates, down spacing, optimizing our completions and drilling. So we have been able to kind of make the progress we always thought we would when we acquired XTO and combined their folks with our folks and looking at some of these things. So that continues to improve.", "It\u2019s hard to give an overall decline curve because as you know that\u2019s \u2013 a lot of time that depends on well work activity and workovers and various other things and a lot of that will be driven by the activity levels, which of course are dependent on longer term price outlooks.", "So I think you know from our perspective with the resources there, the opportunities are there, we know all these plays, we know how to produce more gas and when the market needs the gas we\u2019ll provide it. But so it\u2019s a market-driven activity and the outcome in terms of production and reserves and decline will be based on the outcome of those activities as opposed to any target that we might set. But we can adjust quickly. I mean we do have the capability to adjust quickly if the market needs the gas.", "Arjun Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "That\u2019s great. And unrelated follow-up, you mentioned the partial sell-down in West Qurna in Iraq to 25%. I think a few years ago you also bought some acreage in Kurdistan. Can you provide any update in your activities there? I think there had been some questions at least at the time as to whether you could pursue activities in southern Iraq and Kurdistan. So any thoughts on what you are doing in Kurdistan would be helpful?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure. If you look at the Kurdistan region in northern Iraq I can tell you that we continue to progress all six of the PSE contracts we have there and meet our commitments. Specifically we do have drilling operations underway in one of our blocks. That drilling is ongoing. I don\u2019t have any report out for you yet but those operations are underway and we continue to do seismic and other operations on our other blocks in preparation for drilling there.", "So I think in summary across Iraq all of our contracts in the north and the south we continue to meet our commitments and we continue to progress our operations in all of the areas and I am pleased to say that all of them are progressing as per the plan and doing quite well.", "Arjun Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "That\u2019s great. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Asit Sen with Cowen & Company.", "Asit Sen \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Thank you. Good morning, David.", "David Rosenthal", "Hey Asit, how are you?", "Asit Sen \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Good, good. Two quick questions, first on asset sales. It looks like the $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter did not include the portion of Hong Kong Power. Could you update us on the Hong Kong Power sale?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure. You are right. That $1.8 billion did not include any proceeds from the Hong Kong Power sale. As you are aware we have reached agreements to divest our interest in those facilities. Those approval efforts are ongoing but it\u2019s not closed and it won\u2019t close for a little while but the process is moving along. We would expect to close that deal sometime later this year.", "Asit Sen \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Okay. And the second one is on PNG LNG. It\u2019s very unusual to see a big LNG project coming on ahead of schedule. My question is what sort of volumetric contribution do we expect in Q4 in the ramp-up phase?", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah I might just add to your comment about how unusual it is to see one of these mega projects stay on schedule. I will also note that we\u2019re still on budget and we\u2019ve not increased the cost outlook on that project since the outlook we gave. So we are ahead of schedule and on budget.", "I don\u2019t have a specific volume outlook for you for the fourth quarter. It\u2019s all going to depend on how we get this thing ramped up. But I think, as I mentioned earlier, we have been saying we have first deliveries in the second half and now we moved that up a little more concrete to the third quarter. And as we progress commissioning we will be in a better position here in March to maybe give you a little better update in terms of what to expect. But everything is working well, the drilling, all the commissioning, feeding the gas, the equipment and that\u2019s why we are able to give a more specific target of the third quarter. But we look forward to giving you a better update here in a month or so.", "Asit Sen \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Faisal Khan with Citi.", "Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi", "Thank you and good morning David.", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning Faisal.", "Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi", "Just want to clarify the gain on the asset sale of $1 billion. Is that for the year or for the quarter?", "David Rosenthal", "Thanks for that follow-up, so that we can be clear. The absolute gain in the fourth quarter was $1 billion and that compares with a gain of about $600 million in the fourth quarter of last year. So we had a change of a positive $400 million.", "Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi", "Okay, understood. And just on exploration expense, it\u2019s sort of been elevated for last three quarters and I understand some of that is coming out of Russia. But can you give us an idea of how these numbers were to trend because you\u2019ve gone from roughly 450 to over 700 a quarter and it seemed to have an outsize effect on some of your expenses? Any sort of clarification or sort of guidance in terms of where that should be would be helpful.", "David Rosenthal", "Well, the biggest driver of the exploration expense as you note has been our pick-up in activity in Russia and it\u2019s in all areas. So we are talking about all the work that we did this summer in the Kara Sea, the seismic we have been running, the efforts we have in West Siberia as well as across the Black Sea, Northern Black Sea and then over in Russia.", "So we have had a lot of exploration activity in support of what is going to be a very robust drilling program this year and next year in a number of these areas. So that is ongoing. It\u2019s nothing that we haven\u2019t planned or expected as we came into this year, and look forward to this year. But I don\u2019t have an outlook in terms of a forward look.", "Again that\u2019s one of those areas we will talk a little more about in March. But dry hole expense has been kind of low this past year. So hadn\u2019t been a big contributor to that. So it\u2019s been just a lot of work identifying those drillable prospects and preparing for again an active drilling campaign.", "Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi", "Thank you, David. Appreciate the time.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Allen Good with Morningstar.", "Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar", "Good morning David.", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning Allen.", "Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar", "I wondered if you just press you maybe for a bit more detail on the Western Siberia and Tight Oil campaign, whether it be maybe rig counts or planned wells for 2014 and maybe even what you anticipate production exit rate in 2014 might be?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure, I\u2019ll be happy to give you an update. We\u2019ve got a lot of activity going on, lot of geo technical work, seismic work. As I mentioned in the last quarter call we did have a lot of effort in terms of entering some old well bores and doing some other activity in the fourth quarter of last year. As we head into this year, now\u2019s the time to move on to a drilling program or we would drill some horizontal wells and see how we can get various areas to produce.", "One of the things that\u2019s really important for us with the size of our acreage position is to make sure we understand where we are in the play, what are the most prospective areas and that takes a lot of analysis, so you don\u2019t waste a lot of money drilling wells. But we\u2019ve got a lot of expertise in this area that we acquired from XTO. We are bringing that to full bear, along with some of our own technology that we have. And we are looking forward to get some more wells down this year, testing the production capability of some of these areas.", "But it would certainly be premature to give any indication or thinking about exit rates or production rates because we\u2019re early on in this analysis. And again it\u2019s very huge resource opportunity in front of us and it certainly behooves us to take our time and go about this in a disciplined manner so that we don\u2019t waste a lot of money while at the same time finding out what this very exciting play is capable of doing and this will be a big year for us.", "Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar", "Okay, thanks for that. And then I know you don\u2019t give guidance on asset sales or what you may see in marketing but earlier this week, I guess one of your peers came out and sort of indicated that he is going to sell a pipeline or an asset here in the U.S. And I was just wondering presumably you are sitting on a lot of mid-stream assets that may unfairly receive the value that they would in a market being incorporated within Exxon given the level of disclosure and the size of your business.", "Is there any interest, and I know MLP may be out of question, but any interest in potentially trying to monetize some of these mid-stream assets you have or do you think you just have more value ultimately to operating them and then integrate in your operations as opposed to selling them.", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah, it\u2019s interesting if you look back over the last couple of years, so 2011 and 2012, we actually did divest a fairly significant chunk of those mid-stream assets that we had, not only in the U.S. but elsewhere. And that was a portion of those large asset sale gains that we had and cash flows in those two years.", "I can\u2019t give any specific outlook or asset but as you would expect we are continuously looking at all of our assets, including our midstream assets, what those values are to us internally and what they might be on the market. And we test the market occasionally with some of these. So again they are not sitting there and not getting looked at and evaluated but it\u2019s all part of our program to look at the entire logistics footprint that we have.", "And so I mentioned the Edmonton rail facility we\u2019re building so where it\u2019s optimal for us we\u2019ll add mid-stream facilities and where some midstream assets that we have are worth more to somebody else than they are to us we will divest them. Again no specific outlook or assets but we are continuously looking at that entire portfolio.", "Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar", "Okay, great, thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.", "Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Yeah, good morning.", "David Rosenthal", "Hello.", "Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo", "I guess, just to follow up a little bit on the chemicals business, and there\u2019ve been a few questions on it already, but I just wanted to sort of understand, the changes you saw in the fourth quarter and Exxon wasn\u2019t particularly unique. We definitely saw greater competition out there. But as we look forward in to \u201814 what\u2019s going on in terms of new competition pricing and all that. Kind of let us know how you fall into that or how you, how you would expect \u201814 to unfold on the chemical side.", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah, as I have on a number of other questions I can\u2019t give an outlook today on any kind of financial parameters for the business. But one of the things we\u2019ve seen recently \u2013 well, first of all we\u2019ll start here in the U.S., we continue to take advantage of a very good market there. Demand has picked up a little bit and of course, gas cracking is also very attractive business for us. And we have been fortunate in that we\u2019ve been able to run our facilities along the Gulf Coast flat out here over the last quarter and therefore make the production we need to meet the market demand.", "And so those margins in the U.S. remain healthy, demand pick up a little bit, export opportunities also very attractive, and we\u2019re maximizing all that. On the other side of the planet margins continue to be quite weak in the Asia Pacific area. We did have some capacity come on last year. And it\u2019s typical in our business there\u2019s never a perfect match between capacity additions and demand growth.", "Demand growth tends to be out there for a while and then people put on the facilities and they tend to come in on in chunks and for a while you\u2019ll have supply outstripping demand. And we\u2019ve seen that in a number of areas, a number of products particularly in the Asia-Pac area. Those have a tendency to balance themselves out over time. We are also seeing some demand pick up in China and the rest of the Asia-Pac area and that is helpful.", "I mentioned the specialties business. We have seen some weakness there, particularly in Europe, again both from the economic situation there as well as additional industry capacity that\u2019s come on. So I\u2019d characterize it as kind of normal cyclical business for the chemical industry across many years. You have got the U.S., at kind of top of the cycle, business conditions today in Europe and Asia-Pac kind of at the bottom of the cycle.", "And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve over time invested in each of these places where we can bring some technology or get a feed slate advantage or a logistics advantage in order to be able to supply all of those regions through the business cycle. But most importantly be able to take advantage when you get an upside and we are certainly well positioned to do that with our facilities.", "Combine that with the level of integration we have and if you look overall it is kind of a tough market but we did make almost $4 billion this year in that business and that\u2019s pretty strong performance.", "Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Fully agreed, thanks. And then the unrelated question, you mentioned in the press release about LNG for Alaska. I was just curious is there anything you can do to help us understand more conventional business North Slope, Prudhoe in Alaska, you had the tax change that the government put through up there. We\u2019ve seen some indications that the other participants in Alaska are getting a little more active.", "Just wondered is, how does Exxon participate in that? Is it basically along with the others? So maybe there is a little bit of growth coming from Alaska in the near future. Or if it\u2019s you are waiting for something larger like the more offshore drilling that looks like it continues to slip out to the future?", "David Rosenthal", "What we have seen across the business up there is pretty much what you would expect. Lower taxes have led to folks to take another look at their investment opportunities. And investments that were not viable under the old regime could very well be viable under the new regime. So you have seen some activity up there.", "As you know we are a large participant owner in Prudhoe Bay. We are not the operator but any of the growth that you see there in some of the projects and activity increase that you have seen announced and underway in Prudhoe Bay, up on the North Slope, we would participate in. And so obviously everybody up there is looking at that and it\u2019s still a very key resource for us. And as opportunities become attractive, of course with our partners we would be willing to invest in that. So I think that\u2019s pretty straightforward on the North Slope.", "If you look at the Alaska LNG opportunity for us, as you know, it\u2019s one of many opportunities we are looking at across the globe for LNG. We did, as you read in the press, have heads of agreement here recently, another very positive milestone. It sets guiding principles, terms and conditions to progress the work on the project and so we are continuing to progress that.", "We have, after a long evaluation process looking at locations, we have identified an industrial site near Nikiski as a lead site for the potential plant and terminal. We are looking at other sites. But I think the message is, that\u2019s potentially a very large, very complex project. And so all of the stakeholders are progressing, the analysis and looking at that project in due course and we of course are a big part of that.", "Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robert Kessler with Tudor, Pickering, Holt and Company.", "Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.", "Hi, good morning. I see you have finalized the Canadian rail terminal project plans. Can you tell us what the total CapEx will be for that 230,000 railway facility? And then how you think about it more strategically? I know at least to me Exxon seems more like a vertical integration player where you see an opportunity in your downstream and you set up a midstream opportunity here, that you really integrate. But others seem to be using rail as more of an optionality.", "So if the spreads get to a certain distance and other transport routes are not available you use them kind of opportunistically. So can you tell me how you are thinking about the expected utilization rates at that facility, is it more of a base run you are at 100% or you are leaving it out there as an option?", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah. I think, let me hit the first part of your question first. We would expect the all-in capital cost for that JV to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $200 million to $250 million and that\u2019s a 50-50 joint venture. So we have got about half of that.", "You know the terminal we will have, the max capacity could be upwards of 250,000 barrels a day. Out of that we\u2019re looking at utilizing initially about 100,000 barrels a day to move our expanded production into the market. With the growing production of Western Canadian crudes so both heavy crudes and oil sands it\u2019s prudent to be working at all of the logistics opportunities so that you do get a lot of optionality as you mentioned, but also the flexibility to be able to better pinpoint the destination of some of your crudes as various regional opportunities present themselves.", "So we\u2019re taking full advantage of all the pipeline opportunities that are out there and working on that. Other modes of transportation by water are also being utilized. And then again as is prudent we\u2019re looking at the railcar option. So it\u2019s all about optionality, flexibility and being able to take advantage of spreads and opportunities to maximize the overall value and we have been working on that for quite a while.", "The other thing you have in the flexibility on the transportation piece is it really helps us on both the integration with our own refining circuit as well as have any opportunity and viability to make third-party sales. And so the more options you have the more flexibility you have, the better off you are to divert production to areas different than what you might have originally planned. So we\u2019re taking all of that into consideration.", "Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.", "Makes sense. Thanks for the clarification.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.", "Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey guys. Well just one from me and this is a high level question. On the day that the Senate Energy Committee is debating crude oil export policy I know that Exxon\u2019s perspective on this is kind of we closely watch. So any thoughts on the issue and where the company stands?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure. I would be happy to talk about that. It\u2019s a topical subject. First of all our response is principal-based as you would probably guess. And as a company we fully support free markets, free trade. We oppose any barriers or restrictions to free trade and open investment across the value chain in the energy sector. And over time I think it\u2019s pretty clear that barriers to free trade can actually lead to higher prices, dampen economic growth and prosperity and in this case could potentially harm energy security by limiting diversity of supplies.", "So trade is good, free trade is the best way to maximize the economic value of any enterprise including the oil and gas enterprise, generates the most jobs, generates the most revenue to the taxing authorities. And so across the business that\u2019s what we support and we would not advocate putting any restrictions at any point along a manufacturing value chain even if it might benefit some part of our business.", "In addition to crude oil we strongly support unrestricted LNG exports, even though we are a very large petrochemical company and consume a lot of petrochemical feed stock. So the bottom line big supporters of free markets and free trade, level playing field for all competitors and then let the market do what it does best.", "Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "I appreciate it guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from [Viraj Kataria] with RBC.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, David thanks for taking my question, I have two, if I may. Especially on LNG you touched on it a couple of times in the call. I wondered if you could talk through your options to expanding this growth area outside of Tanzania and PNG. And secondly I wonder if you could talk a little bit about your thought process when setting dividends. You obviously have a very strong balance sheet and the highest returns in the industry and you could afford a significantly higher dividend. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that.", "David Rosenthal", "Sure. Let me start with LNG because we\u2019re very pleased to have a broad opportunity set in front of us. In addition to Papua New Guinea, Australia and Tanzania, as you mentioned we have a very attractive opportunity in the U.S. Gulf Coast where we already have a very large re-gas facility. So a lot of that investment is already on the ground. And we have an opportunity to add liquefaction capacity there. And one of the things that makes our project unique is we also have re-gas capacity available in Europe from some investments that we made in prior years.", "So we have the opportunity to simply add liquefaction capacity on the front-end and then export that LNG, take advantage of a number of opportunities, not least of which is capacity, we have to regasify in Europe. We have received a permit for free trade agreement countries and we have had a permanent application in for some time for non-free trade agreements and that continues to be a nice opportunity.", "We also are looking at the possibility of viability of LNG exports out of British Colombia and Canada. We have a very large resource base in western Canada of natural gas and we do have efforts underway and are progressing. In fact we just received a permit approval for a potential up to 30 MTA facility in western Canada and we\u2019re working on site selection and other things there.", "Then of course Alaska which we just mentioned a minute ago. Huge resource, great opportunity but again like the other projects very high capital cost, very complex. It will be extremely important to have attractive stable fiscal terms, as it is in any area but that\u2019s also an opportunity for us.", "So again it\u2019s all about having a broad balanced portfolio of opportunities, so that you can select those that are the most attractive. But you don\u2019t find yourself in a position where you have to do something that\u2019s not attractive and our LNG opportunity set certainly fits that case.", "In terms of dividends you know we have been pretty briskly increasingly the dividend over the last few years. We had a fairly significant dividend increase. I think it\u2019s about 20% or so in 2012, another 11% increase this past year and it extends a very long period of time that we have been increasing dividend so I think we have been responsive in that area.", "In terms of going forward I wouldn\u2019t expect any change to our overall philosophy with regards to the dividend. We do expect to pay a consistent dividend that grows overtime and obviously we are able to do that given the strong cash flows the business generates, our strong financial capacity. So don\u2019t have any outlook or guidance or anything other than to say that I would expect our philosophy going forward to be the same as it has been historically.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Perfect. Thank you.", "David Rosenthal", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Rosenthal I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.", "David Rosenthal", "Okay I simply like to thank everybody for their participation on the call. I appreciate your questions today, very important to our business and look forward to seeing everyone here in a few weeks at the Analyst Meeting in March. So thank you very much.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning, and welcome to Exxon Mobil's Third Quarter Earnings Call and Webcast. The focus of this call is Exxon Mobil's financial and operating results for the third quarter of 2010. We will refer to the slides that are available through the Investor section of our website.", "Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2. Statements of future events or conditions are forward-looking statements. Actual results, including resource recoveries, volume growth and project outcomes, could differ materially due to factors I discussed and factors noted in our SEC filings. Please see Factors Affecting Future Results and the Form 8-K we furnished this morning, which are available through the Investors Section of our website. Please also see the Frequently Used Terms and the 2009 financial and operating review on our website. This material defines key terms I will use today and shows Exxon Mobil's net interest in specific projects.", "Moving to Slide 3, we have provided an overview of some of the external factors impacting third quarter results. We continue to see the effects of mixed economic activity, with ongoing uncertainty in the United States and Europe, offset in part by a stronger growth in the developing world, mainly in the Asia-Pacific and Latin American regions. The pace of the global economic recovery and the resulting near-term supply and demand balances have been impacted by these effects.", "Crude oil prices remained well above levels of a year ago. Natural gas prices and Downstream margins have also shown improvement relative to 2009. Chemical margins have improved relative to last year, but have been negatively impacted by new industry capacity coming online.", "Now turning to the third quarter financial results, as shown on Slide 4. Exxon Mobil's third quarter 2010 earnings, excluding special items, were $7.4 billion, an increase of $2.6 billion from the third quarter of 2009. Earnings per share, excluding special items were $1.44, up $0.46 from a year ago.", "The corporation distributed more than $5.2 billion to shareholders in the third quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $3 billion was distributed to purchase shares. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to increase to $5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010.", "CapEx in the third quarter was $8.8 billion, up $2.3 billion from 2009, primarily due to the inclusion of XTO activity and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. We continue to invest in robust projects through the business cycle to help meet global demand for crude oil, natural gas and finished products.", "Our cash generation remains very strong. At the end of the third quarter, our cash balance was $12 billion and debt was just over $18 billion after reducing the XTO debt assumed in the acquisition by over $3 billion.", "Moving to Slide 5. Exxon Mobil's earnings, excluding special items, increased $2.6 billion from the third quarter of 2009, reflecting strong results across all business lines. Upstream earnings increased $1.5 billion, driven by higher crude oil and natural gas prices and significant volume growth.", "The Downstream saw notable improvement over the 2009 third quarter, with an increase in earnings of $835 million, largely due to stronger industry Refining margins. Chemicals continued its solid performance as earnings increased $353 million on stronger margins. Corporate and Financing expenses were $506 million during the quarter, up $23 million versus the third quarter of 2009.", "As shown on Slide 6, Exxon Mobil's earnings, excluding special items, declined $210 million from the second quarter of 2010. Upstream earnings increased $131 million, primarily due to volume growth. While Downstream earnings were down $60 million due to lower industry margins. Chemical earnings decreased from the second quarter by $139 million on lower commodity margins. Compared with the second quarter of 2010, Corporate and Financing expenses increased by $142 million, mainly due to the impact of retiring a portion of XTO's long term debt.", "Moving next to the Upstream results on Slide 8. During the quarter, Exxon Mobil began production from the Odoptu field, the latest development phase of the Sakhalin-1 project in far eastern Russia. This region is one of the most challenging sub-arctic environments in the world. The project is performing well and current production is approximately 50,000 barrels of oil per day.", "Employing world-class extended rig drilling, the project started up on schedule and within development cost expectations. Since start up of the first phase at Chayvo in 2005, the Sakhalin-1 project has produced over 270 million barrels of oil for export to world markets.", "Moving to the United States, our LNG terminal at Golden Pass on the Texas Gulf Coast recently received a commissioning cargo. Once commissioning activities are complete, the start up of this terminal will represent the final stage of the integrated project between Exxon Mobil and Qatar Petroleum that includes the entire LNG supply chain, production, liquefaction, LNG ships and LNG receiving terminals. Our four trains in Qatar with annual capacity of 7.8 million metric tons each are all running at capacity. And our Al Khaleej Gas Phase 2 domestic gas project continues to benefit from strong local demand. These facilities are well positioned to help meet the growing global gas demand in Asia, Europe and the United States.", "Moving to Slide 9. Exxon Mobil continues to make good progress in Iraq. We have completed our six-month contract milestones, including submission of the rehabilitation plant and the work program and budget. We have awarded contracts for well work over operations, camp refurbishment and offices. And recently commenced well work and tie-in activities. We remain on our original timetable for execution and production ramp-up.", "Moving to Slide 10. The initial development of our Kearl Oil Sands Project in Canada is on schedule to commence operations by year end 2012, with construction now approximately 25% complete. Our original plan developed Kearl in three phases to produce more than 300,000 barrels of oil per day. However, by leveraging recent learnings, we reconfigured the project include debottlenecking and expansion phases, which will increase production to the regulatory limit of approximately 345,000 barrels per day. We expect the spending profile early in the project to be higher as a result of revisions to comply with the changing regulatory environments and specific sites conditions, with full lease development still yielding attractive unit development costs.", "We also continued to progress our global portfolio of high-quality liquids projects. Slide 11 provides an update on several of these projects. At Hibernia, the south extension project received approval for the development plan. The southern extension will be produced using the current Hibernia gravity base structure facility that will require additional drilling to access the resource. The plan is to drill production wells from the Hibernia platform and water injection wells from a combination of platform and subsea drilling. Platform drilling for the southern extension unit is currently planned to begin in late 2011 or early 2012.", "The Hebron Project is progressing and first oil is anticipated before the end of 2017. We recently awarded our front-end engineering and design contract for the top sides and plan to award the gravity base structure contract before the end of the year.", "In addition, we continue to progress a number of worldwide oil drilling programs. For example, we have recommenced drilling on our Ringhorne Platform in Norway, and have an ongoing program at Barrow in the U.K. sector of the North Sea. We have also ongoing programs in Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea, Chad, Angola, Canada and the United States.", "Turning now to our unconventional portfolio and starting on Slide 12. The ongoing integration of XTO is progressing well and the transfer of existing technology and experience will provide significant benefits. As an example, we are progressing consolidation of unconventional activities to leverage XTO's experience and operational capabilities in place such as the Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Marcellus.", "During the quarter, Exxon Mobil finalized a merger agreement with Ellora Energy. This acquisition has increased our position in the attractive Haynesville Bossier plays by 46,000 acres and added current production and pipeline capacity. In addition, our gas marketing team is working with XTO to optimize shipping, processing and marketing activities across our United States portfolio. We are also capturing reverse integration benefits in legacy Exxon Mobil operations both in the United States and overseas.", "Recently, a team from XTO shared best practices to optimize our evaluation and development planning activities in Canada, Indonesia and Germany. XTO brings a rich data set including thousands of core samples and an extensive fuel testing database, which our research lab will leverage to further our proprietary shale research. We also continued to see low attrition rates. Overall, we are very pleased with how the XTO integration is proceeding and the potential benefits we see over the long term.", "Moving to Slide 13. In Canada, the Horn River Basin is a world-class Devonian shale gas resource that is currently in the evaluation stage. We hold over 300,000 net acres and are one of the largest net acreage holders in the basin.", "In the 2009, 2010 winter dealing season, we drilled eight vertical wells and two horizontal wells. Completion and testing operations were completed on the two horizontal wells in August of this year. Five wells are planned for the next drilling season which will begin in late 2010 or early 2011. Additionally, we completed the 2009, 2010 non-operating drilling program and testing operations are currently underway.", "Moving to Slide 14. In Europe, we have commenced drilling our first coal bed methane well in Germany, and are implementing a work program to evaluate the shale gas and coal bed methane potential of our acreage. In Indonesia, we hold respective coal bed methane acreage in the Barito Basin totaling approximately 290,000 net acres. We plan to conduct pilot tests to evaluate the viability of Indonesian coal bed methane as a gas resource and expect to initiate exploration drilling in December of 2010, followed by pilot testing in the first half of 2011.", "We have drilled our fourth exploration well in the deepwater Block SC 56 in the Sulu Sea in the Philippines and have discovered natural gas. We have now encountered natural gas in three of the four wells drilled to date and are analyzing data from all the wells to determine future plans.", "Turning now to the Upstream operating results and starting on Slide 15. Upstream earnings in the third quarter were $5.5 billion, up $1.5 billion from the third quarter of 2009. Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel were $13.34. As you will see in the 10-Q, which will be filed next week, third quarter upstream earnings included a positive $150 million contribution from XTO's operations.", "Higher crude oil and natural gas realizations increased Upstream earnings by over $1 billion. Worldwide, crude oil realizations were up almost $8 a barrel and natural gas realizations were up early $0.70 per 1,000 cubic feet from the third quarter of 2009.", "Earnings further increased by $270 million due to higher volume and mix effects, driven by project volumes in Qatar and the addition of XTO, partly offset by net field decline. All other effects increased earnings by $150 million, primarily due to favorable tax items.", "Moving to Slide 16. Oil equivalent volumes increased 21% from the third quarter of last year. Entitlement volume effects, including price and spend impacts and PSC net interest reductions, decreased volumes by 21,000 barrels per day, while lower OPEC quota effects increased volumes by 31,000 barrels per day.", "Divestments reduced volumes by 1,000 barrels a day. Excluding the impact of entitlement effects, OPEC quotas and divestments, production was up 750,000 barrels per day or just over 20%, with the addition of XTO volumes and project ramp ups in Qatar partly offset by net field decline.", "Liquids production increased 86,000 barrels per day or nearly 4% from the third quarter of last year as project ramp ups in Qatar and the addition of XTO volumes more than offset net field decline. Gas volumes increased over 4 billion cubic feet per day or about 50% from the third quarter of 2009, driven by Qatar and XTO.", "Turning now to the sequential comparison and starting on Slide 17. Versus the second quarter of 2010, Upstream earnings increased about $130 million. Realizations increased earnings by $90 million, and stronger gas realizations in Europe and Qatar were partly offset by lower global crude oil realizations.", "Higher volume and mix effects increased earnings by $160 million, driven by lower maintenance activities and project ramp ups in Qatar and the addition of XTO. This was partly offset by a decline in seasonally lower natural gas demand in Europe. All other items decreased earnings by $120 million due primarily to unfavorable foreign exchange impacts.", "Moving to Slide 18. Oil equivalent volumes increased over 11% from the second quarter of 2010. Entitlement volume effects, including price and spend impacts and PSC net interest reductions, decreased volumes by 1,000 barrels per day, while lower OPEC quota effects increased volumes by 4,000 barrels per day.", "Divestments reduced volumes by 1,000 barrels per day. Excluding the impact of entitlement effects, OPEC quotas and divestments, production was up 455,000 barrels per day or just over 11%. Lower maintenance activities and project ramp ups in Qatar and the addition of XTO volumes more than offset decline in seasonally lower demand in Europe.", "Liquids production increased 96,000 barrels per day or just over 4%. And natural gas production increased over 2 billion cubic feet per day or about 22%. For further data on regional volumes, please refer to the press release and the IR supplement.", "Moving now to the Downstream and starting on Slide 20. In Refining, we continue to progress our multi-year program of global investments targeted at increasing the supply of lower sulfur motor fuels. We recently commissioned facilities at our Baytown, Texas and Baton Rouge, Louisiana refineries which will increase lower sulfur diesel supply in the United States. Our investments in hydrotreating facilities at our Antwerp, Belgium refinery are nearing completion. And finally, construction has commenced at our Sriracha, Thailand refinery to produce lower sulfur diesel and gasoline.", "As shown on Slide 21, earlier this month, our Lubricants business announced a multi-year sponsorship agreement with two-time NASCAR Sprint Cup Champion, Tony Stewart in Stewart-Haas Racing beginning in 2011. The new agreement allows Exxon Mobil to build on Mobil 1's official motor oil of NASCAR designation, and shows our ongoing commitment to NASCAR. It also illustrates Mobil 1's lubricant technology leadership, while supporting continued market growth. Mobil 1's association with NASCAR demonstrates Exxon Mobil's outstanding product performance under extreme driving conditions, and showcases the engine protection and fuel economy our technology delivers to both NASCAR drivers and race fans.", "Turning now to the Downstream operating results starting on Slide 22. Downstream earnings in the third quarter were $1.2 billion, up $840 million from the third quarter of 2009. Higher industry Refining margins partly offset by lower marketing margins, increased earnings by $300 million. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $150 million, including the benefits from our Refining optimization efforts. Other factors increased earnings by $390 million, mainly due to gains on asset sales and positive foreign exchange impacts.", "Moving to Slide 23. Sequentially, third quarter Downstream earnings decreased by $60 million. Lower margins decreased earnings by $390 million, reflecting weaker industry Refining and marketing margins. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $110 million, largely due to lower plant maintenance activity. Other factors increased earnings by $220 million, including favorable foreign exchange effects.", "Turning now to our Chemical business and starting on Slide 25. During the quarter, Exxon Mobil continued to progress the expansion of our integrated Chemical and Refining complex in Singapore. The expanded steam cracker will use Exxon Mobil's state-of-the-art proprietary technology to achieve substantial feed flexibility and increase energy efficiency.", "In addition, the expanded complex will produce a range of premium products to capture demand growth in Asia. The expansion will add over 2.5 million metric tons of capacity per year to the existing site. The anticipated mechanical completion and start-up activities will be phased in beginning later this year and will continue through 2011.", "Additionally, as we highlight on Slide 26, the third quarter included significant scheduled maintenance activities and plant improvements as more than 50% of our planned 2010 turnarounds worldwide were initiated this quarter. As an example, our facility in Kawasaki, Japan doubled its capability to produce lighter feedstocks, which will improve its competitiveness across broader market conditions. These planned maintenance activities play a pivotal role in our commitment to operational excellence.", "In addition, we continued to use these scheduled downtimes to incorporate improvements that help extend our leadership in areas such as energy efficiency and feedstock flexibility.", "Turning now to the Chemical operating results and starting on Slide 27. Third quarter Chemical earnings were $1.2 billion, up $350 million from the third quarter of 2009. Stronger margins improved earnings by $370 million, driven by continued strong feedstock advantage and higher realizations. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $50 million.", "Volumes increased 3%, reflecting the Fuji on startup, as well as continued recovery from the depressed demand levels seen in 2009.", "Other effects decreased earnings by a total of $70 million. While we manage our Downstream and Chemical businesses separately, we continue to capture benefits from the unique integration and optimization of these businesses. Our combined third quarter earnings were $2.4 billion, up $1.2 billion from third quarter 2009, reflecting the competitive advantage of our integrated Downstream and Chemical business model.", "Moving to Slide 28. Sequentially, third quarter Chemical earnings decreased by $140 million. Lower margins decreased earnings by $220 million, especially in Asia, with the start up of new industry capacity. Positive volume and mix effects increased earnings by $60 million. Other effects increased earnings by $20 million.", "Moving to Slide 30. Exxon Mobil's third quarter earnings and operating performance were strong and reflect the ability of our business model and company strengths to deliver superior results. We maintained a continuous focus on operational excellence and improving upon our industry-leading safety performance. We continued the successful execution of our long term investment plan, and we are moving forward on the flawless integration of XTO's world-class organization into our existing portfolio of high-quality assets.", "Our performance in the quarter includes the benefit of strong project and facility uptime in all of our business segments, providing further evidence of our disciplined and consistent approach across all of our business lines. With our unparalleled financial strength, Exxon Mobil remains well positioned to deliver on our plans.", "That concludes my prepared remarks. I would now be happy to take you're questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from  Mark Gilman with Benchmark.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "I wonder if you might be able to provide a total DD&A number for the quarter and the portion of that, that burdened the $150 million earnings contribution from XTO which you identified? And I have a follow-up.", "David Rosenthal", "Sure, Mark. We don't really disclose the details of our individual OpEx components, so I won't be able to provide that information today.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "It was a DD&A question, not OpEx. DD&A in the quarter overall and what portion of that burdened the $150 million earnings number that you identified for XTO.", "David Rosenthal", "If we look at the $150 million, I want to note that that was a positive number, a positive contribution for the quarter. But again, I don't have a detailed number to give you on the components of that, including DD&A.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "You referenced the Ellora merger, I wonder if you could talk a bit about costs and production impact?", "David Rosenthal", "In the quarter, that acquisition really had a de minimis impact on both production and costs. If you look at just quarter-on-quarter given the timing, it was de minimis. But we are looking forward to the long-term benefits of that acquisition, which as I mentioned, added about 46,000 acres to our portfolio on those plays.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "But no number for what the cost of the acquisition was?", "David Rosenthal", "No, I don't have that number for you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "I have a question on the buyback. I know it's been described in the past as the flywheel. But your increase in the fourth quarter to $5 billion, primarily given where you're trending almost $10 billion under your CapEx guidance on the midpoint that your uses of cash, we're likely to see operating cash in the fourth quarter. I mean, do we read anything to that? Is CapEx coming in lower? Or are making more of a statement here with your buyback?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, Evan, let me provide a little bit of clarity on both of those items. First, let's start with the buyback. There is no change. The buyback remains the flywheel of our cash flows. And as we look ahead in the fourth quarter and look at commodity prices and the business, we have made the decision to increase to the $5 billion level. I would say if we take a look at CapEx and start back at the outlook we gave everyone in March, we said we would spend about $28 billion this year. And although I don't have any firm outlook for the year, I would say if you take the $28 billion we mentioned and add in XTO, we'd be somewhere in the $30 billion to $31 billion for the year which should be consistent with that outlook. And I think we're pretty much on track to meet that. We've seen some upward pressure due to unfavorable ForEx. But over the course of the year, we'll see a lot of puts and takes. And again, I think we're pretty much on with our CapEx target that we had mentioned before and again, if you take into account the added activity from XTO.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "Right. I have a different question, if I could, second question on U.S. production. Your international volumes were really strong. The U.S. volumes in both the oil and gas a little bit lighter than we would've expected. Has the combined activity slowed due to the gas price environment or high grading opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico kind of decline impact? Can you maybe help me to think about North American volumes?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure. When we look at our total North American volumes, we have seen the impact of both our ongoing operations as well as the addition of XTO. I will tell you, everything is coming on as we expected. There's been no slowdown in activity. In fact, as we've mentioned before, activity has ramped up over the last several months. And any other offset would be just normal decline in maintenance across our facilities, but no special effects that I can mention.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Doug Terreson with ISI.", "Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc.", "I had a question on the Downstream, specifically asset sales and Forex benefits were pretty significant versus the year ago and Q2. And so I want to see if you could provide some segmentation and maybe geographical color on that figure. Meaning, of the $220 million sequential delta, I couldn't tell from your comments what was asset sales and what were Forex and where were they?", "David Rosenthal", "If you look at the Downstream earnings sequentially, in total, if you look at that other bar there, the $220 million that you mentioned, I can tell you the book it had is all Forex and that's the real factor in there.", "Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc.", "And also, you guys have been very successful with your exploration effort in the Philippines and while I realize it were somewhat early in the play, it also seems to be becoming meaningful. And so I just wanted to see if you could comment on market potential over there and also the next steps for development that Exxon has in that area?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, I would tell you, it's still a little early when we look at the size of that resource and the size of the acreage we have out there. Again, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, of the four wells we drilled, we have found gas in three of them and that's encouraging. But we're still in the evaluation stage and it'd be a little premature to give you any kind of a market outlook or production time.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Paul Cheng with Barclays capital.", "Paul Cheng", "Dave, you've mentioned about the asset sales already. Can you tell us then what is the actual asset sales gain in the quarter?", "David Rosenthal", "You're looking at Upstream, Downstream?", "Paul Cheng", "I guess both. I suppose that I mean Upstream is not having much of an asset sales gain and majority is in the Downstream.", "David Rosenthal", "If you're looking at the sequential earnings in the Downstream, if you look at...", "Paul Cheng", "Can you tell us then what is the actual asset sales gain. Is that just looking at, say, the change?", "David Rosenthal", "I really don't want to get into the details of the absolute values, Paul. But I can tell you that if we look at that quarter-on-quarter change in the other category, the $390 million, the bulk of that -- about half of that asset gain is quarter-on-quarter.", "Paul Cheng", "And how about in the Upstream?", "David Rosenthal", "If you look at our Upstream earnings on a quarter-to-quarter basis, I'll tell you, there's really not a big impact there. What we mainly saw there were some favorable tax items, but nothing else in that other bar really has to do with asset sales.", "Paul Cheng", "And Dave, do have any hedging gain or loss related to legacy hedging position of XTO in this quarter?", "David Rosenthal", "If we look at the hedging effects, when we look at those impacts going quarter-on-quarter, we do have an effect of about $50 million that we booked as a gain on those hedges as reflecting the decline in natural gas prices over the quarter.", "Paul Cheng", "A final one, if I could. Sakhalin-1, that's some news coming out from Russia talking about the possibility of the change in operatorship due to the increase in the budget, talking about a proposed news stop holding from the original budget. We understand that rumor rang over there. Can you give us any insight that have you actually been in discussion with the Russian authority? Or whether that's any true to some of the number being cited in the press?", "David Rosenthal", "Let me provide a little more color on the Sakhalin-1 project. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, of course, we have started up the Odoptu field, that's a very successful project, on time, on budget, excellent performance and really continues a string of successes as we've develop that project going back several years. As we look forward and we look at the budget, I can tell you that there have been no material changes to the scope of work for the Sakhalin-1 project. The consortium is still working within the original budget that was approved by the ASB. And as you would expect, we're working closely with the government and our partners to continue the successful development of that project and those discussions are ongoing. And everybody has the same objective in mind and that's to continue the success of that project and delivering the economic benefits that are derived for all of the stakeholders. So I wouldn't really comment on any rumors or speculation other than to say we continue to book a string of successes at Sakhalin, and look forward to continuing producing and developing that resource.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I wanted to circle back on a couple of things on the buybacks. Rex, a couple of weeks, I guess a month or so ago when we all sat around the table with him, he basically made a comment that you guys would have been prepared to do the XTO deal all cash. And obviously, you ultimately did it all stock I think on his prompting, if I remember it correctly. I guess my point is if you're prepared to do it all cash, how sustainable is this on rate of buybacks? Is this more about trying to basically buyback the stock you issued from XTO, in other words, it's not so much of a flywheel anymore? Can you just give some color in the context that we all relate this on?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, sure, Doug. Let me provide a little more clarity on that. There really is no change in our approach to the buybacks relative to any other use of our cash. What you're seeing in here and you saw in our results is we have had very strong net cash generation this year. Again, the business is performing well. You see the earnings increase and consistent with the way we've been using our cash and maintaining our flexibility and strong balance sheet. We find ourselves in a position to increase the buyback rate in the fourth quarter to $5 billion. But I wouldn't really try to draw any more conclusions with that or read anything into it other than we bought back $3 billion worth in the third quarter and we're going to buy back $5 billion in the fourth quarter.", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "If I could risk a double-barreled follow-up, if I may. Completely unrelated questions. The volumes, the moves run about sequentially in Africa and on Asia-Pac. Can you just give us some color as to what's going on there? And if I may circle back on Mark's earlier question, are you able to give us the cash flow contribution from XTO in the quarter?", "David Rosenthal", "Let me hit the volumes first. I think you mentioned specifically in Africa, we did see a decline in Africa on an OEB basis of about 35,000 barrels a day and that was in liquids, and that was really just some downtime that we had in Africa as well as normal decline. That bounces around if you look over at the sequential move in the third quarter versus the second quarter, you'll see our Africa liquids volumes are up 32 kbd, strong work programs over there and business performance. So just what I would consider the normal fluctuation quarter-to-quarter and what is a very large business for us. And then could you repeat your question on cash?", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Well, actually on Asia-Pac also because I was under the impression that Qatar was already up plateau last quarter. So if you could give some color on cash flow from XTO, please?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure. If you look at the Asia-Pac and Middle East volumes at our supplement they are up about 139,000 on liquids and another 1.9 billion on gas. That's quarter versus last quarter. If you look sequentially, we're up also about 60 kbd on the liquids and 819 million on the gas. And so yes, that's basically the projects ramping up in demand in contrary in Qatar. And we also saw some lowered scheduled maintenance. So I think the good news, Doug, is what I mentioned earlier. As we sit here today, all four of those mega trains are running at full capacity and the performance and up-time have been outstanding. And so the fluctuation that you see quarter-on-quarter sequentially is really just the continued good performance and a little lower maintenance. If we look at I think your other question was on cash flow from XTO? We never really disclose details of cash flows on any particular piece of our business or resource. And so I don't think we're in a position to offer that today.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Robert Kessler with Simmons & Company.", "Robert Kessler - Simmons & Company", "I want to know what your thoughts are with respect to the average utilization rate of that facility for about the next 6 months or so. Just looking at U.K., spot prices being quite a bit above the U.S. Henry Hub, it would seem advantageous to ship most of your cargoes to Europe instead of Golden Pass. But is there some factor to consider there, maybe in the contracts or otherwise that would result in a higher utilization rate at Golden Pass and when will it assume from the spot price differential?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure. Let's step back and start with the commissioning of the LNG terminal in Golden Pass. The commissioning has begun. We've got a commissioning cargo in there, the ship came in recently. That commissioning process is typically a two- to three-month effort, and we're focused on doing that and getting that done right and making sure all that hardware we put on the ground is working properly. Beyond that, it's a little too early to be talking about what's going to happen after that. The important thing for us is to get that thing up and running. And again as I mentioned, make sure that it works. But down the road as we've mentioned, quite often, we have tremendous flexibility in our ability to place cargoes out of  Qatar, around the world. We will always be looking for market opportunities that allow us to generate the maximum value based on those market conditions. And I would expect that strategy to continue going forward without being any specific on any one country or LNG receiving terminal. We got a great LNG business, very flexible, all of the assets are up and running. This will be the commissioning of our third LNG terminal, which kind of gets everything up and running. And we'll see the full benefit and value generated from the strategy that we will now have in place and finished up on. So we're really excited about this.", "Robert Kessler - Simmons & Company", "And then with respect to CapEx, you mentioned the inflationary effect of foreign exchange on capital expenditures for the quarter. Can you quantify that? And then I'm probably not going to get to far with the second component of the question, but any thoughts on the rate of change for total CapEx next year versus this year?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, if we look at the effect on CapEx this quarter from foreign exchange rates, it was about $400 million. And looking forward, I think the second part of your question is next year, really don't have any updated outlook for you. Obviously, we'll look forward to updating that and talking about that in the March Analyst Meeting.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Faisel Khan with Citigroup.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "I was wondering if you could give us a little more color on your LNG spot sales. Can you give us an idea in the quarter kind of where most of those cargoes were headed? Was it Arctic? Mostly were going to Asia where pricing seems to be a little bit higher than the second quarter.", "David Rosenthal", "I don't have any of the specific details by geography or by specific terminal. I can confirm that we are making spot sales in all of those regions that you mentioned and certainly taking advantage of market differentials and the ability to optimize and maximize the earnings out of those shipments. But in terms of getting specific, I really don't have those for you other than just to pick up on your comment. The ability to move cargoes around to take advantage of what various markets provide is a true strength of the business that we have in place, and we are certainly looking to maximize the value from that.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "In the North American gas market, can you give us an idea of where your rig count is right now? In North America, where you expect it to trend by the end of the year?", "David Rosenthal", "Are you talking on an industry rig count or...", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "No, yours. Exxon Mobil rig count.", "David Rosenthal", "I think we've got about 68, 70 rigs running today consistent with where we were in the past.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "And do you expect that to kind of remain the same going to the end of the year?", "David Rosenthal", "As we look out to the end of the year, I think essentially, plus or minus, you would expect to see that in that 70 category. I don't think there'll be any major changes up for now.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "Last question, just on the Upstream side. Was there any sort of underliftings or unscheduled maintenance or downtime across your Upstream portfolio that we may have missed?", "David Rosenthal", "If you look quarter on quarter, third quarter this year versus third quarter last year, we would have about 50 kbd in that category.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Jacques Rousseau with RBC Capital Markets.", "Jacques Rousseau - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "I just have a question on the balance sheet. It looks as though your debt declined from about $20 billion to $18 billion versus last quarter, and you mentioned in your comments that you retired buyback about $3 billion or so of XTO debt. So should we assume that the factor to tie this out of the increase to short-term debt?", "David Rosenthal", "We did take out about $1 billion of commercial paper during the quarter.", "Jacques Rousseau - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "And is this something you see as an option to help support the buyback program?", "David Rosenthal", "No, I wouldn't look at it in that regard. It's more if you step back and just look at our overall capital structure, look at the balance sheet, look at the opportunities that the market's offering us. And it was just opportune for us to step into the CP market this quarter and take out about $1 billion at very attractive rates. But I wouldn't read anymore into that other than that. It was just our normal ongoing management of the capital structure. And again, taking advantage of the what the market has on offer.", "Jacques Rousseau - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "You had mentioned before in terms of corporate costs, I believe, a range of $500 million to", "$700 million per quarter. Any thoughts on how that may change with the XTO deal?", "David Rosenthal", "No, and I would say, if you look back over the last many quarters, I know that number has jumped around a bit. But I would confirm that on an ongoing basis, you would expect to see our corporate thin numbers to come in anywhere in that $500 million to", "$700 million range. But I don't have any other guidance. But yes, $500 million to $700 million is what we would expect going forward.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Just another way perhaps of getting at the cash flow numbers, could you just give a total group DD&A? I know we'll get them in the Q next week, but if you just have the group DD&A on the cash flow statement and any change in working capital that would be helpful.", "David Rosenthal", "Sure, if we look at the total DD&A for the company in the third quarter of '10, it was $3.9 billion and that was up $1 billion from the three quarter of '09.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And any changes in working capital?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, if we look quarter-on-quarter, it was about $1  billion related to a change in accrued payables positive.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And then just moving to exploration. Obviously, you have a Black Sea well. I think it was meant to complete in Q3, where are we on that? Are we expecting results? Or have you got some results you could share? It was a partner well, actually.", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, that was a partner well. We did complete that well in the third quarter. We did expensed that well. However, we did see hydrocarbon shows, which did provide evidence of a working hydrocarbon system. And we are continuing to further evaluate the data from that well which as you would expect, will help us on our upcoming exploration program. But yes, we are finished with that well.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "On the U.S. liquids, you have 357 in Q2 which was down a bit against Q1 because of maintenance in the offshore Gulf of Mexico. Obviously, you bounced back a little bit perhaps not as much as you would have thought with XTO. Is there still some maintenance impact in the U.S. liquids?", "David Rosenthal", "Well, if you look at our U.S. liquids, we did get a nice uplift of course on XTO, but that was partly offset by decline across the portfolio.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "So nothing unusual?", "David Rosenthal", "No, nothing unusual.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated", "David, I was trying to get a quick update on BM-S-22 in Brazil. As I understand it, they was originally going to spud I believe it was this month, but that got pushed back a month or two. I was trying to get an update on what's going on out there?", "David Rosenthal", "If you look at that third well, I think we have said all along we were expecting to spud that in the fourth quarter. It looks like we're still on track to do that. We expect to begin that operation in December.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated", "So the rig is secured and everything is ready to go for December?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, we are on schedule for a December start.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated", "And the second question I had for you, one of your peers yesterday announced that they are shutting in some North American natural gas with the idea of selling those volumes down the road once prices improve. I'm just curious, is Exxon considering anything like that?", "David Rosenthal", "What I can tell you if we're looking at that business, we have not shut in any gas wells.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated", "So activities continues to ramp, as you suggested earlier, and no shut in volumes?", "David Rosenthal", "Activity continues on the pace that we've been running and we have not shut in any wells.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.", "Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates", "Just a question about Greenland. I think you guys participated in one of the recent licensing rounds. Can you give us a sense of when you might begin exploration there?", "David Rosenthal", "If we look at our portfolio and particularly hone in on Greenland, you're right, we do have some acreage in the Greenland area. But I really can't give you a specific timeframe in terms of when specific activities might happen. We are evaluating on an ongoing basis some seismic work that we've done and interpreting that. But I don't have a specific date, for example, if you are looking at wells or anything. Still early days in Greenland a lot of acreage, a lot to analyze and I would really say we're still in the evaluation phase there.", "Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates", "And follow-up, if I may, on XTO. Relative to June 26, is the rig count on the legacy XTO properties kind of up, down or flattish?", "David Rosenthal", "I think if you were to take a starting point being the end of June, it's about flat where we are today, plus or minus a rig or two, but we we're essentially flat.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG", "David, can I just read around a bit more in the hedging subject? Did you say that it was a $50 million gain that you got?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG", "Is that the realized gain or it's just that it's less than you would think it would be given the position that we know XTO is in?", "David Rosenthal", "Look, Paul, that's an excellent question and without trying to get too detailed in what can be some complicated accounting. As you know, we had mark-to-market all of those hedges at the acquisition. And on that basis, of what the contracts were hedged at and what the strip was at the time, at those sales had proceeded along those lines, the difference between the hedged price and the price that we have had marked that at, that would have gone into cash flow and still does. What you did see across the quarter is that the gas price decline and therefore, it was below the price that we actually restated those hedges out of the quarter and that small piece does flow into earnings. So the bigger piece goes into cash flows, doesn't go into earnings. And the smaller piece associated with the decline in prices relative to the end of June strip did go into earnings and that was about $50 million.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG", "And these hedge positions, I think you've stated you will unwind? What's the status of that now?", "David Rosenthal", "For the schedule that you've seen publicly, we're going to let those unwind as time goes on.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG", "I guess my point was you're not doing anything other than just letting them roll?", "David Rosenthal", "No change in how we're going to approach this business.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG", "And the other one for me, I'm not sure if you'll give me this, but could you give us your capital employed on September 30 as broken down by division?", "David Rosenthal", "No, Paul, I don't have the capital employed in total or broken down by division right now.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG", "But there is a number here on Page 9 of the release which is the capital employed at September 30, right?", "David Rosenthal", "I mean, yes, I'm sorry, I don't have any of the division breakdowns for you.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Jason Gammel with Macquarie.", "Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research", "David, I just have a couple of questions on the drilling schedule. First of all, with the moratorium within the Gulf of Mexico, have you given any consideration as to when you might permit another well in the Gulf? When you'll be active in drilling again? And if there are further opportunities to pickup acreage given what are potentially some big increases in the cost structure there?", "David Rosenthal", "Let's go back and talk a little bit about the moratorium. First thing I'd like to say is that we are pleased that the government is recognizing the industry's commitment to enhance safety standards and response capability in lifting the moratorium. As you would expect, we are continuing to review the details of the announcement, the changes in the rules and standards that we all have to abide by. And we're in the process of analyzing that and looking at what impacts that might have on us. I can tell you as we look forward in the near term, you'll recall that at the time of the moratorium, we were preparing to drill our next Hadrian well in our discovery in the Gulf of Mexico. And we are planning to submit in the near term, our revised permit application in order to get that drill underway.", "Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research", "Are you seeing any opportunities to far more incremental drilling activities, David?", "David Rosenthal", "Without being specific certainly and mention anything individually, we are always looking at opportunities that are out there. Oftentimes, there are changes in the market and changes in the business environment that do generate opportunities for us. But I would say nothing special or different, just doing what we always do which is looking at what's out there, what's on offer. We can find a way to add value to something. We certainly look at it seriously, but that's an ongoing business for us.", "Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research", "If I could just turn to the Black Sea briefly, I believe you contracted a rig to move into the Black Sea. Can you talk about when you might be able to start the first well there and what your plan for drilling in terms of timing and number of wells would be?", "David Rosenthal", "I think as we've mentioned before, we do have a new build rig that's going to be heading into the Black Sea to drill our acreage position there. As we look forward to next year, I think you would expect to see us being able to spud that first well sometime in the first half of 2011.", "Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research", "And do you think you'll keep that rig in the Black Sea for a while, David or maybe farm our some slots to other operators there?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, we certainly plan to keep that rig in the Black Sea for quite a while. I wouldn't want to talk about who's going to utilize, what percentage of it, but yes, it will be in there.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Mark Gilman with Benchmark.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "David, as the activity in Iraq where it's going to ramp up, can you help us with some guidance as to how you will report your activity and volumes there?", "David Rosenthal", "Of course, it's a little early there in the project. As I mentioned, we have met our six-month milestones. We have awarded some contracts to get the work going, but as that ramp up progresses, we would certainly as we head up to our production targets, we would certainly expect to report the volumes as they're produced next year. And so I don't think there's anything out of the ordinary there.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "So you'll report production prior to the time you were in remuneration piece?", "David Rosenthal", "Mark, I'm not sure about the exact details in terms of the timing. But certainly, as we ramp up production and get to our initial production targets per the product, we'll be reporting production volumes.", "Operator", "We'll take our last question from Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.", "Paul Cheng", "One, I assume you don't have much of an inventory gain or loss in the quarter, do you?", "David Rosenthal", "No, we didn't see much of an inventory gain or loss as a whole in the quarter.", "Paul Cheng", "And secondly, going back to Iraq, if we assume that -- I just want to understand from a timeline standpoint from the time that you will be able to actually start doing the work over activity and drilling activity in Iraq, how long it would take before we will start to see you would be able to get the production up to the 10% range?", "David Rosenthal", "Paul, I don't have a specific timeframe to give you. We will meet any specific production targets. As you know, this is a long-term effort that we have underway. I can tell you that per our schedule and our milestones, what we were expecting things proceeding on track. We do things have underway, as I mentioned, contracts led. We would expect to reach our initial production targets sometime in 2011. But in terms of any more specific timing other than that, I really couldn't give you a more specific date.", "Paul Cheng", "Dave, can you tell us whether you actually now start drilling in the field or you're just doing a slight preparation?", "David Rosenthal", "Well, we got a number of activities that are underway in the field, some of which I mentioned in my remarks starting initially of course with a lot of well work over his. And are proceeding to drilling but as we sit here today, we're really working on the work over and tie-ins and the major drilling efforts are still to come.", "David Rosenthal", "I want to thank everybody for their time today and the questions and appreciate the time in the call.", "Operator", "That does conclude today's conference.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Henry Hubble. Please go ahead, sir.", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to ExxonMobile's teleconference and Webcast on our third quarter 2006 financial and operating results. As you are aware from this mornings press release, we had another strong quarter as our long standing commitments to the integrity of our operations, disciplined investment approach, and our integrated business model continued to position the Company to benefit from robust industry conditions.", "At this time I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement. Please note the estimates, plans, and projections are forward-looking statements. Actual results including resource recoveries, volume growth, and project plans and outcomes could differ materially due to factors I'll discuss and factors noted in our SEC files. Please see factors affecting future results and the Form 8-K we furnished this morning which are available through the investor information section of our website. Please also see the frequently used terms. The supplement to this morning\u2019s 8-K and the 2005 financial and operating review on our website. This material defines certain financial and operating terms I'll use today, shows ExxonMobile's net interest in specific projects, and includes information required by SEC Regulation G.", "Now I'm pleased to turn your attention to the specific results. ExxonMobile's third quarter net income and normalized earnings were $10.5 billion, or $1.77 per share. This was a record quarter for normalized earnings, and represents an increase of $2.2 billion over the third quarter 2005 on the same basis. Normalized earnings per share increased by 34% over the third quarter last year reflecting the strong earnings performance and also the benefits of the share repurchase program. Before I discuss the specific business results, I'd like to highlight some of the significant milestones we achieved since our last earnings call. Many of which are helping to bring new supply to the market.", "In the upstream we commissioned the export system and completed loading of first oil from the multi phase Sakhalin-1 project at the newly constructed De-Kastri terminal. Oil production should ramp up to an estimated peek rate of approximately 250,000 barrels a day around the end of the year following line out of the onshore processing facility and additional well tie-ins. We continue to be pleased with the phase one project performance and are pursuing future phases.", "In another recent milestone, we started production at Erha North, a deepwater development located offshore Nigeria. This is a satellite to the Erha development which came online earlier this year. Erha North started production within 30 months of discovery, setting a Nigeria deepwater record. Both Erha and Erha North facilities were constructed within budget and further demonstrate ExxonMobile's operational excellence, project execution, and deepwater expertise. Current production from the combined facilities is above expectations at 220,000 barrels a day.", "Also during this quarter, Golden Pass LNG LLC awarded a contract to begin engineering procurement and construction of the facilities near Sabine Pass, Texas. These facilities have capacity to process 15.6 million tons per year of LNG and are part of the multibillion dollar supply chain necessary to deliver LNG from Qatar to the United States. It's expected that the Ras Laffan 3 and Qatargas III projects which will produce and process natural gas from Qatar's offshore North field will provide the primary supply for the terminal. Construction of the Golden Pass terminal is another important step in supplying natural gas to customers along the Gulf Coast and other U.S. Markets.", "During the quarter, drilling began in one of our Orphan basin exploration blocks. The well is located about 250 miles off the coast of St. John's new found land in 8,000 feet of water. This is the first well to be drilled in the basin and carries significant risk and reward potential. Operations are expected to carry through until year-end.", "In the downstream, we successfully completed the transition of our facilities to meet new, U.S, Ultra low sulfur diesel requirement which reduce on road diesel sulfur by 97%. In addition to near term benefits, this ultra low sulfur fuel allows for the use of advanced emissions reduction technologies, which will lead to a significant reduction in diesel vehicle emissions as the fleet turns over. ExxonMobile's worldwide effort to reduce sulfur content of diesel and gasoline fuels represents a total investment of $3.5 billion and is an important part of our continuing efforts to reduce vehicle emissions.", "We were pleased to announce in August that our high performing synthetic oil, Mobil 1, was elected as the factory and service fuel motor oil for the new 2007 Acura RDX Luxury SUV. Mobil 1 received the highest rating of all oils tested, including other synthetics, and was selected on it's ability to meet the demands of a high performance turbo charge engine. Mobil 1 continues to lead the industry with over 30 automotive manufacture endorsements. Our advanced technology allows us to consistently meet customer requirements for high quality products and provides a competitive advantage.", "In keeping with our process of continuously and rigorously assessing our global portfolio of businesses, we recently announced the sale of a number of our fuels and lubes business in Africa. These transactions include a network of about 300 service stations and the associated supply and distribution facilities. These transactions are subject to the approval of relevant authorities in multiple countries, therefore completion time will vary from one country to another.", "I'd now like to comment on two significant chemical milestones. Earlier this month, we announced the signing of a heads of agreement with Qatar Petroleum to progress feasibility studies for a proposed $3 billion world scale petrochemical complex in Ras Laffan industrial city. The project would use feedstock from gas development projects in Qatar's North field and utilize ExxonMobile proprietary steam cracking furnace and polyethylene technologies to create premier products for customers in Asia and Europe. The successful partnership between ExxonMobile and Qatar Petroleum continues with this proposed project as we further expand the use of North field gas. Start up of the proposed petrochemical complex is estimated in 2012.", "In September, we announced plans to build a new chemical facility at our Baton Rouge, Louisiana complex, to produce specialty compounded products. This plant will be able to produce a broad spectrum of commercial compounded products, including ExxonMobile chemicals, performance polyolefin grades, Santoprene thermoplastic elastomers and other specialty elastomers. The new facility is expected to start up in mid 2007 and is part of a Company's global strategy and commitment to provide engineered thermoplastic materials to the automotive and consumer products industries.", "Turning now to the business line results. I'd ask you to also please refer to the earnings reconciliation in the IR supplement. Upstream normalized earnings in the third quarter were $6.5 billion. This represents an increase of about $760 million versus the third quarter of 2005. Upstream earnings per barrel were also strong at $17.61 per barrel. Higher realizations and volumes accounted for the increase in earnings from the third quarter of 2005. Net other items were essentially unchanged.", "Worldwide crude sales realizations were $65.14 per barrel, up $7.12 from the third quarter of 2005. Worldwide natural gas realizations were also improved. Oil equivalent volumes increased 7% with increases in Africa and the Middle East more than offsetting natural field declines in North America and Europe.", "Excluding the impact of divestments and entitlement effects, production increased by about 10%. Liquids production increased nearly 200,000 barrels per day or 8% versus the same quarter last year. Excluding the impact of divestments and entitlement effects, liquids production increased by 12%. The Erha, Bonga, East Area and Kizomba B start ups as well as the addition of Upper Zakum were the bigger sources of the additional liquids volumes.", "Gas volumes increased by approximately 450 million cubic feet per day or about 6% versus the third quarter of 2005. Higher production from the 2005 start ups of Ross Gas Train 4 and Al Khaleej in Qatar and the absence of 2005 hurricane impacts was partly offset by natural field decline in North America and Europe.", "Turning to the sequential comparison, upstream earnings decreased by about $640 million versus the second quarter of 2006. Lower realizations, normal seasonal declines in natural gas sales, lower asset sales, and negative tax effects were the primary reasons for the decrease. Liquids production was down 2% from the second quarter of 2006, including the impact of unplanned down time at Prudhoe Bay. Natural gas production was down about 7% due to normal seasonal declines in Europe. For further data on regional volumes, please refer to the press release and IR supplement.", "Now, turning to the downstream. Third Quarter downstream normalized earnings were a record $2.7 billion, up $610 million over the third quarter of 2005. The increase was driven by stronger marketing margins, partially offset by lower refining margins. The volume mix effect was a negative 240 million primarily due to higher refinery turnaround and maintenance activity partially offset by the absence of hurricane impacts.", "Other factors, increased earnings by $140 million primarily due to positive tax effects. Sequentially, downstream earnings increased by approximately $250 million with increased refinery throughput and other effects more than offsetting lower refinery margins.", "In total, margin impacts reduced earnings by $240 million compared to the second quarter. Refining margins were lower by $800 million; however this impact was largely offset by improved marketing margins. Volume mix effects were positive $210 million due to lower refining turnaround activity. Other factors improved earnings by $285 million with lower operating costs consistent with the reduction in refining turnaround activity combined with positive tax effects.", "Turning now to the chemical results. Third quarter normalized earnings were $1.35 billion, up $880 million versus the third quarter of 2005. Strong margins across all major business lines improved earnings by $820 million with higher realizations, out pacing increased feedstock cost. Volumes were slightly lower reflecting short-term demand effects.", "Year-to-date volumes are essentially flat with 2005. Earnings also benefited from positive tax effects. Sequentially, chemical earnings increased by about $510 million driven by higher margins. The impact of slightly reduced volumes following a robust second quarter was partially offset by lower operating costs. We continue to see strengthen our chemical business, as our diverse portfolio, broad geographic coverage, and integration capabilities result in strong competitive advantage and industry leading performance.", "Turning now to the corporate and financing segment. Corporate and financing expenses of about $100 million were up from the third quarter of 2005, primarily due to tax impacts partially offset by higher interest income. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 44%. Our cash balance was $37 billion and debt was $8.6 billion at the end of the third quarter. The corporation distributed a total of $8.9 billion to shareholders in the third quarter through dividends and share repurchases to reduce shares outstanding, an increase of 30% or $2.1 billion versus the third quarter of 2005.", "During the third quarter, ExxonMobile purchased $7 billion of shares in excess of dilution. There by reducing the number of shares outstanding by 1.9%. Since the beginning of 2005 our quarterly share repurchase program has increased almost threefold which further demonstrates our ongoing commitment to return cash to shareholders.", "CapEx in the third quarter was $5.1 billion up almost $650 million from the third quarter of 2005, primarily due to planned upstream activity. Our year-to-date CapEx was $14.8 billion, approximately $2.4 billion higher than through the third quarter of 2005. Our full year outlook for CapEx remains unchanged at approximately $28 billion. ", "That concludes my prepared remarks and I'd now be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Hubble. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Doug Terreson of Morgan Stanley.", "Doug Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Good morning and congratulations on your results.", "Henry Hubble", "Thanks, Doug.", "Doug Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "In the downstream, both refinery throughput and petroleum product sales seem to be flat or down in relation to the year ago period both for Q3 and the first nine months of the year, and on this point I wanted to see if there were a few specific factors that helped to explain these trends and if not, any additional color on the turnaround and maintenance items that you highlighted would be appreciated.", "Henry Hubble", "Yeah. I mean, if you look at just the overall volumes, the throughput in the period, we were down from -- let me just pull the number here -- yeah, we were essentially flat across the period, and then what you saw in the volume effect that's there, basically that's turnarounds and that's essentially a mix of turnarounds because what you see in the throughput numbers is basically a distillation, we were tracking distillation there. And that was primarily crude, well or crude is down in the third quarter of last year and what you're seeing now in the relative comparison is more upgrading units.", "Doug Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Okay.", "Henry Hubble", "So that was impact there.", "Doug Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Okay that makes sense, and also, in the upstream in Alaska and Indonesia on Point Thompson and Natuna, there have been a decent amount of commentary in the press regarding possible changes in your position in those areas, and so I wanted to see if there was an update on the status of those two developments?", "Henry Hubble", "Well, if you look at Cepu, we continue to work with, work on basically with the government there to look to accelerate the project, and so we're continuing to work with them on the development plan there, and then if you look at Natuna, we're committed to develop Natuna. Obviously, it's a challenging resource.", "Doug Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Sure. ", "Henry Hubble", "Very high CO2 contents there, but you have been hearing a lot in the press, and all I would say is we're working to meet all of our obligations and we assume and expect that the government will be doing the same thing, and frankly, we're engaged in a discussion with the government right now to resolve those issues around the PSA.", "Doug Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Great. Thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to Mark Flannery of Credit Suisse.", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Yeah, hi, Henry. I have a question on drilling rig coverage.", "Henry Hubble", "Yes.", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "We've been picking up some news in the last few days that you guys have been involved and in fact have chartered the West Polaris drilling rig for delivery in the second quarter 2008. I wondered, does this represent anything of a change in your approach to rig coverage? I noticed McGill earlier this year was talking about how you were happy to be at a relatively low level of offshore rig coverage for \u201808 and \u201809. Are you changing your mind on this?", "Henry Hubble", "No. We continue to, we have a mix of coverage that we line up. There's really no change in our views in the rig situation, but as we move forward, we're going to continue to cover a specific requirements. We've got adequate coverage on our projects and basically, we've got rigs for the firm prospects that we have.", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "And could you maybe give us an idea of what kind of percentage coverage you have in \u201808 and \u201809 already for just for offshore rigs?", "Henry Hubble", "No. That gets into a little more competitive information than I want to get out here.", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Thank you.", "Henry Hubble", "Yup.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to Jennifer Rowland of JP Morgan.", "Jennifer Rowland - JP Morgan", "Thanks. I was wondering if you could break out a little bit the refining versus the marketing on a sequential and also year-over-year basis?", "Henry Hubble", "Yeah. If you look at the big effects there were in margins in the sequential and the year-over-year, and if you look at -- first the sequential numbers, refining margins were down about $800 million and the marketing margins partially offset that to bring us to the 240, and what that reflects, you saw a big impact on refining margins in the period or the period comparison basically as inventories built and there was softness in those refining margins and that sequential comparison.", "Then if you look at the year-on-year, there was some, there we saw even larger impact or increase on the marketing margins so it was almost, in fact it was all of that increase that we saw, and there, you have again when you comparing the last quarter, we had the hurricane impacts in that period, so you saw actually decrease in the marketing margins during that timeframe and in this period with some of the lag effects that we see as crude prices and commodity prices drop, we had higher margins in this period.", "Jennifer Rowland - JP Morgan", "Okay, and then you mentioned there was some tax effects in both -- ", "Henry Hubble", "Yeah.", "Jennifer Rowland - JP Morgan", "Upstream and downstream on a sequential basis. Can you just break that out from the other bar?", "Henry Hubble", "Yeah. Let me just step back for just a little bit more on the margins because I'll mention, in the refining side, part of the reason we didn't see as much downturn in the third quarter margins on refining is also related to our integration with lubes. We have a lot of lubes refining capacity and that actually was positive year-on-year, so it was, so that was something else that helped improve our results there, and then on the tax side, there really, if you look at that other column, there really isn't a significant story there. There's a lot of minor changes up and down, but the ones I mentioned were the biggest effects and they are basically non-U.S. Tax items like Europe and Asia Pacific.", "Jennifer Rowland - JP Morgan", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Henry Hubble", "Yup.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Hi, Henry.", "Henry Hubble", "Hi, Paul.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "If we could continue on the same theme, Henry, firstly on the downstream, the 800 down in refining margin and the 600 up in marketing, could you break that out regionally or at least between the U.S. and non-U.S?", "Henry Hubble", "Yeah. If you look at the refining margins in the U.S, They were down about 500 million overseas about 300.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Great. That answers it. On the volume side if we revert to that now, those look a bit weak but you referenced I think some seasonal impacts on the chemical side. If I could slightly switch to my downstream chemicals but also in the oil markets you said that -- I think the disposals were a key reason for weakness in volumes on that?", "Henry Hubble", "Well, on the marketing margins, yeah. And we had divestments there that were the biggest impact on our product, our drop off in product sales -- ", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Do you have a number on that, Henry? And where? It wasn't U.S. I guess, was it?", "Henry Hubble", "Yeah. Let me, well the biggest, we have U.S, we continue to high grade the network there and of course we have the Africa piece, but that's going on around the circuit, you've got some in Africa, you\u2019ve got some in Europe so we're high grading around in our network continually.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "You've broken out what your volumes would have been upstream if it hadn't been for disposal. Could you give us a guess of how good volumes or what kind of demand strength you would have seen had it not been for the sales you had done in the petroleum product side?", "Henry Hubble", "Yeah. You would have been up a percent or so.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, great. And on the chemical side, I think you said was it seasonal effects?", "Henry Hubble", "Yeah, well, on the chemical side, you have some of these what we almost call mini cycles in the chemicals business and it has a lot to do, the volumes that you see there have a lot to do with peoples expectation on where prices are going, so what you see is when prices, the feedstock prices start dropping rapidly, people will V-stock and slowdown their purchases waiting for that to be reflected into product prices, and so you'll see that whenever you have a big change in the commodity price.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, great. And if I could have one more, please, on taxes, you had, sorry, upstream taxes, you had said last quarter that the North Sea impact would be around $0.01 to $0.02 I believe?", "Henry Hubble", "That's right.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "And is that, I mean does that actually happened dare I ask and secondly could you quantify Alaska and any other impacts globally on the upstream side that might be within these numbers?", "Henry Hubble", "Well you\u2019ve got the big ones. Those were the big impacts and the UK increase, it came in about where we thought it would, about in the middle of that range, so and then Alaska was a bit less than that.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Henry, I'll leave it there. Thank you.", "Henry Hubble", "Very good.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to Doug Leggate of Citigroup.", " Doug Leggate \u2013 Citigroup", "Thank you, good morning Henry. I guess this is going to be something of a theme. The tax situation, if you look at your tax rate, it looked to be a little low or something, lower than recent quarters. Was that just the mix effect because of the heavier downstream contribution?", "Henry Hubble", "Well, the tax rate actually was about flat. I mean it was 44%, I think it was the same thing versus second quarter and actually up some versus last year.", " Doug Leggate \u2013 Citigroup", "Yeah, I'm talking sequentially.", "Henry Hubble", "Yeah, so it was flat. It was basically flat.", " Doug Leggate \u2013 Citigroup", "I guess -- my question is that some of your competitors only reported included some data charges for the first half of the year both UK, Alaska and one or two other things. Are you able to quantify if you did the same thing and to what extent it was?", "Henry Hubble", "Well, I mean, we report the effects, and these are net effects that we're reporting here, so in the UK, that's a net effect, and it's complex and I can't really get into all of the forward and backward pieces on it but they are net effects.", " Doug Leggate \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay and my second question is really just on production. There's actually two parts of this if you don't mind both very simple I'm afraid.", "Henry Hubble", "Yeah.", " Doug Leggate \u2013 Citigroup", "In terms of the pricing effects I just wanted to make sure my understanding is right on this. The average oil price in Q3 last year was about $7 below what it was this year.", "Henry Hubble", "Yes.", " Doug Leggate \u2013 Citigroup", "So are you saying if we hit the (inaudible) for $63 level for talking sake that your volumes would go up by around 3%?", "Henry Hubble", "Well, no. I mean, what we have said when we've looked at the entitlement effects has been more like a 1% kind of a number.", " Doug Leggate \u2013 Citigroup", "That balances disposals?", "Henry Hubble", "Yeah, and then you look there's disposals in there but if you look at the overall volume, volume impacts, it's about the balance was entitlements, almost 2% there.", " Doug Leggate \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay and I guess the second part very simply to that question is obviously OPEC cuts, have you seen anything in terms of requests and so on just in your business?", "Henry Hubble", "Yeah. I mean, the OPEC effects for us will be small. Now, we do see, we do see on a production side, but you do see things in supply as crude is being cut back, we are seeing changes in mix, generally comes out of heavy grades and so we see some of that. ", " Doug Leggate \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay, that's great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to Neil McMahon of Bernstein.", "Neil McMahon \u2013 Bernstein", "Two questions. One is when you look at the sort of basic data you've given us for cash flow and your earnings press release, you've got $800 million for sales of subsidiaries investments and plant property and equipment. I wonder if you could break that down into how much of that was actual divestments and where they were in terms of upstream, downstream chemicals, other?", "Henry Hubble", "Yeah. I mean the biggest piece was Carson Creek, you know, we did have some upstream sales but we\u2019re really -- I can't get into the break down of each of these things. I can tell you though, if you look at the quarter-on-quarter comparison though and for the upstream earnings, I mean, they netted out. We didn't really have any other effects and that was basically the impacts that I described on the tax side with UK and Alaska tax offsetting some higher asset sales in the biggest piece of that was Carson Creek.", "Neil McMahon \u2013 Bernstein", "But you would say that $800 million in your cash flow statement would be divestments?", "Henry Hubble", "Different divestments, yes. I mean, it's upstream and downstream mix.", "Neil McMahon \u2013 Bernstein", "Great. Just a second question on U.S. gas, you had a decline in volumes sequentially. Two parts: One, just wondering if that was due to divestments alone and secondly, are you seeing any changes in activity in the Piceance basin in terms of rig availability or indeed are you taking any actions yourself to change activities given where the natural gas price has been this year?", "Henry Hubble", "Yeah. As you're looking at the year-on-year gas production for the upstream?", "Neil McMahon \u2013 Bernstein", "I believe so.", "Henry Hubble", "Yeah, okay, so I mean one of the big impacts there is just the absence of the hurricanes, so that probably the biggest single impact to decrease that number and of course we're continuing to move Piceance forward and it's moving ahead according to plans there, but in terms of actual volume contribution at this point it's relatively small.", "Neil McMahon \u2013 Bernstein", "Okay, but you're not changing any of your activities going forward?", "Henry Hubble", "In terms of from a price outlook?", "Neil McMahon \u2013 Bernstein", "Yup.", "Henry Hubble", "No, our plans are based on long term outlooks and the competitiveness of the projects that we have and so it's not impacted by near term price.", "Neil McMahon \u2013 Bernstein", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to Nikki Decker of Bear Stearns.", "Nikki Decker - Bear Stearns", "Good morning, Henry.", "Henry Hubble", "Hi, Nikki.", "Nikki Decker - Bear Stearns", "Two questions on Saco if I could. First of all, I think you were due to start an inspection process by the natural resources ministry. Just wondering what we might expect and if there was anything potentially significant that could come out of that and secondly, we seen some press reports that you've reached a preliminary agreement on gas sales. Maybe you could comment on that.", "Henry Hubble", "Yeah, I guess first on the Saco in piece, the inspection hasn't started but there's been ongoing interactions with government officials all the way through this, so it's not like there's a lot of things, or still it's going to be more closing things out and we're not expecting any real issues and as you see, we started up the facilities and have made the first exports and in fact I think the next vessel is due to arrive either today or tomorrow. So, that continues to move ahead. And we're pleased with the progress.", "Nikki Decker - Bear Stearns", "And on gas sales agreement?", "Henry Hubble", "Yeah. Well, we basically signed an HOA with CNPC and that basically, you know, our intent is to work forward to an agreement there and there are also discussions as you might guess with gas prom about how to export that.", "Nikki Decker - Bear Stearns", "Okay, can you give us any color on the term size, anything?", "Henry Hubble", "No. We haven't -- all of that is to be defined yet in terms of the specific agreement.", "Nikki Decker - Bear Stearns", "Thank you, Henry.", "Henry Hubble", "Yup.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to John Herrlin of Merrill Lynch.", "John Herrlin - Merrill Lynch", "Yeah, hi Henry. Last quarter, Erha was running above boiler plate and now you put it in the satellite facility. Is this going to be constrained, is it going to be flowing at pretty high rates for a long time?", "Henry Hubble", "Well, as I said, it's up at the 220,000 barrels a day now and that's above what we were originally expecting, and so we'll see, but these do decline overtime and most of these fields have, they will maintain a peak for a certain period and then you'll see declines, but we feel real good about that project. It's done very, very well.", "John Herrlin - Merrill Lynch", "Understood. I was just trying to get a sense of how the satellite was.", "Henry Hubble", "I really can't give you anything right now. It's performing consistent and above our expectations.", "John Herrlin - Merrill Lynch", "Super. Next one for me with golden pass, when do you expect to receive LNG?", "Henry Hubble", "Well, in the completion date, I don't know if I have that right at my finger tips here. It's 2008.", "John Herrlin - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, and then lastly for me, with the Orphan basin you said you'll TD this one at the end of the year. Does that then mean a pause, should we expect an announcement, or what will you do?", "Henry Hubble", "Let me just back up on the completion of that looking around the 2009 is for the -- is when we'll have the first receipts there.", "John Herrlin - Merrill Lynch", "End of 2009 or middle?", "Henry Hubble", "No. I don't have anything more specific than that. And then Orphan, it's a tight hole so I don't have any data. I can share it's drilling and then obviously, it's one that's high risk and potentially high reward but we have a number of those kinds of prospects that we're working on.", "John Herrlin - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, Henry.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to Paul Cheng of Lehman Brothers.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Hi, Henry.", "Henry Hubble", "Hi, Paul. How are you?", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Very good. Sorry to have to bug you on this one. On the tax and office sales, let me try to understand a little bit better. In your supplemental presentation, you indicated that other sequentially that lead to 190 million lower earnings. If I recall correctly, in the second quarter, you have asset sales gain of about $340 million and the benefit from the Canadian tax law change of $200 million. So that's about $540 million and that the higher UK tax in Alaska based on what you just mentioned is roughly about 170 to 180 million, so that means that if this item, the $190 million lower earnings is assumed that mainly related to asset sales and tax changes, so does that mean that on the absolute dollar term, your third quarter, you have a benefit on those two items to the tune of about $5 to $600 million?", "Henry Hubble", "I'm not following. I think we're going to have to take that one off line because I'm not sure, I can't follow all of the numbers you were going through there, Paul.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Okay.", "Henry Hubble", "I think we would be better off to take that offline.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "I will do so. Second question, wondering if you have been informed or by order by either your suppliers such as Saudi Arabia to have a lower location or that the shipment to you for November or by Nigeria that saying that you need to trim your production already?", "Henry Hubble", "Well, Saudi Arabia, that's a supply, my comments there were on a supply side and so and then for anything else, it's basically a dialogue with those countries on what they are going to actually do and that's ongoing, so there's nothing I have to report there at this point. Like I said on the supply side, we have contracts and they will ship the great mix and that kind of stuff.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "I understand, but Henry, I guess my question is that did they officially inform you guys of trimming your location?", "Henry Hubble", "Yeah. I mean, right now, there's plenty of crude supply out there. I'm not sure what you're going at in terms of we don't really have any, as I mentioned, there's no indication on limitation on the amount of oil. There's plenty of oil out there so we've got all of our, we're a big buyer of crude. We don't have any trouble covering that, and so \u2013 and then as I said before, in terms of our production side of it, it's very small, if anything.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. That's fine. Can I have just one final quick question? I think clearly, several weeks ago, the news come out saying that (inaudible) indicated that 2007 kept your spending would be roughly flat at $20 billion. Wondering if you can confirm whether he has said that or not.", "Henry Hubble", "Well, yeah. I mean and I think those are round figures and we'll be updating specifically the outlook at the Analyst meeting as we always do and you'll get more detail there, but I would take that as a round figure.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Okay very good. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to Mark Gilman with the Benchmark Company.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "Hi, Henry, how are you?", "Henry Hubble", "Very good, Mark. ", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "Two questions. Exploratory expenses are running considerably higher this year both in the quarter you reported today as well as the first half and I was wondering if you could shed a little light on the factors contributing to that and in particular, the extent to which it is an activity induced increase as opposed to any changes in success rates.", "Henry Hubble", "No. I mean, it does, we do have higher levels of activity and it reflects, but it does reflect and you'll see it as different prospects, there are some dry holes in here too because we do have activity in that but it also covers of course all of our seismic and other work that's in that category, and we did have well costs that are in there in this time frame.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "Would you say activity increases is the primary driver?", "Henry Hubble", "No. I would say it's as much, I mean, it's activity on wells and then you have a certain number of them that are show up in those costs when they are non-economic, and so I guess when you say is it activity? Yeah, I mean, we do have higher activity on wells that are being drilled and some of those are showing up in this category.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "Okay one other one if I could. In light of what you said about Erha and it's performance, the African liquids number in the third quarter was lower than the second. Could you perhaps shed a little light on that apparent discrepancy?", "Henry Hubble", "It's basically timing entitlements I guess is the biggest issue.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "I'm not sure what you mean.", "Henry Hubble", "Well as prices rise, you have entitlement effects associated with that.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "Price was flat, Henry, quarter to quarter.", "Henry Hubble", "Well, if I look at the Africa, that is the biggest impact is entitlement costs or entitlement effects.", "Mark Gilman - Benchmark Company", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go now to Daniel Barcelo with Banc of America Securities.", "Daniel Barcelo - Banc of America Securities", "Hi, good morning. I wanted to know if you could just comment more conceptually about how Exxon views minority interest and certainly investments and in general, given some actions I guess with shell Canada in particular, how does Exxon view participation or ability to control capital spending or corporate government within some of it's subsidiaries there and if it has types of plans as well to look toward incorporating more of those minorities?", "Henry Hubble", "I'm sorry, I missed the front end of that?", "Daniel Barcelo - Banc of America Securities", "Regarding investments where you don't own 100% in your minority investments?", "Henry Hubble", "Yes.", "Daniel Barcelo - Banc of America Securities", "What is Exxon's strategy in order to essentially control say capital spending program, corporate governance -- ", "Henry Hubble", "Yeah, I mean, well, obviously, we're an active partner in anything where we're involved, and we go through in fact if you look at the upstream activities, we have a lot of ours are OBO arrangements there and of course we look at the risks involved and we'll offer our help in areas where the operator is seeking it, and we're active in those projects.", "Daniel Barcelo - Banc of America Securities", "You don't feel necessarily disadvantaged owning smaller stakes in that structure then?", "Henry Hubble", "No. Well, I mean, the whole reason you're in a project is because you're trying to get access to best resources and so we look at the resource quality. That's the first indicator and then we're working with them to make sure that it's as successful as possible and so we'll work with them on areas where we may have technical expertise or where we see a particular risk where we have some help to offer, we'll participate in that. But it's selective because there, the operator is the one that's running that.", "Daniel Barcelo - Banc of America Securities", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go now to Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank.", "Henry Hubble", "Hi, Paul.", "Operator", "Mr. Sankey, your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Hi, sorry, you surprised me by (inaudible). The one I had for you is the buyback. You made a forward-looking statement actually last quarter for the first time in my knowledge about the buyback levels but unless I missed it, you haven't made one about the outlook for this coming quarter and beyond, thanks.", "Henry Hubble", "No. Yeah, we didn't have any change there to make.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Okay so just work on the idea that it's a $7 billion quarter with an additional amount of anti-dilution?", "Henry Hubble", "Well, yeah. I'm not giving any forward guidance but you know we're relatively stable.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "That's it. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. That will conclude today's question and answer session. At this time I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Hubble for any additional or closing remarks.", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Thanks. Before we end the call, I'd just like to summarize a few points. Obviously, we had a very strong quarter and have been continually able to bring additional supply to the market, and ExxonMobile remains committed to managing our operations and providing high quality product to the market safely, reliably, efficiently, and responsibly, and as you can see from the results that we've announced today, we're delivering on those commitments.

Today's call is being recorded. ", "At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Henry Hubble. Please go ahead, sir. ", "Henry Hubble", "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Exxon Mobil's teleconference and webcast on our fourth quarter and full-year 2006 financial and operating results. As you are aware from this morning's press release, we had another strong quarter as our longstanding commitments to the integrity of our operations, disciplined investment and our integrated business model continued to deliver superior results. ", "At this time, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement. Please note that estimates, plans and projections are forward-looking statements. Actual results, including resource recoveries, volume growth and project plans and outcomes could differ materially due to factors I'll discuss and factors noted in our SEC filings. Please see \"Factors Affecting Future Results\" in the Form 8-K we furnished this morning which are available through the investor information section of our website. Please also see the frequently used terms, the supplement to this morning's 8-K and the 2005 financial and operating review on our website. This material defines certain financial and operating terms I will use today, shows Exxon Mobil's net interest in specific projects and includes information required by SEC Regulation G. ", "Now I'm pleased to turn your attention to the specific results. Exxon Mobil's fourth quarter net income was $10.3 billion, or $1.76 per share. These results included a $410 million one-time gain from the recognition of tax benefits related to historical investments in non-US assets. Excluding this gain, normalized earnings were $9.8 billion or $1.69 per share. This represents a decrease of $480 million versus last year's record fourth quarter. While absolute earnings were lower, normalized earnings per share were up from last year, due to the reduction in shares outstanding associated with our share purchase program. ", "For the full year 2006, net income of $39.5 billion was a record, and increased $3.4 billion from 2005. Normalized earnings were also a record at $39.1 billion, up $5.2 billion from 2005. ", "Before I discuss the specific business results, I would like to share some of the milestones achieved since the last earnings call. In the upstream, production commenced from the Dalia field in Angola Block 17, located in water depths of over 1,200 meters, 135 kilometers offshore. Dalia is estimated to contain close to 1 billion barrels of recoverable reserves and is expected to reach peak production of about 225,000 barrels of oil per day during the first quarter of this year. ", "Also starting up in the fourth quarter was the Fram East field in the Troll area of the Norwegian North Sea. We anticipate the recovery of approximately 60 million barrels of oil and 70 billion cubic feet of natural gas from the field. Fram East is expected to reach peak production of about 45,000 barrels of oil per day and 45 million cubic feet of natural gas per day in 2008. ", "Another milestone during the quarter was the early processing of LNG at RasGas Train 5 in Qatar. Start-up of the liquefaction train was only 29 months after contract award, a significant achievement for such a large facility and testament to the success of our design one, build many approach and outstanding project execution of the Qatar Petroleum and Exxon Mobil joint venture. ", "Offshore facilities that will supply the natural gas to the train on a long-term basis should be complete by the end of the first quarter. RasGas Train 5 is designed to produce 4.7 million tons per year of LNG for anticipated delivery to market in Asia and Europe. ", "Also in the quarter, we continued to ramp up crude oil production at our Sakhalin 1development in Russia producing over 200,000 barrels a day at year end. Production is expected to reach 250,000 barrels per day by the end of the first quarter. ", "Exxon Mobil also expanded its exploration opportunities during the quarter with new agreements for exploration in the deepwater [Sanakin] Basin southwest of the Philippine Islands. ", "In the downstream, the British Safety Council awarded the prestigious 2006 Sword of Honor to our US and UK-based marine transportation affiliates. The award was recognition of our commitment to workplace safety and health, high operating standards and disciplined management systems. As a multi-year recipient of this award, we continue to emphasize consistent and disciplined safety, health and environmental management in all aspects of our operations. ", "In our lubes business, we announced that Exxon Mobil will become the title sponsor for the Porsche One Mobil 1 Super Cup, further progressing 10 years of close commercial and technical global collaboration with Porsche. Porsche exclusively recommends Mobil 1 and every new Porsche engine leaves the assembly line filled with Mobil 1 oil. ", "During the quarter, our refining and supply business continued to grow profitability through crude diversification, running 41 crudes new to individual refineries, 16 of which were new to Exxon Mobil. In December, we completed a de-bottleneck of our Antwerp, Belgium refinery. This project increased distillation and conversion capacity at a fraction of grassroots costs and enhanced our ability to process advantage crudes. Our worldwide refinery capacity growth rate is equivalent to building a new refinery every three years but at significantly lower cost than new built. ", "Turning to the chemicals business. During the quarter, we announced the progression of a feasibility study with the Saudi Basic Industries Corporation, to expand the [Yenta] and [Kemya] petrochemical joint ventures in Saudi Arabia. The project will include expansion of capacity for carbon black, butyl rubber and thermolplastic specialty polymers for international and emerging local markets. Start-up is anticipated in the 2011 through 2012 timeframe. ", "In November, we announced an expansion of halobutyl rubber capacity at our Baytown, Texas plant that will increase production by 60%. This expansion, part of the Company's commitment to meet the strong global halobutyl rubber demand growth, follows an expansion that quadrupled capacity at Baytown in 2002. Targeted for completion during the second quarter of 2008, this project builds on Exxon Mobil's 70 years of experience in butyl rubber research and development, services and customer application. ", "Turning now to the business results. Upstream earnings in the fourth quarter were $6.2 billion, down $820 million from 2005, which was our highest fourth quarter on record. Lower natural gas realizations reduced gas volumes and net other items were the primary drivers for the earnings change, partly offset by improved crude realizations. ", "We continued to capture the benefit of strong industry conditions with upstream after-tax unit earnings of $15.99 per barrel for the quarter. Oil-equivalent volumes declined slightly versus the same quarter last year, driven by lower gas demand in Europe. Excluding entitlement effects and divestments, oil-equivalent volumes were up 2%. ", "Liquids production increased about 50,000 barrels per day or 2% versus the same quarter last year as the impact of project start-ups and increased Middle East volumes more than offset mature field declines and entitlement effects. ", "Gas volumes decreased 520 million cubic feet per day or about 5% versus the fourth quarter of 2005, due to the impact on demand of warmer weather in Europe. New project volumes and better up time, including the absence of hurricane effects in the US, offset natural field declines. ", "Turning now to the sequential comparison. Versus the third quarter of 2006, upstream earnings decreased by $270 million as lower realizations driven by an almost $10 per barrel decrease in crude prices reduced earnings by $820 million. However, this impact was largely offset by the increased volumes -- by increased volumes. Oil-equivalent volumes were up nearly 6% from the third quarter. ", "Liquids production increased 1% sequentially as we concluded to ramp up production at Sakhalin 1, while natural gas production was up 14%, due to seasonal demand increases in Europe. ", "Now looking at the full year results. Excluding special items, full year 2006 upstream earnings were a record $26.2 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion or 15% over 2005. The most significant factor driving that increase was markedly higher crude and natural gas realizations partly offset by production mix effects and net other items. ", "Full year equivalent production was up 4% versus 2005 with increased volumes in Africa and the Middle East. Liquids volumes were up 6% from 2005, while natural gas volumes were up 1%. Excluding divestments and entitlement effects, oil-equivalent volumes were up 6.6%. For further data on regional volumes, please refer to the press release and IR supplement. ", "Now let's turn to the downstream results. Downstream normalized earnings in the fourth quarter were nearly $2 billion, down $430 million from the fourth quarter last year. Lower margins reduced earnings by $820 million with markedly lower fuels refining and marketing margins partially offset by stronger lubes earnings. Other factors included positive LIFO and BorEx effect. ", "Sequentially, fourth quarter earnings decreased by $780 million. The primary drivers were lower refining and marketing margins, while reduced earnings -- which reduced earnings by $790 million. Improved refining operations more than offset seasonally lower fuels, marketing and lube sales. Other factors included positive LIFO impacts offset by higher planned maintenance and turnaround expenses. ", "Full year 2006 downstream normalized earnings were a record at just under $8.5 billion. Earnings increased $570 million from 2005, primarily due to stronger fuels and lubes marketing margins. Volume mix effects reduced earnings by $480 million reflecting higher planned turnaround activity, partially offset by self-help margin enhancement items, including raw material optimization and product upgrades. Other earnings effects improved earnings by $300 million, primarily positive BorEx and LIFO impacts. ", "Focusing now on our chemical results. Fourth quarter normalized earnings of $1.2 billion were up about $400 million versus the fourth quarter of 2005, reflecting higher margins, stronger volumes and positive LIFO effects partially offset by costs associated with turnaround activity. Sequentially, fourth quarter chemical earnings decreased by $110 million, reflecting seasonal volume mix and other effects partially offset by positive LIFO impacts. ", "Full year 2006 normalized chemical earnings were at a record, almost $4.4 billion, $980 million higher than full year 2005. Stronger margins in our integrated polyolefins and specialties businesses and higher volumes were the largest contributors to the improvement. Full year chemical prime product sales increased by about 2%, reflecting higher volumes across most business lines. ", "Our record 2006 earnings confirmed that our unique portfolio of chemical product lines, broad geographic coverage and integration with our downstream and upstream facilities provides us with a competitive advantage and delivers industry leading performance. ", "Turning now to the corporate and financing segment. As I mentioned earlier, we had a special tax item in the corporate and financing segment this quarter. Excluding that special item, the Corporation recorded fourth quarter earnings of $420 million in the segment, up about $360 million from the fourth quarter of 2005, primarily due to favorable tax items and increased interest income. ", "Excluding special items, full year 2006 corporate and financing earnings of $24 million were up by approximately $180 million from 2005, primarily due to higher interest income. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 37%. For full year 2006, the effective tax rate was 43%. ", "The Corporation distributed a total of almost $8.9 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. That's up almost $2.1 billion from the fourth quarter of 2005. Included in the $8.9 billion of fourth quarter distributions was $7 billion to purchase shares in excess of dilution. These purchases reduced the number of shares outstanding by 1.8%. For the full year 2006, we purchased $25 billion of shares in excess of dilution and reduced shares outstanding by 6.6%, further demonstrating our ongoing commitment to return cash to our shareholders. ", "CapEx in the fourth quarter was $5.1 billion. That takes full year CapEx to $19.9 billion, in line with our previous guidance, and an increase of approximately $2.2 billion from 2005, reflecting increased upstream investments. ", "Fourth quarter cash flow from operations and asset sales was $9.6 billion, including $2.4 billion in contributions to the US pension plan. At the end of the year, our cash balance was $32.8 billion and debt was $8.3 billion. ", "Finally, I would like to mention two upcoming events. First in mid-February, we'll be releasing our 2006 reserves performance data. And second, as many of you will have already seen, our analyst meeting this year will take place on March 7th, including a live audio webcast beginning at 9 a.m. Eastern, 8 a.m. Central Time. The meeting will include an update of our forward business plans. Exxon Mobil's presenters will be led by Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson. ", "That concludes my prepared remarks and I would now be happy to take your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer-Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] ", "We'll take our first question from Doug Terreson from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir. ", "Doug Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Congratulations on solid numbers, Henry. ", "Henry Hubble", "Thanks, Doug. ", "Doug Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "In the upstream, you mentioned that weather effects were significant for European natural gas sales in relation to the year ago period. ", "Henry Hubble", "Yes. ", "Doug Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "And on this point, can we attribute the year-over-year decline in product sales in Europe and Asia Pacific to the same factor? And if not, could you comment on the other major factors that were at work in the period? ", "Henry Hubble", "Well, when you look at the product volume sales, I mean, there are some impacts associated with weather -- and overall demand on obviously, heating oil sales in the area. But if you look at the weather effects, when we saw Europe was about 18% warmer than last year. ", "The United States was about 22% warmer as measured in degree days. And then if you look at the actual volumes that were down about 145 fourth quarter versus fourth quarter '05, there's a piece of that that is retail divestments. It's part of our ongoing divestment programs in the retail marketing area. You also saw -- that was offset some by higher INW and then we also had lower throughput in Europe and we saw some of that show up in fuel oil sales, associated with the Antwerp refinery being down in that time frame. ", "Doug Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Sure. ", "Henry Hubble", "So those were the primary impacts. ", "Doug Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And also in A&P, I just wanted to get an update on project status and specifically on a couple of projects and specifically how you guys view your position on Point Thompson in Alaska, [Natuna] in Indonesia and Papua, New Guinea gas and kind of the brief next steps on those three projects. ", "Henry Hubble", "Well, if you start with Point Thompson, basically there -- we've had an indication from -- or the state basically has taken away the -- or modified or did not approve our modified development plan there and revoked the leases, and we are currently in the process of pursuing that with them. We filed a couple of cases, as you may know. We asked for reconsideration of that -- those lease cancellations, which was denied. We're asking that to be reconsidered by the Superior Court and then we'll go -- we'll take it from there. We are also pursuing damages associated with the cancellation of those leases. ", "Doug Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Sure. ", "Henry Hubble", "When you look at Natuna, basically we are engaged in discussions there. Obviously, we'd like to move that forward. We're working with the Indonesian government on it. It's a challenging project. As you know, very high CO2 contents, and so we're basically working to have an amicable procedure going forward. ", "Doug Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. ", "Henry Hubble", "And then Papua, New Guinea, basically we continue to look at different options there on how we'll progress that project, and right now, it looks like LNG has a possibility but we are basically going through -- still at the concept stage there. ", "Doug Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thanks a lot. Henry, thanks. ", "Henry Hubble", "Yes. ", "Operator", "We'll take our next question come from Doug Leggate with Citigroup. Please go ahead, sir. ", "Doug Leggate - Citigroup", "Thank you. Good morning, Henry. ", "Henry Hubble", "Hi, Doug. ", "Doug Leggate - Citigroup", "Couple of things, Henry. I guess on the numbers really to help us reconcile things a bit. Could you walk us through the LIFO impacts and actually quantify them? On the downstream, just a follow-up, could you break out for me, please, the marketing and refining deltas both sequentially and year-over-year? ", "Henry Hubble", "Yes, okay. Just starting with LIFO, if you look at the total impact of LIFO, there was about $400 million, and this is really a reflection of our ongoing efforts to optimize inventories and improving the efficiency of our entire supply chain, essentially. And so, if you look at those splits, there was about $280 million associated with downstream in 2006, most of that in the non-US. ", "And then in chemical, we had $120 million positive, and that was split a little higher percentage in the US, about $70 in the US and the balance in non-US operations. And then if you are doing a comparison year-on-year, it was about $183 million above last year because this is something that we've had ongoing, -- as you know, ongoing effects as we continue to be able to optimize our inventory performance. ", "Doug Leggate - Citigroup", "Great. ", "Henry Hubble", "And then your other question was around the -- just the marketing breakdowns. Looking at the fourth quarter, comparisons there. ", "Doug Leggate - Citigroup", "Yes. It looked like your capture rates were much better. I think the LIFO impacts account for a large part of it, so maybe it's not as critical as I thought it was. ", "Henry Hubble", "Yes, if you look at -- if you just look at the fourth quarter versus fourth quarter comparison, most of the marketing -- I mean, most of the margin effects were in refining. And then that was -- and that was the big piece, small bit in marketing. ", "Doug Leggate - Citigroup", "Okay. Great. I don't know if that counts as two questions but let me try just squeezing in another one real quick. Your cash balance declined for, I guess, for the first time in quite a while. Any impact on your buyback plans going forward? ", "Henry Hubble", "We haven't -- we're not announcing any change there. ", "Doug Leggate - Citigroup", "Okay. Great. Thanks, sir. Thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Arjun Murti from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ", "Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. Henry, I recognize you have your analyst meeting coming up next month and you'll certainly make more comments on this front there, but your ENT capital spending has grown at a kind of a solid double digit clip over the last five years as you have spent on all of these major developments. ", "Henry Hubble", "Yes. ", "Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs", "You still have a big queue of developments to come. ", "Henry Hubble", "Yes. ", "Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs", "There's been industry inflation. You've done better than industry, but there is still industry inflation. Is there any reason to think your ENT capital spending doesn't continue to grow at a double digit rate or have there been some recent one-off factors in the last year or two that might slow the growth rate in the ENT capital spending going forward? ", "Henry Hubble", "Well, I mean, it's really -- the growth that you see in our -- is really a reflection of the projects that we have in the queue and we have a good pipeline of projects. We are continuing to advance those. ", "So last year -- we'll be updating this as we get together in March, but last year, basically, we were showing ourselves close to $20 billion going out in the future time frame. We'll be updating that basically reflecting the projects and the status of those projects and we'll talk more about it at the meeting. ", "Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs", "That's great, and I guess in terms of my second question, obviously Angola has joined OPEC. This has been a major source of your West African growth. I know it is very hard to predict what countries will do or say in terms of limiting or controlling growth going forward but do you all think of Angola any differently now that it's part of OPEC? Do you sit there and say maybe we slow down future projects in that country? Is there any change in your outlook for Angola as a result of it? ", "Henry Hubble", "No, we are very pleased with our Angolan developments and as you have no doubt seen, the exploration is going on in Block 31, 32. We have been pleased with progress there. But those projects will have to -- I mean, they are looking at how to bring those together to have a successful development. But we're still very encouraged with Angola, and don't really see this as a change from our perspective. ", "Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs", "That's great. Thank you very much. ", "Henry Hubble", "Yes. ", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question come from Nicki Decker from Bear Stearns. Please go ahead. ", "Nicki Decker - Bear Stearns", "Good morning, Henry. ", "Henry Hubble", "Hi, Nicki. ", "Nicki Decker - Bear Stearns", "So just specifically on the production volumes, can you talk about what happened in Africa? The Africa liquids production was a little bit lower than we had expected. And then for my second question, as we look into next year, and all of the factors that are affecting production, other than organic growth of sales and PSC effects and OPEC issues, is there any reason to believe that your production might vary from your targeted 3% to 4% growth next year? I'm sorry, in 2007. That would be this year? ", "Henry Hubble", "Yes, right. Just starting with the Africa piece of this. The African volumes are primarily driven by lower Angola volumes due to the entitlement effects and we have been seeing those going on a continuing basis. Some of that production comes from -- in fact, all of it is production sharing contract related. And those PSCs, they have -- that entitlement is reduced when the cumulative production or cumulative profitability thresholds are reached so there's been continuing impacts there as we have seen higher prices, all of which basically has made those projects more attractive and really we're very pleased with their performance. If you look at the other impact in that time frame, we did have some unscheduled downtime in Nigeria that also impacted in the period that may have been part of the miss that you had. ", "Nicki Decker - Bear Stearns", "Okay. So can you talk about the impact in Nigeria, Henry? ", "Henry Hubble", "I mean, it was basically associated with -- I will have to get some specifics about what that -- what that was. Yes, let me come back to you on that, because I don't have anything right at the tip of my fingers here. ", "Nicki Decker - Bear Stearns", "Okay. ", "Henry Hubble", "When we look at -- when we look at the production, we don't really -- I don't really have a product target going forward. The 3% that we have talked about, when you look at -- that's an outcome of the projects that we have in the plans, and as we said, it will be lumpy depending on how projects come on, and it was a reflection of those projects over a longer period of time. So you see -- you are going to see some positive peaks when you have more projects coming on and dips in that, and we really haven't tried to get into year by year kind of outlook on that. ", "Nicki Decker - Bear Stearns", "Thanks, Henry. ", "Henry Hubble", "Yes. Well, I guess the bulk -- from what I'm looking here, maybe the bulk of that Nigerian piece is associated with declines. And I just don't have any specifics on the outages at this point. ", "Nicki Decker - Bear Stearns", "Okay. Great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Paul Cheng from Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead. ", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Hi, good morning. Henry, on the -- if we are looking at over the next four months if I look at, say, from a collective basis for the quarter is going to reach the payoff period, what may be a job in your production related debt? ", "Henry Hubble", "And you're talking about Angola or --? ", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "No, I mean on your global portfolio. I mean, you must have some project that you are bringing on a lot of project over the last three years with the high prices. I presume that some of them over the next 12 months will reach the payoff period and it's such that your report production will see a reduction. Any kind of --? ", "Henry Hubble", "Yes, I -- ", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "-- rough number you can share that the impact may be for next year, for 2007? ", "Henry Hubble", "Right. No. I don't have -- we'll talk about our production profile, which we'll take into those -- into account those kinds of effects when -- as we are doing that forward projection. But again, it's going to depend on the price. It depends on specific contracts. There are a lot of individual production and they're -- depending on when they started up and the time frame that they have been running, how they have been performing, all of those things will impact that, and it will be incorporated into that forward projection, but I don't have anything that I can give you in terms of a forward, forward look on that. ", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. If I could, I want to sneak in two more questions in here. ", "Henry Hubble", "Yes. ", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "One, if you can give us an update where is the [Kitachee] project for you? I mean with the rapid rise in the cost, is the project still a go or that you guys having some second thought? ", "And also I think during the -- your recovery (inaudible), you had indicate some of the foreign exchange gain or loss, I think in both chemical and the O&M, I don't know whether you have that in the upstream, if you can break it down for us versus the third quarter, what is the impact? ", "Henry Hubble", "Yes, I sure can. If you look at the BorEx effects in the third -- versus the third quarter, they were almost nothing. I think for the total corporation, it was under $30 million. So there's nothing in there on BorEx in the sequential comparison. ", "Back on the Qatar question with the GTL project, I mean the technical work continues there. There are cost pressures, no question about that. We are working very hard on the concept of development with the Qatarries and what we have found in all of these projects is the real focus -- you have to get that development concept right or you lose it. And so that -- we're spending the time to get that concept right, and so when we're ready to go forward from there, we will let you know, but we are still optimistic about it. We are working on that development concept. ", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "So I assume that I think initially, there were some expectations by 2011, 2012. That time frame probably is too aggressive? ", "Henry Hubble", "We will be updating whatever on those kind of things at the analyst meeting. ", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Henry Hubble", "Right. ", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Dan Barcelo from Banc of America. Please go ahead. ", "Dan Barcelo - Banc of America", "Hi, good morning. Regarding the downstream, it seems a lot of your competitors are really looking to sell a lot more refining assets. In particular, these values seem to be a little bit below replacement costs, especially when you compare it to Middle Eastern type new building costs. ", "Henry Hubble", "Yes. ", "Dan Barcelo - Banc of America", "I don't know if you could just comment rather broadly on Exxon's view of, in particular, downstream, in particular in terms of divestments or additions. ", "Henry Hubble", "Yes. I mean, we're not going to -- I'm not going to speculate on specific divestments. We are always looking at our portfolio. So -- and looking at what is -- why there's more value to somebody else than there is to us, and we'll market things, and you did see us -- I mean we sold our -- our Englestock refinery. ", "So -- but I would tell you that overall, when we look at the refining business, we feel very good about the refining business. We work hard on integration with our chemicals business and because we have those integrated operations with chemicals, with our lubes businesses, it makes them more resilient. ", "The other things, the technologies that we employ in molecule management and other techniques that we have and improving reliability, operations, integrity, we've had very good returns in this business and what we do is -- every one of our refineries has a forward looking plan, a five-year plan, and they are basically planning to stay ahead of whatever that long-term margin trend is, which you have heard us talk about before. If you look at the long-term trend, it is down. ", "We make sure we are staying ahead of that curve. So we feel good about the assets that we have there, but I don't rule out that there might be specific pieces that will be more valuable to somebody else than us, and we'll let you know if those things occur. ", "Dan Barcelo - Banc of America", "Perfect. Thanks very much. ", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Hi, Henry. Forgive me if you have answered this question. I know the word capital is being bandied about but my understanding is that you've got some issues there with the LNG trains. Could you just fill us in? I think they are shut down as far as I understand it or at least some of them. Could you just fill us in on the latest news there? ", "Henry Hubble", "Yes. Well, what you were hearing about, we had some hydrate problems in the pipelines coming in. And basically, those facilities are essentially back up at this point. But it did impact us during the month of January. And what happened, we saw some rising pressure. ", "Our monitoring equipment caught it. So we saw the pressure drop, increasing there, and then basically we are going through a process of clearing that out, which takes a little bit of time. So there was some -- we work with customers because there were some customers we had to restrict volumes on. And they are basically back up now. ", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. So the story was -- I think it was Train 4 -- was it 3, 4, and 5 were down, but basically what you are saying is they were only out for, what, I guess a matter of three weeks, two-three weeks? ", "Henry Hubble", "Yes, and the impact varies -- it's not -- basically, it makes sure that we're cleaning the lines up and so you ended up with less than full impact as you went through this time frame. And then, of course, we are going through a very thorough investigation to understand what variables changed and what caused the problems that we had there so that it won't happen again. ", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Right. And for my second question, I'm going to ask you a double question as part of it. Firstly, could you just comment on what your turnaround schedule or downtime will look like in terms of turning around refineries, if there's anything unusual in the US and internationally this quarter and this year? And a follow-on is that it is notable, following up on Doug's question, that volumes are down if we look at the whole year of '06 from '05. Was that disposals or was it -- was there some other reason why your sales of product, petroleum products was quite sharply down compared to global demand? Thanks. ", "Henry Hubble", "Yes, okay. First off, I mean, just looking at the turnaround schedule, this year was a little bit heavier than typical and we are seeing it being similar next year, so in the same kind of -- in the same kind of range. And that is the primary impact on volumes. The other, again, is divestments, and there's hydrating in our portfolio. It's lower refinery throughputs and then you see that roll through in things like fuel oil sales. You'll see some in the specialty product sales because we had more pull to chemicals and of course, Englestock came out of that -- those numbers as well. So those are -- those were the big impacts. ", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Right. And if we look at -- if you look at what the real oil market is doing, I guess it was up by what percent in '06 would you say on your numbers, and what do you expect in '07 and I will leave it there? ", "Henry Hubble", "In terms of overall liquid demand? ", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Yes. ", "Henry Hubble", "Yes, I mean and that's probably the best way to look at it. We do the global balances and what are projected in our original projections would have been higher than how it's turned out this year. And we'd see overall demand worldwide somewhere in the million barrel a day increase, something maybe a little less than that when you took a total global balance. ", "And that really reflects -- when we start looking behind it as to what impacted that, we think weather was a significant factor in there. If you look at the demands in the first quarter of last -- '06 and fourth quarter of '06, also if you look at some of the -- just the pricing between fuel oil and natural gas, there was fuel switching that was going on. ", "So we think those were some of the things that were driving demands a little bit more than overall economics because when we look at the comparisons of -- for the long haul, it really correlates best with economic growth and we really haven't seen any slowdowns in economic growth and that's really what drives it overall in the longer term. ", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks, Henry. ", "Henry Hubble", "Yes. ", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question come from Mark Gilman from The Benchmark Company. Please go ahead. ", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "Henry, good morning. I had two questions. First one relates to Nigeria. It is my understanding that you have opted not to proceed with a grassroots LNG project in Nigeria and I was wondering if you could confirm that and discuss briefly the reasons for that decision. ", "My second question relates to tax rate. If I quickly to through the arithmetic and make the adjustment for the special item, the tax rate gets up to about 39% effective basis for the quarter if I'm doing the math right. ", "Given business mix and things of that sort, where we were in this regard in the first three quarters of '06, a rate in the 42% to 44% range would have seemed to have been where it should have been. I wonder if you comment on, perhaps, some of the factors that are responsible for that difference, and whether they are sustainable going forward. ", "Henry Hubble", "Yes, right. Well, if you look at the first stuff on the Nigerian LNG project. I mean it's really premature for me to comment on that. We're still in the working phase on that to look at that project so there hasn't been any final decisions made one way or the other there. ", "When you look at the tax impact, the special item was one piece that impacted our overall tax in the period but then as I mentioned also, there were some other items in our corp. and fin that increased -- that were positive to earnings. Those were -- and the reason -- the one was broken out as a special because it was large and it was non-recurring so it was identified as a special. ", "The others -- we have always seen a certain number of tax effects, as you know, just because of the size of the Company, all the different jurisdictions we are involved in, but in the period, there were a number of return finalizations that occurred that basically went all in the same direction so it was a combination of those impacts that ended up. If you look at our longer term projection on tax, we would still guide in the 40%, 45% range and probably toward the higher end of that so typical of what we saw earlier in the year is, I think, the best way to look at it. ", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "Thanks, Henry. ", "Henry Hubble", "Yes. ", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Mark Flannery from Credit Suisse. Please, go ahead, sir. ", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Hi, Henry. ", "Henry Hubble", "Hi, Mark. ", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Could you comment a little bit on what is going on in Asian R&M? We have seen some fairly weak numbers out of the Japanese market recently. You have a big business there. I'm just wondering how weak was that in the fourth quarter and is there any sign that margins or earnings or sales are going to get a bit better up there? ", "Henry Hubble", "Yes, if you look at the margins in refining, out in the Asia Pacific, they were off. It got pretty weak during the fourth quarter of '06, actually, ex-Japan. It was outside of Japan. Japan had actually strengthened some in the period. And then if you look at -- on the marketing side, it varies but basically we were up. The marketing margins were up in Asia Pacific and Japan, comparing the -- if you go fourth quarter versus fourth quarter. So, most the negative impact on marketing margins or refining margins were US and Europe in those periods -- in the comparative period. ", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "And what about sales volumes, specifically in Japan I'm thinking. Are you seeing any weakness there or --? ", "Henry Hubble", "Well, I don't know if I've got a breakdown on Japanese demand. ", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Maybe you can talk about Asia in general, maybe. ", "Henry Hubble", "Yes. If I look at Asia Pacific, it was down about -- quarter-on-quarter, it was down about 5%, and that really -- it was essentially mostly associated with lower runs and then we see the continuing growth in our chemicals business. We did have more transfers to chemicals so that's the other thing that goes on that's impacted some of those sales. It was basically a positive story there. And those were the bigger impacts. ", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Thanks a lot. ", "Henry Hubble", "Yes. ", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Neil McMahon from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. ", "Oxy Oswald Clint - Sanford Bernstein", "Hi, good morning. Hi, it's Oxy Oswald Clint here on behalf of Neil who is at the Shell presentation. Just two questions -- ", "Henry Hubble", "Okay. ", "Oxy Oswald Clint - Sanford Bernstein", "Could you give us an update, please, on your decline rifts across the portfolio in 2006 versus 2005? And secondly, you mentioned Dalia in your press update this morning. Can you confirm any spending or the rumors that it's actually progressing well ahead of expectations? ", "Henry Hubble", "Yes. I mean, as far as I know, Dalia is coming up and ramping up. We're expecting to get up to full rates by the end of the -- I think it's the first quarter, targeted at 225. So I mean, it's come on well, but it's probably better to focus that back at the operator. And then if you look at our declines, there really aren't any big surprises there. ", "We look at the year -- obviously we monitor this very closely, field by field. You do have more decline in the maturer markets but if you look at our overall target, or guidance that we have had, we have said 4% to 6%, closer to the higher end of that range, and we have seen nothing that's really taken us out of there, nothing unusual in that at all. ", "Oxy Oswald Clint - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. That's great. Thank you. ", "Henry Hubble", "Yes ", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] ", "We'll take our next question from John Herrlin from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, sir. ", "John Herrlin - Merrill Lynch", "Yes, hi. Henry, I know that later on this month, you are going to announce your reserve additions. ", "Henry Hubble", "Yes. ", "John Herrlin - Merrill Lynch", "But given Aira, Kizomba, Qatar, Obrizagam, would it be fair to say that your production replacement for 2006 would be better than 2005? ", "Henry Hubble", "I'm not really not going to get -- we'll have it out here shortly. The thing that you have to remember in all of these things, though, is the timing of when a project comes on and when it's funded. That's -- mostly it's decisions and recognition of reserves or actually when you have a full funding decision and you are proceeding forward. So there's often a skewing between when something is funded and when it comes online that those reserves are often recognized at different periods. But we'll update you here shortly. ", "John Herrlin - Merrill Lynch", "I thought it was worth a shot. Thanks anyway. ", "Henry Hubble", "Yes, okay. ", "John Herrlin - Merrill Lynch", "Next question is on Venezuela. Even though it's not a large part of your business, lots of headline risks these days. Have you heard from them? When will you hear from them or how are things going there? ", "Henry Hubble", "Well, it's -- I mean, the discussions continue. We don't really have anything new to report there. Our affiliate has been informed that they would like to migrate to mixed enterprise, and basically the ball is a bit in Venezuela's court right now. ", "So we'll see. We'd like to get an amicable resolution, obviously. We are looking to maintain the shareholder value from the projects that we invested in there and so hopefully we can work out something that will allow us to do all of that. ", "John Herrlin - Merrill Lynch", "Great. Last one from me. US production decline rates, just normal field declines? ", "Henry Hubble", "Yes. There was a little bit in there associated with Prudhoe Bay loadings that impacted in the period, but that's the biggest thing. ", "John Herrlin - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, Henry. ", "Henry Hubble", "Yes. ", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] ", "We'll take our next question from Mark Gilman from The Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.

", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "-- in your comments and I'm wondering whether we should expect a similar level contribution for this year. ", "Henry Hubble", "No. I wouldn't -- we evaluate these things on an ongoing basis. I can't really tell you yes or no on that. We constantly are looking at that and deciding when it makes sense to. We saw an opportunity here and -- for funding that we went ahead and exercised this year but I wouldn't read anything into that on a forward basis. ", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "Okay, and secondly, can you give us in absolute terms the price finalization impacts on the refining area split US and foreign in the fourth quarter?

Edwards ", " Gene Pisasale - Mercantile Capital ", "Operator", "Good day and welcome, everyone, to this ExxonMobil Corporation first quarter 2007 earnings conference call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the program over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Henry Hubble. Please go ahead, sir. ", "Henry Hubble", "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to ExxonMobil's teleconference and webcast on our first quarter 2007 financial and operating results. As you are aware from this morning\u2019s press release, we have had another strong quarter. Our integrated portfolio of businesses has performed well, enabling us to capture the benefits of strong industry conditions. ", "While commodity prices were lower in the quarter and we saw the impact of warm weather in Europe on natural gas demand, our upstream earnings remained strong and our downstream and chemical businesses delivered excellent results. ", "Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement. Please note that estimates, plans and projections are forward-looking statements. Actual results, including resource recoveries, volume growth and project outcomes could differ materially due to factors I discussed and factors noted in our SEC filings. Please see factors affecting future results and the Form 8-K we furnished this morning, which are available through the investor information section of our website. ", "Please also see the frequently used terms, the supplements to this morning\u2019s press release, and the 2006 financial and operating review on our website. This material defines certain financial and operating terms I will use today, shows ExxonMobil's net interest in specific projects, and includes information required by SEC Regulation G. ", "Now I am pleased to turn your attention to the first quarter results. ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings were $9.3 billion, or $1.62 per share. This was a record first quarter for the corporation and represents an increase of almost $900 million, or 10% from the first quarter of 2006. ", "Earnings per share were up 18% from the first quarter last year, as shareholders continue to benefit from the combination of our share purchase program and strong operating results. ", "Before I discuss specific business results, I would like to share some of our recently achieved milestones. In the upstream, as part of our successful partnership with Qatar Petroleum, the offshore production facilities that will provide the long-term supply of natural gas to RasGas train 5 and Qatar started up. This follows the start-up of the liquefaction train and early processing of LNG in the fourth quarter. ", "RasGas train 5, designed to produce 4.7 million tons per year of LNG, was completed under budget and ahead of schedule. The project further demonstrates ExxonMobil's industry-leading project management capability and the benefits of our long-term commitment to delivering advantage technology. ", "We had several exploration milestones during the quarter. In February, we signed an exploration and production sharing agreement with Libya\u2019s National Oil Corporation to initiate exploration activity in the Sirte Basin offshore Libya. ", "Also in February, we were awarded exploration rights to acreage in the Carnarvon basin approximately 100 kilometers off the northwest coast of Western Australia. ", "In March, we signed a production sharing contract with the Indonesian Government for exploration of the Mandar block, located in the Makassar offshore West Sulawesi. ", "Also in the upstream, and building on our continuing success at Sakhalin 1, we recently announced the completion of the Chayvo Z-11 well. At over 37,000 feet, the Z-11 well is the longest measured depth extended reach well in the world, and utilizing ExxonMobil proprietary technologies, was drilled below expected cost and ahead of schedule. ", "In downstream and chemical, ExxonMobil along with our partners, Saudi Aramco, Sinopec, and the Fujian Province, achieved significant milestones during the quarter with the formal government approval of joint venture contracts and the granting of business licenses for two joint venture projects located in the Fujian Province. ", "The Fujian Refining and Ethylene joint venture project and the Fujian Fuels Marketing joint venture project are the first fully integrated refining petrochemicals and fuels marketing projects with foreign participation in China. ", "The Fujian Refining and Ethylene joint venture project, scheduled to start up in early 2009, will triple capacity at the existing refinery, from 80,000 barrels per day to 240,000 barrels per day. ", "In addition, the project will construct new petrochemical facilities, including the addition of an 800,000 ton per year ethylene steam cracker, polyethylene and polypropylene units, and an aromatics complex. ", "The project also includes the installation of co-generation facilities. ", "The Fujian Fuels Marketing joint venture project will operate a network of terminals and approximately 750 services stations in Fujian province. ", "Together, these joint ventures will help to meet China\u2019s rapidly growing demand for petroleum products and petrochemicals. Synergies from these two world-scale integrative businesses, combined with the strengths of the partners and a long-term crude supply agreement with Saudi Aramco, significantly enhance the competitiveness of this project and will help ensure its world-class performance. ", "In our chemical business, we increased ethylene capacity at our Singapore chemical plant by 75,000 tons per year to more than 900,000 tons per year in response to growing regional demand for petrochemical products. ", "We also completed several debottleneck projects at our synthetics plant in Beaumont, Texas, resulting in a 15% capacity increase. This increased polyalphaolefins, or PAO, production will help support growing demand for high-performance lubricants. ", "Also in the quarter, the ExxonMobil Baton Rouge polyolefins plant received the distinguished safety award, the highest award given by the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association, or NPRA, for the fifth year in a row. Since the NPRA\u2019s safety awards program began in 1982, no other company has received this prestigious award for five consecutive years. ", "Finally, during the first quarter we announced the corporation\u2019s support for the National Math and Science Initiative launched in March to foster the next generation of scientists and engineers. ExxonMobil's $125 million commitment is the largest ever to support math and science education. ", "Turning now to the business line results, upstream earnings in the first quarter were $6 billion. This represents a decrease of $340 million versus the first quarter of 2006, primarily due to lower crude and natural gas realizations. ", "Natural gas volumes were also reduced in Europe, with lower demand due to warmer weather. These negative effects were partly offset by higher liquids volumes and other items, including the absence of a 2006 litigation expense and net positive tax items. ", "Worldwide crude realizations, sales realizations, were $54.64 per barrel, down $2.23 from the first quarter of 2006. ", "Upstream after tax unit earnings in the first quarter of 2007 remained strong at $15.13 per barrel. ", "Oil equivalent production volumes decreased 3% versus the same quarter last year, driven by lower natural gas demand due to warmer weather in Europe. That effect reduced volumes by 5%, or about 230,000 oil equivalent barrels per day from first quarter 2006, and offset increased volumes from major projects -- from first quarter 2006 and offset increased volumes from major project start-ups in Africa, Russia and Qatar. ", "Excluding cumulative entitlement, divestment and OPEC quota effects, first quarter production would have been up about 1%, despite the reduction in European natural gas demand. ", "Liquids production increased 49,000 barrels per day, or 2% from the same quarter last year, with increased volumes in Africa and the Middle East, reflecting recent project start-ups and higher production at Sakhalin 1 in Russia, which reached peak capacity of 250,000 barrels per day in the quarter. These increases were partly offset by natural fuel decline in mature areas and cumulative entitlement effects. ", "Gas volumes decreased about 1 billion cubic feet per day, or 9% versus the first quarter of 2006. Markedly lower European demand was partially offset by higher production in Qatar, including the impact of RasGas train 5 start-up. ", "Turning to the sequential comparison, versus the fourth quarter of 2006, upstream earnings decreased about $180 million, primarily due to lower natural gas realizations, partly offset by increased volumes. Liquids production increased 3%, due to higher volumes in Africa and Russia, while natural gas production was up 9%, primarily due to seasonally higher demand in Europe. Oil equivalent volumes were up 5% from the fourth quarter. ", "For further data on regional volumes, please refer to the press release and IR supplement. ", "Now let\u2019s turn to the downstream results. Downstream earnings were a record for the first quarter at $1.9 billion, up $640 million from the first quarter last year. Margins improved across our integrated downstream businesses, benefiting earnings by over $500 million. Earnings also improved due to net favorable tax items and improved refining operations. ", "In the first quarter, we continued to capture the value from our feedstock flexibility and optimization programs, running 35 new crudes new to individual refineries, five of which were new to ExxonMobil. ", "Sequentially, first quarter earnings were lower by $48 million, as improved margins were more than offset by volume mix effects and the absence of positive LIFO impacts. Higher margins improved earnings by $300 million, with stronger global refinery margins partially offset by lower fuels marketing margins. ", "Volume mix effects reduced earnings by $200 million, primarily due to refinery turnaround activity in the U.S. and Europe. ", "Other factors include the absence of positive LIFO and tax effects, partially offset by lower operating costs. ", "Focusing now on our chemical results, first quarter earnings were $1.2 billion, up about $290 million versus the first quarter of 2006. Higher margins improved earnings by $225 million, reflecting increased realizations in our key commodities and specialties businesses, particularly in Europe and Asia-Pacific. ", "Other impacts were positive $70 million, reflecting favorable for-ex impacts due to the weaker U.S. dollar. ", "Sequentially, first quarter chemical earnings were essentially flat. Improved margins and lower operating costs were offset by the absence of positive LIFO effects. ", "Turning now to our corporate and financing segment, the corporation recorded first quarter earnings of $90 million in the corporate and financing segment, versus an expense of approximately $200 million in the first quarter of 2006, reflecting higher interest income and the positive impact of several tax items. ", "The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 44%. The corporation distributed a total of $8.8 billion to shareholders in the first quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding, up 26% from the first quarter of 2006. ", "During the quarter, ExxonMobil purchased $7 billion of shares in excess of dilution, reducing the number of shares outstanding by 1.7% and further demonstrating our ongoing commitment to return cash to shareholders. ", "Yesterday, the board announced an increase in the quarterly dividend of just over 9% to $0.35 per share. ExxonMobil has paid a dividend for more than 100 years and has increased its annual dividend payments for 25 consecutive years. ", "CapEx in the first quarter was $4.3 billion. ", "At the end of the first quarter, our cash balance was $34.6 billion and debt was $8.8 billion. ", "In summary, this quarter\u2019s results again reflect, again highlight the quality of our integrated business model. Upstream earnings remain strong, despite the falling commodity prices and the impact on natural gas demand of warm weather in Europe, while the downstream and chemical businesses posted outstanding results, driving record first quarter earnings for the corporation. ", "That concludes my prepared remarks. I would now be happy to take your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) ", "Our first question will come from Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank. ", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "I had a kind of big question on the subject of the dollar. Could you try to help us understand the extent to which shifts in the dollar have perhaps affected your earnings this quarter? Any other sensitivities you could give us in that direction would be very interesting. Thank you. ", "Henry Hubble", "If you look at the for-ex effects in the quarter, year-on-year comparison, it was about $220 million associated with for-ex across all of the business lines. About $135 million of that was in the upstream, minor effect, downstream about 20 and chemicals 60, so that makes up the total there. ", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Is there any way of thinking about -- I guess we could just at the way the dollar has changed on a purchasing power parity basis, or how can we work that into the sensitivity for every dollar change in the exchange rate? ", "Henry Hubble", "I do not really have a rule of thumb I can give you on that. ", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Fair enough. On your CapEx, that\u2019s the second question, that is notably down. Is it possible to break down the extent to which that was in the sub-sectors? You know how your CapEx has changed, any extra detail on upstream but also just between the sub-sectors? Also, just if you could talk about the outlook for the full year against what you outlined. Thanks. ", "Henry Hubble", "When you look at CapEx, most of the impacts that you see in a quarter are on a quarter-to-quarter basis. There is just variation that you get in the timing of expenditures and there is a breakdown in the supplemental data that just goes through the actual spend and by each of the -- by upstream, downstream and chemicals, both U.S. But if you look at our full year outlook, it is unchanged from what we guided earlier, about $20 billion. ", "Again, it is really just a matter of timing. Projects are moving ahead on schedule. We don\u2019t really have any issues in that regard at all. ", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Nicky Decker with Bear Stearns. ", "Nicky Decker - Bear Stearns", "Henry, on Venezuela, there are news reports out yesterday that ExxonMobil, among others, participated in a signing agreement ceremony to hand off operations. Would you confirm this, number one, and elaborate maybe on the decisions that were made and what decisions are pending? ", "Henry Hubble", "As was described at the analyst meeting, we are really on a parallel path, two parallel paths here. One is to have an effective hand over of operations May 1st to the Venezuelan Government, and that is what you were reading about in the press, was basically progress in that regard. That has really been our main focus at this point, is to make sure we have a safe hand over of the operations and working with the personnel that will be taking over there, and any signing that was associated with that. ", "There is still work to be done and that is not at all resolved as to compensation and maintaining shareholder values. Those negotiations are continuing and will be for some period of time yet. ", "Nicky Decker - Bear Stearns", "Henry, does this signing yesterday, should we take that to mean that ExxonMobil plans to stay in Venezuela? ", "Henry Hubble", "I would not speculate one way or the other on that. It is going to depend on the negotiations that go forward. All we are doing is basically making sure that we have things ready for hand over and have that proceed as smoothly as possible. ", "Operator", "We will go next to Doug Terreson with Morgan Stanley. ", "Doug Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Congratulations on great results, Henry. My question regards demand, specifically ExxonMobil's refined product sales were flat on a year-over-year basis, with strength in the U.S. offset by weakness in Asia. I think that same trend was present last quarter, too. I wanted to see if there was any color that you could provide as it relates to rate of change in demand that you guys are experiencing in those two regions. You did talk a little bit about weather in Europe. If you could provide some color versus the year-ago period or sequentially I would appreciate it. ", "Henry Hubble", "If you look year-on-year, we are seeing year-on-year demand increases and really, that is -- if you look at where that is occurring, and again it correlates back to, over the longer haul, to economic growth. In a quarter-to-quarter kind of comparison, a lot of things can influence that and it is really hard to determine and you will see revisions to numbers as people continue to talk about it, but we are seeing strength in product sales in the U.S. and the Asia-Pac area in particular. ", "Of course, we saw in the first quarter some impacts associated with weather on distillate sales and you see some higher inventories there, but a lot of this reflects the higher through-puts that we had in refining and additional sales associated with that. ", "Doug Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, and also on the Fujian refining and petrochemicals, I think that the press release initially suggested start-up in early 2009, which seems pretty quick to me given the circumstances. My question regards whether or not that timetable is still valid, and if not could you provide your updated expectations for start-up at that plant? ", "Henry Hubble", "2009 is what we have out there at this point and we will be working that -- there has been a lot of up-front work done on the project, so basically we feel pretty comfortable about our execution plans there. So it will be moving ahead. ", "Doug Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. I know it\u2019s been in the pipeline for a while. Thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "We will go now to Doug Leggate with Citigroup. ", "Doug Leggate - Citigroup", "Thank you. Good morning, Henry. Henry, a couple of things from me. One is kind of more thematic, I guess. Your refinery runs were fine this quarter but there seems to be an awful lot of noise around unplanned downtime. Exxon I guess has been mentioned once or twice in that regard. Are you seeing anything specific in terms of how your refinery business is coping with all the specification changes, the wealth of implementation I guess over the last year. I am thinking in the context of effective utilization rates may be going back a little bit just on the margins. Just a general view on that would be great. ", "Henry Hubble", "If you look, we had very strong performance. Throughputs were up, good reliability performance during the quarter. We are not seeing anything. We are running the refineries full but as a former refiner, that really does not impact the reliability of the operations. We focus on taking things down as appropriate for maintenance, and a lot of programs associated with that to enhance reliability. But the specifications are a challenge in that you have to meet those and get them all the way through to the delivery system, but we have not really had any problems in that regard and don\u2019t foresee any in our own operations. ", "Doug Leggate - Citigroup", "Great, and I guess my follow-up is maybe if you could just break down a couple of the tax items you mentioned at the corporate line, and maybe a run-rate that you would expect for that line for the balance of the year. ", "Henry Hubble", "If you look at the tax items, there isn\u2019t anything specific to point out. There are a lot of, as you know, because we are very large, we have a lot of different tax jurisdictions around the world. There\u2019s frequently impacts associated in tax but I would not characterize it as anything that is particularly noteworthy in terms of an individual item. So there is nothing really I have to highlight there in particular. ", "If you look at the guidance on the corp and fin side, there is variation in those. There are a lot of components that go into the corp and fin numbers -- headquarters costs, pension costs, interest rates and payments there, so that is what is causing some of the variation that you see. We still guide in the $50 million to $100 million of costs, maybe toward the lower end of that. ", "Doug Leggate - Citigroup", "That\u2019s great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Dan Barcelo with Banc of America, your line is open. ", "Dan Barcelo - Banc of America", "Good morning. I have a question regarding the downstream; on a year-over-year basis, you had refining throughput as mentioned before was up strongly, around 2%, 5% in the U.S. When I look at the downstream earnings guide though, there I look at the volume mix and I see that only contributed about $50 million in earnings. I don\u2019t know if you can give a little color on should we have seen more of an effect on earnings because of the significant throughput, or does mix offset that? ", "Henry Hubble", "Well, there are some offsets in there. There is a bit of -- it was actually, if you -- again, you were looking at the first quarter versus first quarter last year? ", "Dan Barcelo - Banc of America", "That\u2019s correct. ", "Henry Hubble", "So if I\u2019m looking at it, the refinery ops impact was actually more positive than that. There was some negatives associated with volumes in the marketing side of the business, largely associated with the divestments that we have had there. And then you also have turnaround impacts that have some impact and the unit mix of the turnarounds that were associated with that, but no, there\u2019s -- the operations actually we feel very good about and that\u2019s performing well. ", "Dan Barcelo - Banc of America", "Great. Just for the follow-up, a very subtle question in terms of in your statement, you say that you will do a buy-back from time to time in the open market, but you always refer to through negotiated transactions also as an option. By that wording, does that include something of the like like a Volero has done today with an accelerated share repurchase, or do you mean something totally different? ", "Henry Hubble", "All of our share repurchases have been done on a rateable basis, daily rateable basis and that has been our ongoing -- and basically it\u2019s -- we don\u2019t anticipate changing that, but obviously you have options but all of ours have been on a rateable daily basis. ", "Dan Barcelo - Banc of America", "Perfect. Thanks very much. ", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Mark Gillman with the Benchmark company. ", "Mark Gillman - Benchmark", "Good morning. I wanted to see if we could get a little bit of clarification on two production volume items. First, with respect to the Middle Eastern gas, the number was quite strong. I wonder if you could just give me an idea what that number reflects in terms of Al Khaleej and where the ramp-up on that stands and whether it reflects RasGas 5 and the production facilities that you have referenced on a full basis. ", "Henry Hubble", "As you point out, we were up almost 400 million cubic feet a day there, if you look first quarter versus fourth quarter. The big impact or the largest single impact associated with RasGas train 5 start-up, also had strong performance with the other Qatar projects. We have seen stronger local sales associated with the Al Khaleej project there and basically we are at record rates post the hybrid issue that we had earlier. ", "Mark Gillman - Benchmark", "My other volume question relates to the African liquids. The number continues to be lower than what I would have thought, especially given Dahlia, which should have added materially. The number is essentially flat with the fourth quarter. Were there any PSC related effects that occurred in the first quarter that might have offset the positive impact of Dahlia? ", "Henry Hubble", "You see the new -- as we point out, we feel very good about the new projects, both Erha and Dahlia had positive impacts relative to prior periods. We do have cumulative effects of entitlements, and that is not always associated with current price rises. You also are meeting tranches as you go through, as you know, with these, as you accumulate to get to cost current position in various contracts and so on. So that is also impacting, it was about 70 a day in Africa associated with those kinds of effects. ", "Then there is also maintenance and reliability, improvement activities that are going on in the period as well. But the projects, just back to the bottom line, the projects are all performing very well and we feel very, very good about them. ", "The other point I would make too is when you look at entitlement effect and impacts in general on PSCs, and they are all a reflection of positive things. It is either better performance, higher prices, all basically delivering higher returns for those projects. ", "Operator", "We will go next to Mark Flannery with Credit Suisse. ", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "We\u2019ve heard a couple of people this quarter talk about the difficulty in meeting benchmark refining margins or the impacts from lower spreads here on the refining business. I have a two-part question; first is what is your comment with regard to Exxon on that? Secondly, can you split out refining and marketing, either indicatively or with a number for both the U.S. and international? ", "Henry Hubble", "I do not really have a split for you on refining and marketing earnings overall. I can tell you that if you look at the margin impacts associated in the first quarter versus first quarter, which is the biggest component in the change, there is about two-thirds of that associated with rising marketing margins and about a third of that associated with refining margins, to just give you a feel. ", "In terms of the margins that we saw overall though, we continue to process, of course take advantage of the optimization capabilities and the crude flexibility that we have, so we have not really seen something I would attribute to a major offset associated with mark or benchmark crude issues. ", "We are constantly optimizing the crude we are running and making sure that we are getting the runs with the best margin into our facilities, so I cannot really point to anything there that I would say was an issue. ", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "We will go next to Oswald Clint with Sanford Bernstein. ", "Oswald Clint - Sanford Bernstein", "Good morning. Just one question on divestments, please. Is it possible just to give a little bit of [insight] on the cash for the seals of subsidiaries in the quarter, if that was primarily the upstream, and if we would expect continued divestments through the rest of the year, and for that number to step up? ", "Henry Hubble", "If you look at the overall impact of divestments, they are small. They are down relative year on year, and -- I guess on a quarter-to-quarter basis about flat but down versus where we had been averaging in the prior periods. I would just say that that\u2019s more of a reflection of we have a certain, we have a level of ongoing activity. We are constantly looking at assets, whether they are worth more to others than they are to us in the marketplace. I would tell you that we have worked through a bit of an inventory of mature facilities here, so I would see us more at a lower ongoing rate, but nothing else really to focus there. We continue to focus on managing those assets to generate long-term shareholder value and maximizing the value on high-grading our portfolio. ", "Oswald Clint - Sanford Bernstein", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question will come from Paul Cheng with Lehman Brothers. ", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Two simple questions; one, in your press release you are saying you are down 2.8% year over year, but excluding the PSC sales and the OPEC quota, you are up about 1%. Do you have a breakdown? That is a downturn of roughly about 4%. Is it evenly split on those three factors or one is weighted more heavily than the other? ", "Henry Hubble", "Entitlements are the biggest single factor in there, and that was about -- it actually was the bulk of it, 115 associated with that, or KOEDs associated with that. And then if you look at the others, they are about evenly split between the two, quotas and divestments. ", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Can you give us an update; how is the Piceance basin, the fast drilling. How is that program? Is there any change in your target in terms of reaching roughly about 400 million cubic feet per day by the 2010, 2011 timeframe? ", "Also, if I can sneak in one quick one, what is the price finalization impact in the quarter? ", "Henry Hubble", "The price finalization effects, if you look on a total absolute basis, they were very small. I think it is like 10 for the entire company, so it is really, really small. ", "Looking at -- on the Piceance, basically there is no change to our plans but things are progressing there well and as you may know, we did have approval from Bureau of Land Management, or at least a finding of no significant impact on the progression of the projects, so we are looking at that and moving ahead. And the results, drilling results are all very positive and the technology, as you know, that we are deploying there with both fast drill and the multi-zone stimulation technology also performing very well, so it is all go. ", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "What is the current production rate? ", "Henry Hubble", "It is about 50. We basically will be adding in as we bring these additional projects on. ", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Henry, should we assume that it is sort of like a linear function, that to grow for the next several years to reach the 400, or there is more need towards the back-end? ", "Henry Hubble", "No, there is capacity -- gas handling capacity has got to be brought on and that will have some step associated with it. But you know, we have laid it out, our plans in the F&O, and that is probably the best guidance I can give you. ", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Very good. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Herrlin with Merrill Lynch. ", "John Herrlin - Merrill Lynch", "Getting back to the Piceance, I believe with the approval from the BLM, they are talking or Exxon is planning 20 pads with nine wells. Is that all going to be done this year? ", "Henry Hubble", "No, it will be over a period of time. I do not have a breakdown of exactly what the timeframe is. ", "John Herrlin - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, that\u2019s fine. Speaking of the F&O, I was surprised to see the lower tertiary mentioned in the Gulf of Mexico. Exxon has never really been a big deepwater Gulf of Mexico player. Is that something that\u2019s of greater interest these days? ", "Henry Hubble", "Well, as you know, we have several prospects that we are -- we have a lot of acreage in the area and we have several prospects that we are looking at. We have the Julia well that was drilled earlier and we have two more prospects that will be drilled though later in the summer in the fourth quarter. When we bring the Erik Raude down, that will be doing that drilling. ", "So we have a number of plays in the area and acreage throughout the area. ", "John Herrlin - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks, Henry. ", "Operator", "We will go next to Ron Oster with A.G. Edwards. ", "Ron Oster - A.G. Edwards", "I have a couple of quick questions. First, I was wondering if you could give us an update on Gorgon with regard to where you stand on contracts and securing the sales agreements, and any update in terms of the timing of the project that you might be able to provide. ", "Henry Hubble", "Well, as you know, we are not operating that project. Chevron is. That is probably better directed to them on the timing. But we continue to work with the operator. We are going through the process of looking at basically the best path of execution there, or concept of development, and so that is where our focus is. We are working with the operator on it. ", "As far as sales contracts, we continue to look in the market but we are not in any particular rush on that at this point. ", "Ron Oster - A.G. Edwards", "Just one follow-up on the chemical segment, this tends to be a hard area to project, given the integrative nature of your assets. Historically, it has been all over the map but recently it has averaged in the area of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion over the last few quarters. I was just wondering if you could comment if this has been a pretty normal operating margin environment and if this might be a good base case to use going forward? ", "Henry Hubble", "I am not going to give you a forward projection on earnings. It is a cyclical business, and as you have no doubt seen in our results, it also has many cycles within the main cycles, depending on what is going on in price movements, feedstock price movements and people\u2019s buying patterns, so we often see shifts in that in the buying patterns in the Asia-Pac area. ", "But if you step back and you look at our business, we have strength right across in our chemicals business and it starts from the integration that you mentioned with the refineries and our upstream, so we look for advantage feedstocks. We have very close integration with molecule management and others. We have a very strong portfolio of products -- both specialty and commodity, and those specialty products you\u2019ll see will provide us with an up-lift in our returns and a stability associated with our returns because they are a more stable margin and volume business. ", "In the current timeframe, which I would have to say are more peak-like conditions, aromatics have been doing very well, our commodities business has been very strong throughout this period. But it is cyclical. ", "Ron Oster - A.G. Edwards", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Gene Pisasale with Mercantile Capital, your line is open. Please go ahead. ", "Gene Pisasale - Mercantile Capital", "Henry, great quarter. The question that you answered earlier is really more of a follow-up for me, and that is the sourcing of purchased crude around the world, one of your competitors seemed to have had a little bit of a glitch from sourcing somewhat higher-priced crude at the expense of their first quarter margins versus some potentially lower-priced crude. ", "I wonder if you could just talk about how flexible you are on an operational and a strategy basis for purchased crude around the world, or if you want to maybe talk about a specific region where you may be more flexible than others. Because Brent seems to be trading at quite a bit higher than what it typically trades at versus WTI, and that has been a surprise to some people. ", "Henry Hubble", "We manage our supply and our crude purchasing business on a global basis and the organization is constantly focused with the refining organizations to be able to optimize those crude purchases and sales, so you will see us selling out crude that we produce because we can get higher value for it, buying additional grades and constantly managing that with a focus on new crudes to refineries where we see advantages in those, advantaged or lower cost crudes, whether it is high sulfur. ", "Of course, the whole molecule management system that you have heard us talk about before does provide us with capabilities of better planning and estimating the value of various crudes into our refineries, such that we are able to make these decisions very rapidly. So we are constantly optimizing it and maintain that approach. ", "But it is basically a very important piece of our business and globally optimized. ", "Gene Pisasale - Mercantile Capital", "Thanks very much, great quarter. ", "Operator", "We will go now to Mark Gillman of Benchmark. ", "Mark Gillman - Benchmark", "I wonder if you could comment on a couple of upstream factors that might influence the overseas result, which was lower than what we were looking for. Were there any U.K. mark-to-market gas contract impact in terms of the first quarter? Were there any lifting issues relative to production that impacted results in the first quarter? Finally, any asset sales gains that might have distorted comparisons, looking back at either the year-ago or the fourth quarter? ", "Henry Hubble", "In terms of the liftings and patterns around that, really the real big impact was associated with the warmer weather in Europe. If you look at the gas demand there, that was the big piece. You know, we are a big player in Europe, a big gas player in Europe, and you did see and typically see a lot of seasonal variability, so we do end up with a big impact or a significant impact when there is a big swing in the degree day change in the quarter. ", "We saw, if you look quarter on quarter, first quarter versus first quarter, we were down 25% on degree days in that quarterly comparison -- 20% warmer than normal. That was the real big impact for us in the period that I would say was unusual. You also saw that reflecting back through in some of the distillate inventories, as I mentioned earlier. You will see they are quite high in Europe right now. ", "Mark Gillman - Benchmark", "No mark-to-market effects? ", "Henry Hubble", "No, nothing there. ", "Mark Gillman - Benchmark", "Okay, thanks, Henry. ", "Operator", "At this time, we have no other questions standing by on our question roster. I would like to turn the conference back to our speaker for any additional or closing comments. ", "Henry Hubble", "I would just like to thank everybody for tuning in today and for the questions and discussion period that we have had. Thanks again. ", "Operator", "Thank you, everyone, for your participation in today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect at this time.

Bernstein", "Operator", "Good day, everyone, and welcome to this ExxonMobil Corporation Second Quarter 2007 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.", "And at this time for opening remarks, I am pleased to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Henry Hubble. Mr. Hubble, you may begin, sir.", "Henry Hubble", "Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's teleconference and webcast on our second quarter 2007 financial and operating results. As you are aware from this mornings press release, our integrated business model delivered another strong quarter including record second quarter earnings for our downstream and chemical businesses. The fundamentals of our business are strong and we saw continued good operational performance in the quarter. We also continued our disciplined approach to prudently invest and meet long term demand growth.", "Before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement. Please note that estimates, plans, and projections are forward-looking statements. Actual results including resource recoveries, volume growth, and project outcomes could differ materially due to factors I discuss and factors noted in our SEC filings. Please see factors affecting future results on the Form 8K we furnished this morning which are available through the investor information section of our website.", "Please also see the frequently used terms, the supplements to this mornings press release, and the 2006 financial and operating review on our website. This material defines key terms I will use today, shows ExxonMobil's net interest in specific projects, and includes our SEC Regulation G disclosure.", "Now I'm pleased to turn your attention to the second quarter results. ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings were $10.3 billion, down slightly from the 2006 record second quarter. Earnings per share, however, were up markedly from last year at $1.83 reflecting the strong earnings and the continuing benefits of our ongoing share purchase program. Before I discuss the specific business results, I'd like to share some of our recently achieved milestones.", "In the quarter, we saw first production from our interest in the deepwater Rosa project in Angola Block 17. Rosa's recoverable resources are estimated at 370 million barrels and production capacity is expected to be approximately 150,000 barrels per day. SOX exploration Angola has a 20% interest in the project. On July 19, ExxonMobil majority owned affiliate, Imperial Oil and ExxonMobil Canada announced success in acquiring exploration rights for a large block in the Canadian Beaufort Sea.", "Imperial and ExxonMobil Canada were awarded the exploration license after bidding a work program of $585 million Canadian. The block is over 2,000 square kilometers and is located approximately 120 kilometers offshore in water depths ranging from 60 to 1,200 meters.", "An ExxonMobil subsidiary has also recently awarded an offshore block in New Zealand's latest exploration acreage release. The block which comprises approximately 20,000 square kilometers is located in the great South Basin off the southeastern coast of New Zealand.", "Water depths in the area range from 500 to 1,000 meters. The successful capture of acreage in the Beaufort Sea and offshore New Zealand demonstrates ExxonMobil's global approach to the identification and pursuit of quality hydrocarbon resources and exploration opportunities. We look forward to exploring these attractive and technically challenging areas with the full suite of ExxonMobil capabilities.", "During the quarter several new exploration discoveries were reported in ExxonMobil interest Blocks 31 and 32 offshore Angola. These continued successes attest to the resource potential of these blocks and the development options continue to be progressed. In the downstream, we continued our feed diversification activities running 29 crudes which were new to individual refineries.", "Additionally, we implemented projects during the quarter to further enhance feed flexibility. ExxonMobil's ability to rapidly assess and optimally process feedstocks utilizing our proprietary molecular management technology is a key competitive advantage which enables us to maximize the value of a broad range of feedstocks. We also completed the start up of new low sulfur gas facilities in Japan.", "These facilities allow more efficient production of low sulfur gasoline while improving operational flexibility. These projects were completed in line with budget and on or ahead of schedule.", "In June, we announced the worldwide introduction of Mobil Pegasus 1005, a high performance lubricant with advanced additive technology. This new lubricant provides exceptional levels of protection for today's high output, low emissions, natural gas engines. In our chemicals business, we announced the planned expansion of hydrocarbon fluids capacity at our Antwerp and Singapore facilities.", "The hydrocarbon fluids business includes differentiated products used in a broad range of applications and industrial processes. Antwerp capacity will increase -- be increased by about 10% to 700,000 tons per year, with expected completion by the end of this year. In Singapore, the expansion will add 130,000 tons per year bringing production capacity to over 500,000 tons per year.", "These investments reinforce our commitment to meet customer requirements for differentiated products. During the quarter ExxonMobil chemical also announced the development of technology to support the growing drive for improved automobile fuel efficiency. In Japan, an ExxonMobil affiliate is now producing innovative microporous films for hybrid and electric vehicle lithium ion batteries.", "In the U.S. we announced the planned construction of a facility to manufacture new specialty elastomer compounds that can improve the durability and reduce the weight of tires resulting in improved fuel economy.", "And finally, ExxonMobil Chemical also earned awards for energy efficiency from the American Chemistry Council and from the Industrial Energy Technology Conference hosted by the Energy Systems Laboratory of the Texas A&M university system. This is the 10th consecutive year that the ExxonMobil chemicals has received ACC energy efficiency awards.", "Turning now to the business line results. Upstream earnings in the second quarter were $6 billion. This represents a decrease of $1.2 billion versus the second quarter of 2006, primarily due to reduced worldwide natural gas realizations, lower gains from asset sales, tax effects including the absence of positive tax impacts in 2006, and increased expenses primarily due to new project developments.", "These negative effects were partially offset by positive sales mix impacts. Worldwide crude realizations were $65.11 per barrel, up $0.21 per barrel from second quarter 2006. Upstream after-tax unit earnings in the second quarter of 2007 remain strong at $15.88 per barrel. In total, oil equivalent volumes were down 1% from 2006. However, excluding the impact of entitlement, OPEC quota and divestment effects, second quarter production was actually up almost 4%. That increase was driven by increased volumes for major project ramp ups in Russia, West Africa, and Qatar, which more than offset natural field decline and lower European natural gas demand.", "Turning to liquids production. Although increased volumes from the recent project start-ups in Russia, West Africa, and Qatar more than offset natural field decline, liquids production fell by 34,000 barrels per day, or 1% from the same quarter last year due to entitlement and OPEC quota effects in Africa. Gas volumes were essentially unchanged from last year, with lower demand in Europe due to warmer weather and natural field decline offsetting higher production in Qatar.", "Now turning to the sequential comparison. Versus the first quarter of 2007, upstream earnings decreased about $90 million with seasonally lower natural gas volumes, reduced earnings from asset sales, and negative tax effects more than offsetting higher realizations. Liquids production decreased 3%, including the impact of entitlement and quota effects in Africa and plant field maintenance in the U.S. and Europe. Natural gas production was down 14%, primarily due to seasonally lower demand in Europe. Oil equivalent volumes were down 7% from the first quarter.", "Finally, in the upstream, as you're aware ExxonMobil's affiliate in Venezuela was not able to reach the agreement on the formation of a mixed enterprise and on June 27, 2007, the government took over our interest in the Serene rural project. ExxonMobil's net investment and Serene rural producing assets is about $750 million. Discussions with the Venezuelan authorities over the compensation to be paid to ExxonMobil have not yet been completed.", "At this time, the net impact of this matter on the corporations consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably estimated. However, we do not expect the resolution to have a material effect on the corporations, operations or financial condition. For further data on regional volumes, please refer to the press release and IR supplement.", "Now let's turn to the downstream results. Downstream earnings were a quarterly record at $3.4 billion, up approximately $910 million from the second quarter last year as the quality of our integrated downstream portfolio allowed us to benefit from the robust industry conditions. Margins improved across the downstream business functions, increasing earnings by $430 million.", "Volume mix effects were positive $190 million, reflecting feedstock flexibility and product optimization programs. These effects more than offset lower refinery throughput associated with the divestment of the Ingolstadt refinery in Germany and higher planned maintenance activity in the U.S. Despite lower U.S. refinery throughput during the quarter, our supply and operating flexibility allowed us to maintain U.S. gasoline production and in fact our year-to-date gasoline production in the U.S. is up 5% versus last year. Other factors increased earnings by $290 million, primarily due to asset sales, including the Ingolstadt refinery divestment.", "Sequentially, second quarter earnings increased by $1.5 billion, reflecting improved global refining margins. Volume mix effects were positive $110 million, as refinery optimization and other volume effects more than offset the impact of planned maintenance activities. Other factors benefited earnings by $110 million, including the positive effects from asset divestments partially offset by higher maintenance costs and foreign exchange effects.", "Chemical earnings were a record for the second quarter at $1 billion, up nearly $175 million versus the second quarter of 2006. Higher margins improved earnings by $215 million reflecting increased realizations partly offset by higher feedstock costs. Sequentially, second quarter chemical earnings were down by $225 million from a strong first quarter, driven by lower worldwide margins.", "Turning now to our corporate and financing segment. The Corporation recorded second quarter expenses of $99 million in the corporate and financing segment, unchanged from the second quarter of 2006. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 44%. The Corporation distributed a total of $9 billion to shareholders in the second quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding, up 14% from the second quarter of 2006.", "During the quarter, ExxonMobil purchased $7 billion of shares in excess of dilution, reducing the number of shares outstanding by 1.5%, and further demonstrating our ongoing commitment to return cash to our shareholders. CapEx in the second quarter was $5 billion. At the end of the second quarter, our cash balance was $33.6 billion and debt was $8.8 billion.", "In summary, these results highlight the fundamental strength of our business, our ability to deliver superior operational performance, and continue to grow our integrated capabilities while continuing to position ourselves for future demand growth and create value for our shareholders.", "That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'd now be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We'll go first to Doug Terreson with Morgan Stanley.", "Doug Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "How are you?", "Henry Hubble", "Hi, Doug.", "Doug Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "In international refining and marketing, your refining production outside of Europe during the first half was higher by almost 5% in relation to the year ago period, which is obviously a good number, but marketing output seemed to be lower versus the same period. And so my question regards why these two figures might be diverging, which I believe represented a feature of the results during the past couple of quarters as well. And so divergence and refining and marketing first half outside of Europe is the question.", "Henry Hubble", "Outside of Europe?", "Doug Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Outside of Europe, yes. Asia and other, basically.", "Henry Hubble", "Okay. Let me just look at what we've got here. There's no real big story here. Most of that, it's turnaround timing and it's going to fluctuate with timing, but I can't really point to a seasonal impact there that's going on either.", "Doug Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Okay. Well, let me ask you another question. At the analyst meeting, Rex talked about the proficiency of the project management system as being one of the explanations why Exxon's actual and funded capital expenditures have been so close in recent years and at 2007 appears to be heading in the same direction.", "Henry Hubble", "Yes.", "Doug Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Which is also good news too. And so on this point, I wanted to see if you could provide an update on some of the inflation trends that the Company is experiencing, because it appears as if you have taken them into consideration in an appropriate way in your operations, and Henry if you have an aggregate or by the major functions, that would be great.", "Henry Hubble", "Yes, I mean, if you just look at overall operating expenses for the Company, there's -- and you look at what we're able to do just -- of course we track this on a regular basis in terms of the various effects, and then how we're able to offset those. If you look at the inflationary effects, basically we've been able for a long period of time to offset inflationary effects with efficiency.", "Doug Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Yes.", "Henry Hubble", "The general drive though that you see in rising costs, there are some associated with new projects and non -- noncash costs associated with new projects. You also have a 4X effect that's in here.", "Doug Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Sure.", "Henry Hubble", "But obviously we're not immune to the impacts of higher costs and we work very hard to offset those. So when you look at the projects, especially in the CapEx area, there's an awful lot of work that goes on in the front end. In fact, that's a big piece of our focus, is to make sure that we have really got the concept of development right, that we've got the execution plans well thought through, the contracting is in place, and then we got to execute according to those plans. And we work very hard. It's not that things don't go wrong, but we have very -- because of the global functional approach that we have to be able to solve problems, we're able to get the right people there very quickly and get those resolved to help us keep on track.", "Doug Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Sure.", "Henry Hubble", "And all of these things end up helping to manage those costs, but they're not silver bullets. It's a lot of hard work by a lot of people. The other thing I would say is technology plays a big factor here too, and many of the things that we have been able to deliver in even in the recent times, whether it's the technology we have around Fast Drill that has allowed us to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our drilling efforts. That has taken anywhere from 15% to 30% out of the cost of wells, which is -- goes a big ways to offset the cost of inflation on drill rigs and other things. So all of that to say, there's just a lot of things that are going on, a lot of people working this very hard, but I'll tell you the other thing that's real key here, in any cost controlling effort, is that you don't start with the goal of reducing cost. You start with a goal to improve things like reliability or efficiency or productivity, and you put in systems that allow you to deliver those. You just don't go cut budgets or you won't get the results you're looking for. Generally, we find improved reliability and improved maintenance practices delivers lower costs and improved throughput.", "Doug Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Well, the system is working. Thanks a lot.", "Henry Hubble", "Yes. Thanks.", "Operator", "Next we'll go to Robert Kessler at Simmons & Company.", "Robert Kessler - Simmons & Company", "Hi, Henry.", "Henry Hubble", "Hi.", "Robert Kessler - Simmons & Company", "Looking at your upstream variant sequentially, the other bucket, over $1 billion, can you just give a little bit more granularity as to the components there?", "Henry Hubble", "Yes. Just stepping back, in both of the comparative periods, we had a large other impact, and if you look into what's behind that, as we highlighted last year and it really is -- we also discussed in the first quarter, we saw a positive earnings impacts associated with asset sales in 2006, including the second quarter. It's really the absence of those sales or reduced number of sales that you see this negative variance and then we also had some positive tax impacts, largely in Canada, that we also got last year in the second quarter. So that -- those -- that combination of those two ends up being about 60% of that $1 billion variance in the other column.", "Robert Kessler - Simmons & Company", "Reading that different, Henry, do we just call the current quarter fairly clean then in that regard?", "Henry Hubble", "Yes, that's right. It's -- you had variations, but there's nothing in the current quarter that's a big negative to these results. I mean, we do see as I mentioned earlier, we do see some expense increases and those expense increases associated largely with new project startups. You also saw some in our exploration activity that reflected in the period, but I would tell you there's nothing there in the way of a significant other variance.", "Robert Kessler - Simmons & Company", "Sure. I appreciate with respect in Venezuela that the full financial impact is not yet estimable. Can you tell us though of the $750 million of PP&E exposure you had to Venezuela previously, how much is still on your books ?", "Henry Hubble", "Well, the $750 million is an all-in effect. So that's I think that's a way to look at that. That's basically all-in what we have on Venezuela from the Serenegro production.", "Robert Kessler - Simmons & Company", "And you have yet to really write-off any of that in the interim?", "Henry Hubble", "No, because we're still in the middle of discussions here , and you're predicting how that's going to turn out and what the net of this issue will be, or effect will be, is -- really can't be determined at this point. So I think it's premature to do anything in that", "Robert Kessler - Simmons & Company", "Okay. Last one for me. This is a quick one but looking at your cash flow from operations of $11.3 billion for the quarter, can you quantify any positive or negative working capital effects buried in there?", "Henry Hubble", "Yes, if you look at cash flow, normally in the comparisons that we have, especially in the first quarter or second quarter, you always have the impacts of -- you have more tax expense, or, excuse me, less tax expense than you have cash payments in the second quarter, because you end up -- we have that opposite effect we talk about in the first quarter when the taxes aren't due until April 15th. So you end up with essentially a double payment in the second quarter and that's the biggest piece of that. You'll see other variations that occur just with variations in pricing that goes on. I think there is a bit in here that may be associated with product receivables but the big impact was on the tax side.", "Robert Kessler - Simmons & Company", "But I'm sorry, in aggregate, last year, second quarter, you had about a $3 billion working capital use of cash. Is that about the same in this year's second quarter?", "Henry Hubble", "Let's see, if I look, the year comparison year on year, it's really almost nothing in there. It's -- they were almost identical.", "Robert Kessler - Simmons & Company", "Right.", "Henry Hubble", "Or had very similar effects.", "Robert Kessler - Simmons & Company", "Fair enough. Thanks, Henry.", "Henry Hubble", "Yes, okay.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Nikki Decker at Bear Stearns.", "Nikki Decker - Bear Stearns & Company", "Hi, Henry.", "Henry Hubble", "Hi, Nikki.", "Nikki Decker - Bear Stearns & Company", "I wanted to ask you about U.S. liquids production. It's lower both sequentially and year-over-year.", "Henry Hubble", "Yes.", "Nikki Decker - Bear Stearns & Company", "Is something going on there?", "Henry Hubble", "Well, no, I would say we tend to look at the liquids in North America, or that's the way I'd generally look at this, and we're down about 4% on the year on year comparisons second quarter '07 to 06, and I would just say there's -- we feel very good about the work programs and overall, the things are on track there. There's -- I mean obviously there's actual field decline and mature areas, but we've been able to partially offset that with actually some pretty strong work programs during the period.", "Nikki Decker - Bear Stearns & Company", "Do the -- liquids production would reflect the natural declines?", "Henry Hubble", "Yes, Oh, yes.", "Nikki Decker - Bear Stearns & Company", "Okay. Secondly, Henry, I think last quarter, you provided a breakdown between refining and marketing on the margin contribution on your earnings comparison. I was wondering if you could do the same.", "Henry Hubble", "Yes. If you just -- if you look, it's about 75% marketing in the margin side, 75% marketing, 25% refining. And just back on your other question about the North America volumes, there are some asset management effects in there too. They aren't real big, but there are some of those that are in that same time frame.", "Nikki Decker - Bear Stearns & Company", "Okay, thanks. Just on your response on the margin question, is that sequentially or year-over-year?", "Henry Hubble", "That was year-over-year.", "Nikki Decker - Bear Stearns & Company", "Would you have it sequentially as well?", "Henry Hubble", "Sequentially, it's all refining. There's basically nothing in there on marketing.", "Nikki Decker - Bear Stearns & Company", "Thanks, Henry.", "Henry Hubble", "Yes.", "Operator", "We'll go to Paul Sankey at Deutsche.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Hi, Henry.", "Henry Hubble", "Hi, Paul.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "How are you?", "Henry Hubble", "Good.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Henry, I was given what you think about project start ups , it's notable that your African oil volumes are down quite heavily year on year. Could you speak specifically to that, and extend it to just break out the -- what were the components, divestments, and so on of the volume differential that you're talking about between the decline and what would have been a 4%", "Henry Hubble", "Right, yes. Well if you look at the number, when I was talking about the 4% increase I was really referring to the oil equivalent comparison in the year on year quarter comparison. Now, the bulk of that as I pointed out was for titlement effects, those were in Africa, associated with the projects that we have there, and it's components, as you know with the PSC's that we have there, we have impacts as we -- or cumulative price effects associated with those entitlement effects over those, and then we also have price impacts. But that was if you looked at it, that was if I just jump down to the total oil equivalent impact, we had -- we were 1% down year on year, and it was about 3% of that that impact associated with entitlements. There was a 1% impact that was associated with quota, and again the big piece of that quota effect was in Africa, and then there were divestment impacts, but they are obviously outside of Africa in the U.S. and non-U.S. And ended up being about another .5%, but that's where -- how you get to the 4%. And if you look at the Africa volumes themselves, and it's basically, again, it's the entitlement effects and the quota effects there, which were the big pieces of that. And that was offset by the new project volumes that we brought on that ended up partially offset by the new volumes we brought on.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "And is that situation in Africa particularly with the cutbacks on OPEC changing, Henry? Are you producing more now or is it still ratcheted back?", "Henry Hubble", "Well, I don't know. To current day, yes, but if you look at what the impact will be on the quarter, it's hard to say what's going to evolve from here on that front.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "But basically back at a similar level of cut back right now that we saw in the Q2?", "Henry Hubble", "It would be less currently today.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "That's interesting, thank you. The second question if I could, we were surprised by your realizations in European gas. We know about the seasonal volume effect obviously, but it's interesting that there was a really significant step down on the realization side. Could you talk about that?", "Henry Hubble", "Well, you see just with the warm weather in Europe, we did see downward pressures on realizations there, and if you look at the natural gas, if you look at like the -- you don't really have the equivalent of markers, but if you look at the UK net balancing point, it was down sharply across the time frame, and we saw some of that roll through into impacts in Europe in particular. So you kind of have an issue here where, in the U.S, natural gas actually increased during the period, about 11%, and over there we saw a 14% decline in our realizations, and really reflecting warmer weather and in fact there were even periods where there were arbitrage opens going across, so we did see weakness in the European gas pricing.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, so it was essentially just related to the headline -- the marker being down. It was nothing like no special items in there that would cause it to be unusually low?", "Henry Hubble", "No, other than we had, there was less demand associated with the warm weather.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Sure.", "Henry Hubble", "And however that rolls back through into price, yes. That was there, but nothing else, no.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Right, and finally for me, U.S. refining, it seems to me you got an 82% utilization rate in Q -- the first half. Is that going to improve do you think in the second half, and you mentioned it was related to plant turnarounds? It seems like an awfully low number or very high level of turnaround. Was there some additional issues there? Thank you.", "Henry Hubble", "Well, if you look at the turnaround impacts and the throughput impacts that we had in the quarterly comparison, we're down about 128 I think in North America or in the U.S, And that was essentially all turnaround, both Beaumont and Baytown. And they were pipe turnarounds, so you see that in throughput but we were actually because we didn't have as much conversion capacity down, we had more of our CAT units and other conversion units up and running, we were actually able to increase our gasoline production in this time frame. So what we've done is buy feedstocks to be able to keep those units full and we're able to maintain our production.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Right, and your '06 number U.S. utilization was 90%. Is that what we can expect to see in the second half?", "Henry Hubble", "We'll have less turnaround activity scheduled in the second half.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks, Henry.", "Henry Hubble", "Yes.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Doug Leggate with Citigroup.", "Doug Leggate - Citigroup", "Thank you. Good morning, Henry.", "Henry Hubble", "Hi, Doug.", "Doug Leggate - Citigroup", "International downstream, notwithstanding the sequential and year-over-year comparisons that you've given us, if you look at the realized earnings in that segment and adjust for the gain, I guess, coming from the refinery disposal that the counter rates still look pretty impressive. Can you just talk around that and has there been anything specific going on? Have you changed to feedstock, or is there something unusual there that has pushed your earnings up?", "Henry Hubble", "Nothing that I can really point to. There's obviously in all of these periods a lot of emphasis on selecting the right raw materials and getting them into the refineries, and we do a lot as we talked about to get advantage feedstocks or advantage crudes into those refineries. And one of the things that we find is gives us an advantage in that is, we have with our molecule management technology, we're able to quickly assess the value of new raw materials and assess those values into our facilities. And that helps with our optimization, but there's nothing else I can really point to, other than kind of the normal good operations and good reliability that we've had in the period.", "Doug Leggate - Citigroup", "Can you break out the absolute contribution from the English stock disposal?", "Henry Hubble", "I don't have a specific number associated, but about 3 -- about 3 -- $300,000 -- $300 million.", "Doug Leggate - Citigroup", "Okay, and the only other one for me is if I could just jump back to Venezuela very quickly, obviously your -- one of your competitors took a fairly sizeable write-off in Venezuela yesterday. You folks have decided not to do that, but arguably, it's difficult to know how it's going to play out. But I'm just curious when you think about it from a prudent standpoint, why have you opted not yet to take that hit, given that it's relatively modest in any case?", "Henry Hubble", "Well, the -- I think both argue for not -- it's modest and overall sense, it's important, but we're in the middle of discussions and until you can estimate it, reasonably estimate what the impact is, if you follow, we follow GAAP rules and frankly, our view is you can't really estimate it until we're a little further down the road on these negotiations. And so we just don't think that it's appropriate timing to do that.", "Doug Leggate - Citigroup", "Okay, great. Thanks, Henry.", "Henry Hubble", "Yes.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We'll move to Mark Gilman at Benchmark.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "Henry, good morning.", "Henry Hubble", "Hi, Mark, how are you?", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "Good, thank you. Quick update on quality, if you can?", "Henry Hubble", "Update on --", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "The following --", "Henry Hubble", "Oh, sorry. Yes. Basically, we had a fire at our -- you may have obviously heard about it, on the Cogent facility there, where we lost steam and some of the power production, basically ended upbringing the facility down. Right now, we're working on the plans and in fact the plans have been developed for restart and we're expecting that to happen over the next several days. So it's one of those -- you had a down time, but no long lasting damage as we've assessed it.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "Okay, do you have a hard number for your next Serenegro production in the second quarter?", "Henry Hubble", "I don't have a -- it's about 30%, because we had quota effects, we had some quota effects in there, so actually I think it's a little less than that, 20%, about 20%.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "About 20%?", "Henry Hubble", "Yes.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "Yes, I notice that in your variance analysis on the upstream. The volume is indicated to be a modest plus in the year-over-year comparison, whereas production was down. Does that mean that there were favorable lifting variances in this years second quarter?", "Henry Hubble", "Well, what you see there is really the effects of the positive -- we had a positive impact associated with new volumes that we're bringing on in the Middle East, as well as in Russia associated with the ramp up production there, and being able to export those volumes. So we had some positive mix effects associated with that.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "Okay, and final one for me, there's reference in the release to Canadian gas production and project that ramped that up a little bit. Wasn't aware of anything in that regard. Could you be a bit more specific?", "Henry Hubble", "Oh, that's associated with Sabel.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "Oh, okay.", "Henry Hubble", "Bringing that. Yes.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "Okay, thanks, Henry.", "Henry Hubble", "Yes, yes, no problem.", "Operator", "Next we'll take a question from Dan Barcelo with Banc of America.", "Daniel Barcelo - Banc of America Securities", "Hi, good morning, Henry.", "Henry Hubble", "Hi, Dan.", "Daniel Barcelo - Banc of America Securities", "Just a clarification regarding upstream.", "Henry Hubble", "Yes.", "Daniel Barcelo - Banc of America Securities", "Q2 versus Q1, and it related to two aspects. First U.S. realization seemed to be really light compared to Henry Hub benchmarks. Does that have to do with rocky differentials or things like that? And the second part is related to an earlier question, if you could give some color on the $620 million swing in other, related again from Q2 to Q1 in the upstream.", "Henry Hubble", "Yes. When you look at the other impacts, as I mentioned, you do have -- there's a whole bunch of items in there, but they are basically all going in the same direction again in this time frame. So we have a number of effects. Basically, again, it's the absence of some positive impacts from the first quarter including the asset sales and some positive tax impacts. And there were also some higher activity related to exploration, and we also had some -- a little additional in there in operating expenses and 4X impacts. But nothing else that I really can highlight. And then the other piece of the question was around --", "Daniel Barcelo - Banc of America Securities", "Henry Hub differential -- Henry Hub change 1Q to 2Q versus your realization, you were broadly flat. I think the benchmark went up to about $0.78. Is that related more to differentials and your position --", "Henry Hubble", "It's going to be related to the specific contracts. Typically we track pretty close. There isn't anything I can point to that was a specific issue there, so it's -- we've generally tracked that reasonably close. If you look at I think we had Henry Hub was our average would show $7.55 in the quarter and versus last or sequential quarter, $6.77 and we were at $6 versus, excuse me, U.S. we were $6.94 versus the $6.85. So I guess that's, it is a variance there, but I really can't point to anything specific.", "Daniel Barcelo - Banc of America Securities", "Okay, and then second one if I could was just maybe a broader comment on your deepwater U.S. Gulf strategy, both in the context of maybe lease expirations, upcoming lease sales. But it's also interesting because I understand you're bringing a rig down from Canada that was at Walker Ridge. And then last year you did something interesting with Statoil and AMI and Walker Ridge.", "Henry Hubble", "Right. Yes. We've got, if you look at the lower tertiary, we've got a number of -- we already drilled the Julia well as you're no doubt aware. We're bringing the rod down from -- or it's actually down I guess now, to drill the North Braun in fact it's drilling now, and then we'll be using it also to drill Hal later in the year, and then we also have Chuck that is being drilled in the time frame. So all has impacted is it's being drilled now as well so there's a fair bit of activity and those are prospects -- the best prospects that we see. There is some acreage that will be released in that area and we'll be evaluating what we want to do there.", "Daniel Barcelo - Banc of America Securities", "Okay, thank you.", "Henry Hubble", "Yes.", "Operator", "We'll go to Paul Cheng at Lehman -- Lehman Brothers, rather. Sorry.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Hi, Henry. Good morning.", "Henry Hubble", "Hi, Paul.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Two quick questions. I think based on what you just described earlier, that in this particular quarter we do not have any major impact one way or the other from inventory gain tax adjustment or foreign exchange?", "Henry Hubble", "Yes. We have foreign exchange is kind of minor impacts, but if I look at just the total, you end up in the second quarter, the year on year comparison, second quarter to second quarter, there's a positive $77 million of that in chemicals and then if you look at sequentially, it's a negative impact of about $50 million, but pretty small across the businesses. And that's from a 4X standpoint.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Yes, how about in terms of inventory gain on laws or tax --", "Henry Hubble", "No, the only we really you don't see, we don't see any inventory effects other than at year-end associated with LIFO.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Yes. Okay. And cats, what kind of impact are you guys -- and also can you talk about what is the asset sales gain for the German refinery?", "Henry Hubble", "I don't have a quick number off the top on the cats impact. I can -- we can get something for you on that, but it's relatively small.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Relatively small?", "Henry Hubble", "Yes.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "And then how about in terms of the asset sales gain you record --", "Henry Hubble", "What was that again?", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "The asset sales gain you record for the German refinery you sold?", "Henry Hubble", "Oh, yes, that was Ingolstadt of about $300 million.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "$300 million?", "Henry Hubble", "$300 million, yes, and the cats impact is about 40 million.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "40,000 or 40 million cubic feet?", "Henry Hubble", "40 million cubic feet.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Wow, only?", "Henry Hubble", "Yes.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "You guys are in good shape.", "Henry Hubble", "Yes.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, thank you.", "Henry Hubble", "Yes.", "Operator", "And we'll take a question from Kate Lucas at JPMorgan.", "Kate Lucas - JPMorgan Chase & Company", "Hi, good morning.", "Henry Hubble", "Hi, Kate.", "Kate Lucas - JPMorgan Chase & Company", "Hi. Just a quick question on your chemical segment. We've seen pretty strong results over the last several quarters and you've had -- you've got some organic growth projects. But I just wanted to know if you might be giving any consideration to expanding the weighting of chemicals in your overall portfolio, maybe beyond the organic projects that you've approved for project start-up?", "Henry Hubble", "Well, as you -- well, we have a number of projects that are aimed at growing, basically aimed at the Asia Pacific market. So we have a project in Fujian that we're executing now. We're working on the Singapore parallel train and looking forward to bringing that one not too far down the road, and of course we also have the project in joint venture project in Wusavec and Saudi Arabia, and then we're working with Qatar, all of these will be world class facilities. So, yes, we're growing this business, and it's one where -- as we look at it, it grows about 2%, or better than 2% above GDP growth, and it's really driven because of the continuing substitution into automobile parts and textiles, and other things. So we see a strong demand growth there, and really, in that Asia Pacific area is the big piece. So, yes, we're working that and then also, of course our big focus in this in how we approach it is with a strong integration to our downstream businesses or to advantage feedstocks and with our upstream assets. So, yes, we're positioning ourselves to grow and meet the organic or the larger growth that's coming.", "Kate Lucas - JPMorgan Chase & Company", "Thank you.", "Henry Hubble", "Yes.", "Operator", "Next we'll go to John Herrlin with Merrill Lynch.", "John Herrlin - Merrill Lynch", "Yes, Henry, European gas sales were weak. You mentioned that the cast line would be out for a little bit volume wise in the prior question.", "Henry Hubble", "Yes.", "John Herrlin - Merrill Lynch", "What kind of sequential recovery are you seeing with respect to gas or should we expect more weakness in the third quarter in Europe?", "Henry Hubble", "Well, the big piece in sequential comparison is just the normal seasonal demand. So it typically, we see in the third quarter, it's not all that different than what we typically have in the second quarter, and then it starts picking up fourth quarter and first quarter. So I would -- it's going to be dominated by those seasonal impacts and I would expect it to be not all that different.", "John Herrlin - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Next one for me is on chemicals, we've been getting a lot of weak economic data. Are your folks seeing any issues with respect to product demand on your chemical business?", "Henry Hubble", "Not really. We're running utilizations, we're running our plants full, so that's been strong. We've seen strong solid demand globally. The areas in our aeromatics have been strong in the period and we've seen good. So basically, strength through the business and don't really see that changing quickly here. It's in a good position, as long as we see good global demand growth --", "John Herrlin - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you.", "Henry Hubble", "All right", "Operator", "Next we'll take a follow-up from Mark Gilman.", "Henry Hubble", "All right", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "Henry, I know there's rate of return thresholds in the PSC 's for Kizamba A and B. I was wondering whether Kiz B has hit that threshold which would result in a reduction in the profit split?", "Henry Hubble", "Well, there -- as you know, we don't get into the specifics of the contracts on those things. There are, as you know, there's a couple of components of PSC's, those that are affected with cumulative entitlement effects that are associated with cost recovery, and those associated with the profit-sharing, and their -- both of those effects are in those entitlement numbers you're seeing there.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "Let me try it differently. All things being equal, is there another step down further down in the life of either Kiz A or Kiz B that we should be aware of going forward?", "Henry Hubble", "Well, these projects they have a more traditional offshore profile for production and they have -- they do have effects associated with them as you basically go to different tranches in the cost recovery. So -- yes, that will mean -- there will be some future impacts.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "Okay, thanks, Henry.", "Operator", "Yes. And we'll go next to Neil McMahon at Sanford Bernstein.", "Neil McMahon - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Hi, I've got a few questions. The first, maybe Henry, just a quick, if you've got the number, idea of the earnings impact from all divestments, not just Ingolstadt, like you said a number of things like $300 million, just wondering what the overall number is. And then I've got a few questions on exploration.", "Henry Hubble", "Yes. And I'll -- let me look and see what I've got here. If you look at Ingolstadt, it really wasn't a whole lot outside that was significant. You ended up -- so I really don't have anything else to kind of point at there. That was the biggest single piece.", "Neil McMahon - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Okay. Maybe just the exploration questions. Your exploration expense on top of it from the first quarter and it sort of is running along the lines of fourth quarter numbers when it tends to be sort of back-end loaded. Geographically, was that Gulf of Mexico, North America or international where you were seeing that?", "Henry Hubble", "Well, I mean, a lot of it is what you see is it's a timing of big wells and specific timing of the recognition of some -- whatever dry holes were in the period. So I really couldn't point to -- I mean we have a broad slate of activity going on around the globe, as you know, and it was really not a specific area that was the big chunk of that. So you got some seismic activity in there, you've got drilling and dry hole expenses that were reflected in the period. But I guess just stepping back from it all, I mean, we do have a very active exploration program, and it's -- if you look around the globe, with Columbia, things we have going on in Brazil, Orphan, the -- now work on the Beaufort Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Tertiary, Piance, Ireland, Norway, UK North Sea high, activities in Africa, AP. So there's just a lot of activity going on around the world. And so a lot of these, there will be expenses associated with those.", "Neil McMahon - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Just on that actually, I think the big wells you've got coming up have more to do in the Orphan next year.", "Henry Hubble", "Yes.", "Neil McMahon - Sanford C. Bernstein", "But you've got Columbia. Has the Columbia well started drilling yet offshore?", "Henry Hubble", "No, not yet.", "Neil McMahon - Sanford C. Bernstein", "And then I think you've got Madagascar next year?", "Henry Hubble", "Yes. Columbia will be later this year.", "Neil McMahon - Sanford C. Bernstein", "My question is mainly, I saw you got into New Zealand.", "Henry Hubble", "Yes, yes.", "Neil McMahon - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Through the quarter. Where does that, since this is as you've probably the most remote wild cat you're going to drill ever, why does that rank up there with the big opportunities in Madagascar and the Beaufort Sea, and in terms of the way you're looking at new basins?", "Henry Hubble", "Well, we're going to be going through obviously to get the seismic first, so we've got basically planning under way to get the 2D and whatever 3D seismic data there. And then what it's going to take from there we'll make the decision after that. It's like a lot of these, they tend to be, they're plays that we think have high potential but they high risk or technically challenging in many of these areas. So I wouldn't want to put it in the characterization versus some of these others. It's obviously one that we think there's -- we have interest in and want to pursue.", "Neil McMahon - Sanford C. Bernstein", "So basically for our models running forward we might want to assume a bit higher exploration expense in the current rig rate environment, and the riskiness of some of these big high reward, high risk --", "Henry Hubble", "Yes, it's going to be variable, and we've -- we update that on kind of on a yearly basis, and we'll be reflecting what our best view of that is as we come up to the next round.", "Neil McMahon - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Henry Hubble", "All right, very good.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Hubble, I'll turn it back to you for any additional or closing remarks.", "Henry Hubble", "I just would like to thank everybody for joining us today and appreciate the questions. If you have any others or areas that you would like to pursue, please don't hesitate to give us a call. Thanks.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's teleconference.

Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Nicole Decker - Bear Stearns", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Katherine Lucas - J P Morgan", "Oswald Clint - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Doug Leggate - Citigroup", "Operator", "Good day everyone and welcome to this Exxon Mobil Corporation Fourth Quarter 2007 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary Mr. Henry Hubble. Please go ahead sir.", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "Good morning and welcome to ExxonMobil's teleconference and webcast on our fourth quarter and full year 2007 financial and operating results. As you are aware from this morning's press release, we had another strong quarter. In an environment of robust commodity prices, our fourth quarter results again highlight the fundamental strength of our business. We continue to deliver superior operational performance and leverage our integrated capabilities, while investing at record levels in an industry-leading portfolio of projects to bring supplies to market.", "Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement. Please note that estimates, plans, and projections are forward-looking statements. Actual results, including resource recoveries, volume growth and project outcomes, could differ materially due to the factors I discussed and factors noted in our SEC filings. Please see factors affecting future results and the Form 8-K, we furnished this morning, which are available through the Investors Section of our website.", "Please also see the frequently used terms, the supplements to this morning's press release and the 2006 financial and operating review on our website. This material defines key terms I will use today, shows ExxonMobil's net interest in specific projects and includes our SEC Regulation G disclosure. Now I'm pleased to turn your attention to the fourth quarter results.", "ExxonMobil's fourth quarter 2007 normalized earnings and net income were a record for the corporation, at $11.7 billion, up to $2.3 billion from the third quarter of this year, versus the fourth quarter of 2006, net income increased $1.4 billion and normalized earnings were up $1.8 billion. Fourth quarter normalized earnings per share were $2.13, up 26% from the year ago, reflecting the strength of our financial performances and the benefits of our ongoing share repurchase program. ExxonMobil's net income and normalized earnings for 2007 totaled $40.6 billion, also a record for the Corporation. Normalized earnings were up $1.5 billion from 2006, while net income increase $1.1 billion.", "Before I discuss the specific business results, I would like to share with you some milestones achieved since our last earnings call. Starting with our Upstream business. In October, we achieved initial oil production from the first expansion of the Tengiz development in Kazakhstan. When complete, this expansion project, Tengiz Phase 1, will fully incorporate a second-generation gas handling project with sour gas injection. The project is expected to deliver incremental production of 285,000 barrels of oil per day at full capacity. This was ExxonMobil's seventh major Upstream project startup in 2007.", "In January, we started up production from the Mondo field in the ExxonMobil-operated Kizomba C development, in Block 15 offshore Angola. The Kizomba C development exemplifies ExxonMobil's design one, build multiple' strategy as it includes two projects; Mondo and Saxi/Batuque. Each project utilizes a floating production storage and off-loading vessel that will handle up to a 100,000 barrels per day. Together these projects are expected to recover 600 million barrels of oil. We anticipate the start-up of Saxi and Batuque fields later this year, completing the Kizomba C development. These project start-ups demonstrate ExxonMobil's commitment to bring new energy supplies to market and deliver value to our shareholders.", "Also in the fourth quarter, we announced plans to seek regulatory approval for our BlueOcean Energy project. This project includes a floating LNG receiving terminal, 20 miles off the coast of New Jersey and will have the capacity to supply about 1.2 billion cubic feet of clean burning natural gas per day to help meet the growing energy needs of consumers in New York and New Jersey.", "During the fourth quarter, we also signed a heads of agreement with Libya's National Oil Corporation to execute an exploration and production sharing agreement. The agreement includes four blocks located in the Sirte Basin, approximately110 miles off the Libyan coast. The contract area comprises 2.5 million acres in water depths ranging from 5400 feet to more than 8700 feet. The work program includes 2D and 3D seismic and one deepwater exploration well. The contract award is expected to be ratified by the Libyan government earlier this year. This further adds to our industry-leading portfolio of exploration opportunities around the world.", "In our Downstream business, we also had a number of notable achievements in the fourth quarter. ExxonMobil's Baton Rouge refinery received the 2007 ENERGY STAR Award from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This award recognizes our achievements in reducing energy consumption at the facility and our continuing efforts to improve energy efficiency in our operations.", "We continue to grow profitability at our refineries through our molecule-management technology and our ongoing crude diversification efforts. In the fourth quarter, we ran 43 crudes new to individual refineries and five new to ExxonMobil.", "In our lubes business, we announced that ExxonMobil will become the titled sponsor of the Penske Racing Number 77 Mobil 1 Dodge in the 2008 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. Mobil 1 is the official motor oil of NASCAR and is used by more than 60% of the racing teams. This reflects the exceptional performance and protection that Mobil 1 provides, even under the most extreme conditions and our continued commitment to developing innovative high-quality products.", "In our shipping business, both of ExxonMobil's maritime affiliates, SeaRiver Maritime in the U.S. and International Marine Transportation in the U.K were again awarded the British Safety Council's Sword of Honor. As the Council's top recognition, the prestigious award highlights the exceptional quality of our people, the effectiveness of our processes and systems, and our continuous efforts to further improve safety performance.", "ExxonMobil also achieved a number of milestones in our Chemical business in the fourth quarter. In December, we announced the development of new film technologies for lithium-ion batteries. These technologies have the potential to improve the energy efficiency and affordability of next-generation hybrid and electric vehicles by significantly enhancing the power, safety and reliability of lithium-ion batteries.", "Through our Japanese affiliate, Tonen Chemical, we also signed a Memorandum of Understanding to progress a feasibility study with the construction and operation of a battery manufacturing facility in Gumi, South Korea. We look forward to working with automakers and battery manufacturers on implementing these technologies and addressing the challenges in producing the next-generation of low-emissions vehicles.", "In the quarter, ExxonMobil Chemical started up a new compounding facility at our integrated complex in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. This achievement, along with formation of our new business lines dedicated to specialty compound and composites, is part of our commitment to the development, production and marketing of engineered polyolefin compounds around the world. This world-class facility at Baton Rouge, will further enhance ExxonMobil's capability to supply high-performance products to the automotive, appliance and specialty consumer products industries. These developments highlight our ongoing commitment to advancing technological innovation across all of our business lines.", "Now turning to the business-line results. Upstream earnings in the fourth quarter were a record at $8.2 billion, up $2 billion from the fourth quarter of 2006. We continued to capture the benefit of strong industry conditions, this quarter with Upstream after-tax unit earnings, up $20.97 per barrel. Higher crude oil and natural gas realizations drove the majority of the earnings increase, with worldwide crude oil realizations up $29 per barrel from fourth quarter 2006.", "Volume and mix effects were negative, as lower crude oil volumes and mix effects more than offset increased natural gas volumes. Other effects reduced earnings by $600 million, primarily due to negative tax impacts and higher operating expenses, including the effect of newfield start-ups. These were partially offset by positive earnings from assets sales.", "Oil equivalent volumes increased nearly 1% versus the same quarter last year, driven by higher natural gas demand in Europe. Excluding the Venezuela expropriation, divestments, quotas and price and spend impacts on volumes, production was up nearly 3%. The increase in European natural gas demand combined with major project ramp ups in Russia, West Africa, Qatar and the North Sea, more than offset natural fuel decline in the PSC net interest productions.", "Liquids production decreased about 160,000 barrels per day versus the same quarter last year, as natural fuel decline in mature areas and PSC net interest reductions more than offset the impact of major project ramp ups in Russia and West Africa. Gas volumes increased approximately 1.1 billion cubic feet per day, were 12% versus the fourth quarter of 2006. New project volumes in Qatar and the North Sea and higher demand due to colder weather in Europe, were partly offset by natural fuel decline in mature areas.", "Turning now to the sequential comparison; versus the third quarter of 2007, Upstream earnings increased by $1.9 billion. Higher realizations increased earnings by $1.6 billion, driven by an almost $14 per barrel increase in crude oil prices. Volume and mix effects were also positive, due to higher natural gas volumes. Oil equivalent volumes were up nearly 9% from the third quarter, due to seasonally higher natural gas demand in Europe.", "Looking now at the full year results. 2007 Upstream earnings were a record $26.5 billion, an increase of $270 million over 2006. Improved realizations increased earnings by almost $2.5 billion, reflecting a nearly $8 per barrel increase in average crude oil prices, partially offset by lower natural gas realizations. Other factors included the combined effect of higher expenses, including the impact of new project start-ups, increased exploration activity and negative tax effects.", "Full year oil equivalent production was down 1% versus 2006. Liquid volumes were down 2%, while natural gas volumes were up just under 1%. Excluding the Venezuela expropriation, divestments, quotas and price and spend impacts on volumes, production was up nearly 1%. New project volumes in West Africa, Russia, the North Sea and Qatar, more than offset natural fuel decline in mature areas and PSC net interest reductions of approximately 100,000 barrels per day. For further data on regional volumes, please refer the press release and IR supplement.", "Turning now to the Downstream results. Earnings in the fourth quarter were $2.3 billion, up nearly $310 million from the fourth quarter of 2006. Lower margins reduced earnings by $410 million primarily due to lower U.S. refining margins. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $290 million, reflecting the benefits of our ongoing refinery optimization activities. Other affects improved earnings by $430 million, driven by gains on assets sales this quarter. LIFO inventory effects were about in line with 2006. Sequentially, fourth quarter earnings increased by $265 million, lower margins reduced earnings by $660 million, driven by a weaker refining margins and marketing margins. Volume in mixed effects increased earnings by $310 million due to improved refining operations and lower turnaround activity.", "Other factors increased earnings by $620 million, including positive LIFO inventory effects of approximately $250 million and also higher asset sales. Full year 2007, downstream earnings were a record for the corporation at $9.6 billion, $1.1 billion higher than 2006. Lower margins reduced earnings by $230 million, reflecting lower refining margins in the U.S. Volume and mixed effects benefited earnings by $780 million, reflecting our ongoing focus on refinery feedstock flexibility, capacity utilization and product optimization. Other factors improved earnings by $570 million, including positive effects from asset sales.", "Focusing now on our Chemicals results. Fourth quarter Chemical earnings were $1.1 billion, $130 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2006. Margin effects reduced earnings by $520 million, as higher feedstock costs more than offset increased product realizations. Volume and mixed effects improved earnings by $170 million, reflecting higher commodity and specialty sales. Other factors were a positive $220 million, including favorable tax and foreign exchange effects.", "Sequentially, fourth quarter Chemical earnings decreased by $90 million. Lower margins reduced earnings by $300 million, as higher feedstock costs more than offset increased realizations. Other factors benefited earnings by $180 million, including positive tax and LIFO inventory effects. Full year 2007 Chemical earnings were a record, at $4.6 billion, up $180 million from 2006. Lower margins reduced earnings by $330 million, reflecting increased feedstock cost, partially offset by higher product realizations. Higher sales volumes and positive mixed effects increased earnings by $118 million. Other effects were a positive $330 million, including favorable foreign exchange effects.", "Now turning to our Corporate and Financing statement. The corporation recorded fourth quarter earnings of $77 million, down $341 million from fourth quarter 2006, primarily due to the absence of positive tax effects. For the full year 2007 Corporate and Financing segment expenses were $23 million compared to earnings of $24 million in 2006. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and full year 2007 was 44%.", "The corporation distributed almost $9 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter through dividends and share repurchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $7 billion was distributed to purchase shares in excess of dilution, reducing the number of shares outstanding by 1.5%. For the full year 2007, we purchased $28 billion of shares in shares in excess of dilution and reduced shares outstanding by 6%, further demonstrating our ongoing commitment to return cash to our shareholders.", "CapEx in the fourth quarter was $6.2 billion, an increase of 21% from fourth quarter 2006, and bringing 2007 full year CapEx to $20.9 billion. This is in line with our previous guidance and an increase of $1 billion from 2006. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations and asset sales was $13.1 billion. At the end of the fourth quarter, our cash balance was $34 billion and debt was 9.6.", "In summary, these record results again demonstrate how ExxonMobil's longstanding commitment to the integrity of our operations, disciplined investment and integrated business model continue to deliver superior results. Finally, I would like to mention two upcoming events, first in mid-February, we will be releasing our 2007 reserves performance data and second, as many of you will already have seen, our analysts meeting this year will take place on March 5th This will include a live audio webcast beginning at 9 AM Eastern, 8 AM Central Time and an update on a forward business plans. ExxonMobil's presenters will be led by Chairman and CEO, Rex Tillerson.", "That concludes my prepared remarks. I would now be happy to take your questions.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "Thank you sir. Today's question-and-answer session will be held electronically. [Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question from Doug Terreson at Morgan Stanley.", "Douglas T. Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Congratulations on record results Henry.", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "Thanks Doug.", "Douglas T. Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "The rate of inflation on production costs was fairly high last year for you guys and others in the industry too. And on this point, besides the successful capital and project management plans you guys have, I want to see if you provide an update on any productivity programs or initiatives that might be in place or emerging in E&P and also the result that you have to achieve if these plans are in place; meaning, in refinery for instance, you talked a little bit about molecule-management program that I think you guys expect to receive an earnings benefit of $250 million by 09 and so. The question is whether similar plans are in place in E&P and if so, any targets you might have?", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "Yes. When you look at how we approach OpEx and general cost inflation across our business, it's something that basically is an approach we take whether its upstream, downstream, chemicals we are always looking for improved efficiencies, technologies will help lower costs and basically self improvement kinds of or self help kinds of initiatives.", "If you look at the E&P area in particular, I mean past year is one of... if you look at one of the areas of the biggest ramp-up in cost has been in drill rigs and of course things you can do to reduce those costs, drilling faster, being able to make those, bringing those wells more productively is a big driver. We've spent over $4 billion a year in drilling alone. So it's... it can have a big drive on reducing on those costs.", "When you look at our developments in the Piceance's Basin, the multi-zone stimulation technology that we have there, again it's basically driven technology that helps us lower cost and improve productivity of those operations. And of course, then throughout our organization, we are constantly focused on reducing energy requirements and running operations efficiently throughout the business. So, I can share some specific targets, generally though, if you look at what we have delivered in self help kinds of things and OpEx, it's brought forward, if you look at the past, about $1 billion a year and we'll sharing with you the results of that in our upcoming analyst meetings.", "Douglas T. Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great. Henry thanks a lot.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Mark Flannery with Credit Suisse.", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Hi Henry.", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "Hi.", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "I'm looking for some guidance really on the PSC impact that we might want to factor in for 2008. There has been a big run up in oil prices, we are not asking you to forecast oil prices but, can you give us some rule of thumb maybe for what would happen to your expectations of 2008 production, let's say, if oil average $90 for 2008 versus averaging $70 for 2008?", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "Well we will be going through and actually updating our production profile at the analyst meeting in March. But just stepping back, I think it maybe helpful to talk about what's been going on in this area. What you see in the PSC impacts and these net interest reductions, basically it's a reflection of accelerated ... a significant acceleration in value that we have captured associated with these projects. The higher prices basically have improved the economics, but they do end up reducing the number of barrels. We have just over 20% of our production under PSC-type terms. Not all of those PSCs are the same, they can have different, both terms and characteristics, including the extent to which they changed... our volumes change over time. When you look at the effects that we have seen, most of those have occurred in Africa and then the PSC reductions and net interest reductions, basically reflect us moving through investment return thresholds at those specific developments.", "Now these occur at different times during the year, it depends on the price, it depends on the performance of the projects. So to go through and give you a rough estimate at this point is and especially when you are doing year-on-year comparisons and you look at where those trends changes change, we will go through and give you our best estimate of that at our March 5th meeting.", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot.", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "Yes.", "Operator", "We will go next to Nicky Decker, Bear Stearns.", "Nicole Decker - Bear Stearns", "Good morning Henry. My question is on Angola, really regarding the Angola development, now that OPEC quotas have been assigned there. Are you seeing any changes in terms of the pace at which projects are able to move forward there and may be you could comment on where you are on Kizomba D?", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "We are not really, in terms of the impact from OPEC or their joining OPEC, we really haven't seen anything roll through. As you see in the Kizomba C developments, they've moved ahead first schedule. And the Kizomba A satellites are moving ahead as we expect. So we can't point anything that would say there's change there associated with that. And we've had very good relations in the... as you know, those projects have performed very well both in terms of being able to bring them in on-schedule and at our costs and so, basically we are moving ahead and on-schedule for those deliveries.", "Nicole Decker - Bear Stearns", "Okay, and on that note Henry, did you say Saxi/Batuque starts later this year?", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "Yes.", "Nicole Decker - Bear Stearns", "Is that a little ahead of schedule?", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "No, that's about on-schedule.", "Nicole Decker - Bear Stearns", "Okay. Thank you.", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "Yes, no problem.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Hi Henry.", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "Hey Paul.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Henry, I was just wondering, are you expecting to replace the 100% of reserves this year?", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "Well, as you know and I mentioned, we'll give you that update in a couple of weeks here.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Is that the... is the couple of weeks kind of the timeframe to that --", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "Yes. Mid-February, we typically are coming out with that and we'll have it soon.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "As a follow-up to Mark Flannery's question, I was wondering about PSC impact. Is there any idea that you can give us on how that might eat away the number?", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "Well, we will give you the update and we were really talking about all of these kinds of effects at our analysts meeting. But, I mean that's just our usual time for these things and I am just not going to prejudge those things at this point.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Yes, that was actually a trick question Henry.", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "I know that.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Henry, could you just on the line item basis go through your asset sales, because it came up a number of times. I wondered if you could be so kind to just strip out upstream, downstream?", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "Speaking in the downstream?", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Upstream... international Upstream, U.S. Downstream, if possible thanks.", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "Yes, in the Upstream, there is... we have some asset sales, the largest of those was car and then if you look at the downstream --", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "I guess there isn't price on that, Henry?", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "No, no.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Thanks.", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "And then if you look at the Downstream as we mentioned it was about $450 million associated with the Downstream divestments. Those were made up of a number of different... none of them large in on their own, both mostly in Europe and in our marketing operations. But it's part of our normal process that we go through possibly looking at our portfolio, looking at what the market is willing to pay for things and we are constantly high-grading and basically reflects our ongoing activity.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "So you have nothing in Chemicals.", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "No.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "And no acquisitions?", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "Nothing on material, anyway.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "And no acquisitions?", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "No.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Finally from me Henry, Nigeria, there may be some issues we understand to do with renegotiation there. Can you update us and I will leave it there. Thank you.", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "Yes, thanks. There is... I mean there has been some things in the press in that kind of business. But right now, basically the affiliates operate in several joint venture concessions there in Nigeria. And under the Nigerian law, the production sharing contract is subject to review in 2008. We are not going to... I am not going to really speculate on the future business or discuss those future business perhaps that might come out, those discussions will go on during that timeframe, so we will see.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Thank you", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "Yes.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Kath Lucas at J P Morgan.", "Katherine Lucas - J P Morgan", "Hi, good morning, it's Kath Lucas for Michael LaMotte.", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "Hi.", "Katherine Lucas - J P Morgan", "Hi, I have quick question on Qatar. Seems like some contractors like Techniques are announcing some charges related to some overruns. Are these negotiated settlements that would translate into higher project completion costs for Exxon or are things moving along there as you had originally anticipated?", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "Things are moving ahead, basically per schedule and we've had no changes to our assessment there in terms of the costs associated with those. I mean if you look, there has been some things, people have... different folks have talked about, potential for delays. Right now our schedule is that... as per original schedule, we anticipate start-up of Qatar gas to Train 4 in 2008, also the RasGas Train 6 is scheduled for start-up in 2008. And then Qatar gas 2, Train 5 projected in 2009 and RasGas Train 7 in 2009. So no real change to what we have laid out in the past in the schedule or cost wise.", "Katherine Lucas - J P Morgan", "Okay great, thanks. And if I could just ask a final on Brazil, I think the original indications were that you just got the first export trial on BM-S-22 in the fourth quarter this year, but it seems like there maybe the potential to do, can you give us an update on the timing on the first well?", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "Well, we are working to progress that and basically we will be moving ahead with this... as we have the rig available to start that. We expect to do it in the second half of this year.", "Katherine Lucas - J P Morgan", "Okay, great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Next you Oswald Clint at Sanford C. Bernstein.", "Oswald Clint - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Hello, Hi, Good morning Henry.", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "Hi [indiscernible]", "Oswald Clint - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Just a couple of question, first on the line items. Is there ... could tell us if there is a Canadian tax benefit in the international Upstream and then secondly, perhaps just an update on Venezuela. We didn't get any color on that this quarter. And then finally, just if there anything you can say on the Julia discovery in terms of can we expect an appraisal well some time later in the current year. Thank you.", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "Yes, I mean in the tax area, if you look at the biggest tax impacts in the Upstream, the largest was associated with Alaska actually, and then there were...there was impacts in Canada, but relatively small. U.K. was the other one that had had some impact in the period. And then, Julia basically as we've had indications of hydrocarbon there. We were scheduled to start in the first quarter to help basically appraise the extent of the discovery. And was there another piece on Venezuela --", "Oswald Clint - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Yes.", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "It's basically, it's ongoing we have filed with the... for the arbitrations and we'd like get back to the table if we can get things under discussion with the Venezuelans on that. But basically we are proceeding on the arbitration track at this point.", "Oswald Clint - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Okay. Thank you.", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "Yes.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Next to Doug Leggate of Citigroup.", "Doug Leggate - Citigroup", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "Hi Doug.", "Doug Leggate - Citigroup", "Hi, I apologies Henry, I may have missed a little bit of what you've been saying already.", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "I understand.", "Doug Leggate - Citigroup", "My question was on the kind of non recurring of the ... I guess you can call them anymore but the one-off items.", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "Yes.", "Doug Leggate - Citigroup", "Just trying to get some absolute feel for the level on the split, particularly in the Downstream and if you could going in for a little bit more detail on the $600 million, I think in the Upstream also?", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "Yes, if... again if you look at the downstream and I am assuming you are talking fourth quarter 07 fourth quarter 06.", "Doug Leggate - Citigroup", "Yes, If we could get the absolute number, Henry that would be great.", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "Well they were about... as we mentioned in the call or in the script they were about $450 million associated with asset sales in the period. And if you look at those were basically the biggest piece of those were in Europe and our marketing operations, just part of our ongoing, hi-grading we did talk about that just before. So none of them were by themselves very significant. And then if you look at in the Upstream the $600 million negative basically, it's a number of items as they typically are in these areas, number of them tax related, Alaska was one of the bigger pieces but we also had impacts as I mentioned in the UK, that will also increase the expenses, some of that associated with the new project start-ups. Those were kind of the big negatives in there.", "Doug Leggate - Citigroup", "Okay and if I may just go back to the 450 in India, there it is $450 million higher. So was it actually $450 million absolute as well.", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "That was basically... there wasn't much of anything else in the prior period. Right?", "Doug Leggate - Citigroup", "That's sound, that's fine. Thanks very much.", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "Yes, no problem.", "Operator", "It appears that we are standing by with no further questions at this time. Mr. Hubble, I would like to turn the conference back to you for any closing or additional comments.", "Henry H Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary", "Well I would just like to thank everybody for their time and questions this morning.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Henry Hubble. Please go ahead, sir.", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Exxon Mobil's teleconference and webcast on our first quarter 2008 financial and operating results. As you are aware from this morning's press release, Exxon Mobil continues to deliver strong earnings performance. In an environment of high commodity prices, Exxon Mobil's outstanding portfolio of integrated businesses performed well allowing us to deliver record first-quarter results.", "Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement. Please note that estimates, plans and expectations are forward-looking statements. Actual results including resource recoveries, volume growth and project outcomes could differ materially due to factors I discuss and factors noted in our SEC filings. Please see factors affecting future results and the form 8-K we furnished this morning, which are available through the investor section of our website. Please also see the frequently used terms, the supplements to this morning's press release. And the 2007 financial and operating review on our website. This material defines key terms I will use today; shows Exxon Mobil's net interest in specific projects and includes our SEC regulations G disclosure.", "Now I'm pleased to turn your attention to our first quarter results. Exxon Mobil's first quarter 2008 normalized earnings and net income were $10.9 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion from the first quarter of 2007. Earnings per share were $2.03, up 25% from a year ago. Driven by the strong earnings and also the continuing benefits of our share repurchase program. In the first quarter of 2008, we increased our quarterly share repurchases to reduce shares outstanding from $7 billion to $8 billion, demonstrating our commitment to return cash to our shareholders.", "Before I discuss specific business line results, I would like to share some of the milestones we achieved since the last earnings call. During the first quarter start-up was achieved at the Bulba field [ph] located at 120 miles off the coast of Norway in the southern section of the Norwegian Continental Shelf. At its peak, this development is expected to produce 50,000 barrels of oil and 30 million cubic feet of natural gas per day.", "Further demonstrating the quality of our North Sea portfolio, in the first quarter we also announced the start-up of production from the Starling field in the U.K. sector of the North Sea. At peak production, the field is expected to deliver 110 million cubic feet of natural gas per day to the U.K. market. Following the January start-up of the Exxon Mobil operated Mondo field in the field in the Kizomba C development offshore Angola, Starling are the second and third major upstream start-ups for Exxon Mobil this year.", "In total, we anticipate 12 major upstream project start-ups in 2008, including the first two 7.8 million ton per annum LNG trains in Qatar, in the second half of the year. Also in the first quarter, Exxon Mobil signed the main principles agreement for a new 25-year production-sharing contract with the Malaysian National Oil Company, Petronas. Through the new PSC, we expect to invest in significant enhanced oil recovery and conventional oil development activities in Malaysia, utilizing our proprietary technologies and industry leading project execution capabilities.", "Exxon Mobil's advantage technologies continue to deliver competitive differentiation and maximize the profitability of our upstream producing assets. In the first quarter, we broke our own world record for extended reach drilling total depth, with the completion of the Z-12 well at our Sakhalin I project in Russia. The well was drilled from land and reached its target depth more than seven miles offshore. Through the implementation of Exxon Mobil leading edge technologies, we've improved drilling performance at Sakhalin by over 50% since the project began.", "Also, in the first quarter we added to our global portfolio of outstanding deepwater exploration opportunities. In the recent Gulf of Mexico lease sale, we were the high bidder for 15 blocks totaling 85,000 acres. Additionally, we were awarded 13 full and partial blocks totaling 760,000 gross acres in the Porcupine basin, offshore Ireland. Exxon Mobil continues to make significant progress in the capture of high potential, unconventional exploration opportunities around the globe.", "In April, we announced two new agreements related to unconventional gas and liquids opportunities in Hungary. The first is a joint exploration program covering a 387,000 gross acres in the Mako Trough area of southeast Hungary. The second is a production and development agreement covering a further 185,000 gross acres on an adjacent block. Our work programs in Hungary including wells, production tests and reservoir evaluation studies are getting underway this year. Exxon Mobil, along with majority owned affiliate, Imperial Oil Limited, further enhanced our portfolio of unconventional exploration opportunities, with the recently announced capture of about 115,000 acres in the Horn River Basin in the Northeastern British Columbia, Canada.", "Plans to evaluate the shale gas play potential, includes seismic acquisition and exploration drilling in late 2000 and beyond. Exxon Mobil brings industry leading technical expertise to all of these opportunities, including our fast drill process and our tight gas development capability. Exxon Mobil continues to pursue and capture a wide variety of opportunities to develop hydrocarbon resources to help meet growing energy demand.", "Now, moving to the downstream. In refining, we continue to improve our... the profitability of our operations through crude diversification. In the first quarter, we ran 35 crude new to individual refineries, nine of which were new to Exxon Mobil. We also continue to identify and implement projects to improve performance at our refineries by applying new technologies, which further enhance operations reliability, and margin capture.", "In our Lubricants and Specialties business, we launched the Mobil 1, advanced fuel economy synthetic motor oils in the U.S. In addition to providing outstanding engine protection, these advanced products can improve fuel efficiency in modern gasoline engines by up to 2% compared to traditional engine oils.", "In our Chemical Segment, Exxon Mobil launched a new methyllysine polyethylene platform called Enable mPE in the first quarter. This new product generates films with exceptional performance and also delivers energy savings in the production process. Our commitment to technology leadership and innovation continues to deliver breakthrough chemical products to meet the needs of our customers.", "During the quarter, Exxon Mobil's polyolefin plant in Baton Rouge was awarded the distinguished safety award from the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association for an unprecedented sixth consecutive year. This honor is a reflection of our fundamental and ongoing commitment to safety in all aspects of our operations.", "Now turning to the business line results. Upstream earnings in the first quarter were a record at $8.8 billion up $2.7 billion from the first quarter of 2007. We continue to capture the benefit of strong industry conditions this quarter with upstream after-tax unit earnings of just over $23 per barrel. Record crude oil and natural gas realizations increased earnings by $4.4 billion. Worldwide crude oil realizations were up $38.50 per barrel, and natural gas realizations were up $2.43 per Kcf from the first quarter of 2007.", "Volume and mix effects reduced earnings, as increased natural gas volumes were more than offset by lower crude oil volumes. Other effects reduced earnings by $900 million. Just over a third of that reduction was due to higher taxes; about 250 million reflects the impact of increased operating expenses including the effect of new field start-ups and increased exploration activity. And the balance was primarily lower earnings from asset sales.", "As anticipated in our outlook for 2008, volumes were lower in the first quarter than a year ago. Oil equivalent volumes decreased about 5.5% from the first quarter of last year. Excluding the Venezuela expropriation, divestments, coders and pricing spend impacts volumes were down 3%. The decrease was primarily due to PSC net interest reductions of approximately 80,000 barrels per day and the impact of maintenance activities in West Africa.", "Major project ramp ups in the North Sea and West Africa and increased European natural gas demand, offset fuel decline in mature areas. Our 2008, volume profile which we shared at our recent march Analyst Meeting, is back-end loaded due to the timing of major field start-ups, including the two large LNG trains in Qatar, [inaudible] SGP build facilities in Kazakhstan, and Thunder Horse in the Gulf of Mexico in the third and fourth quarters of this year.", "Liquid's production decreased about 270,000 barrels per day or 10% from the first quarter of last year. Excluding the Venezuela expropriation, divestments, quotas and price and spend impacts on volumes, production was down 6%. Major project ramp ups in West Africa and the North Sea were more than offset by natural fuel decline in matured areas, PSC net interest reductions and the impact of maintenance activities in West Africa. Gas volumes increased approximately 130 million cubic feet per day from the first quarter of 2007. New product volumes and higher demand due to colder weather in Europe were partly offset by natural fuel decline in mature areas.", "Turning now to the sequential comparison. Versus the fourth quarter of 2007. upstream earnings increased $580 million due to higher crude oil and natural gas realizations, partly offset by lower volumes and other effects primarily lower earnings from asset sales. Liquid's production decreased 2% due to the maintenance activities in West Africa and also price and spend impact. Natural gas production was also lower primarily due to natural fuel decline in mature areas. Oil equivalent volumes were down 2% from the fourth quarter. For further data on regional volumes, please refer to the press release and IR supplement.", "Turning now to the downstream results. Earnings in the first quarter were $1.2 billion, down nearly $750 million from the first quarter of 2007. Refining margins were markedly lower, compressed by rising crude prices, which reduced earnings by $1 billion. Volume and mix affects increased earnings by $350 million primarily due to refinery optimization activities. Other effects reduced earnings by $90 million, reflecting higher operating expenses including increased U.S. turnaround activity, partly offset by positive foreign exchange effects.", "Sequentially, first quarter earnings were $1.1 billion, below fourth quarter 2007. Lower margins reduced earnings by $360 million, while volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $80 million, primarily due to increased turnaround activity in the U.S. Other factors reduced earnings by $660 million, including the absence of positive LIFO inventory effects of about $250 million and approximately $400 million in lower earnings associated from asset sales.", "Focusing now on our chemical earnings. First quarter chemical earnings of $1 billion were $210 million lower than the first quarter of 2007. Lower margins reduced earnings by $350 million, as higher feedstock costs, more than offset increased product realizations. Other impacts increased earnings by $140 million, reflecting favorable foreign exchange and tax effects. Sequentially, first quarter chemical earnings decreased by $85 million. Higher margins increased earnings by $40 million as increased realizations more than offset higher feedstock cost. Lower volumes reduced earnings by $30 million, while other factors including the absence of positive tax and LIFO effects reduced earnings by $90 million.", "Turning now to our corporate and financing segment. Corporate and financing expenses in the first quarter were $90 million, versus earnings of $90 million in the same period a year ago, including the impact of higher corporate costs and the absence of positive tax effects. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 49%. Our cash balance was $41 billion and debt was $10 billion at the end of the first quarter.", "The corporation distributed a total of nearly $10 billion to shareholders in the first quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding, an increase of $1.1 billion or 13% versus the first quarter of 2007. During the first quarter, Exxon Mobil made share purchases in excess of dilution of $8 billion, reducing the number of shares outstanding by 1.8% and further demonstrating our ongoing commitment to return cash to our shareholders.", "Yesterday, our Board announced an increase in the quarterly dividend, of just over 14% to $0.40 per share. Exxon Mobil has paid a dividend each year for more than a century. And has increased its annual dividend payment for 26 consecutive years. CapEx in the first quarter was $5.5 billion, up almost $1.3 billion or 30% from the first quarter of 2007, and consistent with our outlook for 2008.", "In summary, this quarter's results again highlight the quality of our integrated business model and disciplined investment approach allowing us to leverage, robust industry conditions and deliver superior results for our shareholders. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'd now be happy to take your questions.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "Thank you Mr. Hubble. The question and answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions]. And we'll go first to Doug Terreson with Morgan Stanley.", "Douglas Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Good morning Henry.", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Hi Doug.", "Douglas Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "In U.S. refining and marketing, specifically Shell, my question in regard whether the economic effect of the switch, away from Venezuelan and feedstock was significant in the period and if so any quantification on that factor would be appreciated?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "It was not a major factor in the results. The primary issue associated with the margins that you saw really they're kind of across the Board, if you look around the globe.", "Douglas Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Sure.", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "When you look at the composite worldwide margin, it was down about 245 a barrel and it was really kind of shared throughout the system. And so, I wouldn't point to anything specific at Shell [ph].", "Douglas Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "And also, did you say that the $660 million of other item that unfavorably affected the down stream was related to LIFO mix effects and if I missed that, what was that negative delta related to?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Yes. We had about $250 million of LIFO effect in the fourth quarter, you may recall, and then there was also lower gains from asset sales. We had a number of asset sales that were in that period and it was the absence of about 400... a little $400 million worth of asset sales that were not in the period. So, what you're seeing here is pretty clean in terms of overall other impacts.", "Douglas Terreson - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Okay, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Mark Flannery with Credit Suisse.", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Hi, I've got a couple of questions, one is can you tell us what's happening with units production costs and unit DD&A in international E&P. Are we still seeing both of those numbers rise, and would you expect maybe to see them bend down a little bit in the second half of the year, as you get some of that in your production on? Then, I've a second one.", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Well, if you look kind of, you are going to have impacts, non-cash impacts associated with new projects that we're bringing on, and you are seeing those continuing impacts as we are basically spending\u2026 the CapEx spending to bring on those new projects. But, I guess, if I step back from in terms of, inflationary effects, we have a consistent program of working to offset those things and if you look at... when we look kind of across the Board around the globe, we're pretty well able to offset the normal inflation effects, now there is some areas of our business, where we are seeing higher rates of inflation that we're not able to fully offset, but we've been able to get two-thirds of that essentially in the past.", "And we're just not immune to those cost impacts, but I think from the upstream perspective, the real focus I would point to is, if you look at the net income per barrel, you will find that the capture rate of earnings that we have on our per barrel basis, continues to be quite strong, and that's a reflection of being able to manage all of these impacts overall in a positive way.", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Okay, thanks. Can I just switch my second one over to European refinery run rate, which at least against old model, a little bit light in the first quarter, how would you characterize your maintenance activities there?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Well, in the throughput area, if you look at, the biggest impact in Europe was the Englestock refinery sale, that we had in the period that took out over 90 a day of capacity. So, that was the big and we did have a turnaround that fall in the period as well. But, if you're looking at general, we did see some\u2026 we did see some lower demand and as well but that was... those were the big impact in the period.", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Right. And just around that question, on US refining, are you faring any downstream capacity right now, particularly think about SGCS or other gasoline units?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "No we are... all of our conversion capacity is running full, has been running full, and we did have some turnaround activity in parallel basically doing essential maintenance that we have to do and we tend to be a little in the outside of the gasoline season, we tend to take more of those turnarounds. So we end up about, if you look around the globe about 30% of our turnarounds in the first quarter. But in the US in particular, basically we are running conversion capacity full out.", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Great.", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "And overall when you look at the market supply, because as you know the gasoline inventories are... have been quite high, we have been really aiming to maximize distillate production in the period as well.", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Neil McMahon at Bernstein.", "Neil McMahon - Bernstein", "Hi, Henry.", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Hi Neil?", "Neil McMahon - Bernstein", "Just a few questions. The first is really on your increase in exploration expense, I think this must be going to the Tayrona block in Colombia and it looks like that a dry well was drilled there, and that was done using your R3M electromagnetic technology and it is sort of follows, I think a separate news reports correctly sort of disappointing results from Northern basin last year as well. Am I right in thinking this because that sort of raise questions about some of that technology?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Well, what you see in the numbers, the increased cost is really\u2026 have been associated with seismic activity. When you look at the number of places that we have acquired acreage positions and we are now out basically shooting seismic to evaluate those in both Libya and New Zealand and others. Now when you get back to the comment on the R3M technology, we are utilizing that broadly. It is not a silver bullet though, I mean it's a technology that helps reduce risk, it helps improve our valuation of these, but it doesn't give you 100% indication.", "So the way we utilize it helps to de-risk these plays, but whenever you are dealing with a wildcat exploration well, you are going to have still have, even with R3M significant risk associated with those. But obviously these are prospects that we think have potential and we are evaluating the data from both the open wells and Tayrona wells that we drilled and looking at next steps.", "Neil McMahon - Bernstein", "But you are still planning Madagascar and Southern Basin off shore in New Zealand and little sort of exploration well, there is still a part of the whole well count risk awarded program?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Yes, I mean yes. I mean all of those things, and we continue to utilize the R3M as part of our data collection efforts in these new areas, because we do think it's delivering value in our ability to assess the prospects.", "Neil McMahon - Bernstein", "Okay. Second question was really on, as you mentioned the production sharing agreements, in West Africa, what's\u2026 certainly it looks like Kizomba A and B went form cost oil to profit oil last year. What, was there anything and addition for that may be on your interest in block 17, that did that in this quarter, that brought volumes down or was there just a general West African effect, that\u2019s all from me.", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Well, you have a combination, I mean when you have, when you do on a year-on-year comparison, I mean the tranche effects that we saw during last year, you're still seeing those in the year-on-year comparison, you're going to continue to see those year-on-year comparisons. Now, there are multiple tranches, different projects came on at different points, so you are different places and different ones, but the other PSC effect that we talked a about a little bit was continue to have pricing spend impacts associated with them and that's basically variable reflecting the current price of crude, and the relative spend that is going on in the given period. So, we see both of those effects, but, all of that when you come back and look at it on the grand scheme of things, we've been gathering significant early value, these projects, they're performing very well and both from the original project development but also in their continuing operations. But, we are getting into some lower tranches in the number of these deals.", "Neil McMahon - Bernstein", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Yes.", "Operator", "And to next to Michael LaMotte at JP Morgan.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "Hi Henry.", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Hi.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "Pretty quickly on the Hungary, maybe if I can ask you to do a little bit of comparing contrast, particularly given a news flow around Hansfield [ph], Marcellus and some of the shale plays and unconventional plays in lower 48, that's in Horn River Basin in Canada, obviously but, I'm wondering if you're taking a look at those lower 48 plays at all, and see something in Hungry, that's truly unique, can you give provide a little bit more color on that? Maybe in contrast with some relative opportunities here?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Yes. Well, I'm not, I can't give you a relative comparison, what I can tell you is we are\u2026 we got a pretty wide approach on what we're looking at. We look at a lot of prospects and we have a global program that allows us to look and sets opportunities around the globe. And what we try to do is identify the best resources of type wherever they are and having that global capability is one of the advantages that we have. And these are some of the areas that we think have potential but it is still early days. We're going to be going through evaluation of the Hungary, Horn River and others.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "When you come down to, why do we see advantage in some of these areas, we bring some technology frankly that makes that we think... provides us with some unique advantages in this kinds of developments with the multi zone stimulation technology that we have with the fast drill technologies that we have. All of those are really important in these kinds of developments. We're going to be drilling a lot of wells in there in tight gas kind of place.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "Is it geology or end market or both that sort of pushes you into an area like Hungary?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "All of the above.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "And is there anything in particular in the resource that you can talk about today that would lead you to build such a big position, almost 600,000 acres.", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "As I say, we basically being able to take advantage of our global understanding of these potential basins and to get in there early and work with the folks and being able to evaluate these prospects. Again we are going through an evaluation phase, we are going to be doing seismic and other delineation activities to understand what we have there.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Maybe to assume back on global sales quickly, just in terms of seismic activity. How do you see that unfolding over the next few quarters? Or you still sort of in expansion mode there, or is it a steady state, or is it going to be winding down over the next few quarters?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "We have been watching our acreage pickup. We have a number of areas that we are going to be taking a look at. So I'd say, I can't give you a direct figure but directionally up.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. That is helpful. And then lastly, thoughts on the Alaska pipeline?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Yes. Well as... we continue to look for ways to move that forward, have been evaluating the various proposals and discussions around those various proposals. And basically looking for the most effective way to\u2026 the one, get the maximum value for the State of Alaska or ourselves, production and to move that ahead. But, what we're trying do is, basically evaluate the various options that are there are now and what our next steps are to be?", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. How should be think about the current proposal with the DP and Conoco going forward?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "We're in the, from our own prospective, I think probably I want to talk to those guys about that in particular. But from our own prospective, we're evaluating that. We've been asked to participate, and we're looking at it.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And next over to Arjun Murti of Goldman Sachs.", "Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you Henry. A follow-up to some of the comments on the West African oil production, you mentioned maintenance activity hurt volumes in the first quarter?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Yes.", "Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs", "Would it be possible to quantify the rough magnitude of that?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Yes. I mean it was in\u2026 about 40 a day of impact there.", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "40 a day. Got you. So, then that sort of get this stock towards the 3Q and 4Q production was and the profit shared?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Yes. When you look at the PSC net interest changes, and the price spend impacts because we did see even higher prices in this period. You've got about in total the combination of those in West Africa is about 120.", "Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs", "The combination of maintenance and PSC effects?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "No, actually the combination of PSC net interest changes and price spend impacts.", "Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs", "I'm sorry, price spends impact. Got you, that's 120?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Yes, correct. And then maintenance was on top of that.", "Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs", "Yes, that then starts making more sense, I guess we've thought South Africa overall is a growing region, So your net volumes can be what they are, but the gross volumes we thought are probably increasing, it sounds like that would get us closer.", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Well, when you're looking at gross production in the area, yes it is a growing area.", "Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs", "Absolutely. Henry any update on the timing of some of the Qatar LNG products that are scheduled to start up this year, are they still slated for second half of this year?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Yes, As I mentioned, are both of them we expect to have on this year. One we basically looking at the [inaudible] in 2008 and then [inaudible] in 2008. But, they will be back-end loaded as we mentioned.", "Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs", "Back-end loaded and then presumably some ramp up period as well?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Yes. Well, they've come on pretty fast, but\u2026 once they start-up, but basically you're going to see part year effects from the start-ups.", "Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs", "That's great. And then just a final one on the Alaskan gas. Some of the controversy that's right word over Point Thomson field, your participation or not in the Alaska pipeline, potentially tied to what ultimately happens to Point Thomson resource?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Well, Point Thomson is going to be, as important to the Alaska pipeline, it's hard to make sense out of that pipeline without Point Thomson being developed, so there, you need both. And our view on Point Thomson, I mean, we were frankly surprised and disappointed by the Department of Natural Resources decisions there, and we will be pursuing our rights in that area and we're appealing or asking for rehearing on that, but we laid out commitments there to bring that production on, and develop that production. So, frankly we were surprised to see how that turned down at this point and we'll be pursuing for rehearing and our rights to further in that regard.", "Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs", "Got you. That's great, thank you very much Henry.", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "No problem.", "Operator", "And next to Paul Sankey at Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Hi, good morning Henry.", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Good morning.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Henry, if you don't want to, just like to keep reaching around in the volumes a bit here. Firstly, just to go through the lines, on the U.S, I'm assuming that its just all natural fuel decline, the 10% overall decline, you got there is related to that, or whether some issues with maintenance and down time there?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "The big chunk of that is, decline, it's a mature area and the bulk of what you have is decline. When we talk about our global decline rates, we've been talking about high 5% to 6% in that level. So, this is mature area and its\u2026 that's what you're seeing there.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Great. Thanks and then, kind of the South America, I know there was some issues in Canada. Could you strip out what was Canada, what was Venezuela for us?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Venezuela is essentially all of it that you're looking out there. When you get down into the gas, the big change there, I mean that's basically was a bulk of that was blow down, we had that at the\u2026 it's the absence of having blow down versus last year.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And you've gone through Africa in some detail. The one question of course is Nigeria. Now is reportedly had a 800,000 barrel a day outage, and its right? Could you comment on that for the quarter, this quarter?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Yes. Well, what you heard, you know we had, on April 24th, the local chapter of the Senior Oil Workers Union there in Nigeria, halted collective bargaining discussions that we had and withdrew their services there. The union subsequently shut in those facilities. What we have heard this morning is that the union has directed the employees to return to facilities and so we are anticipating that will to move things ahead there.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "So this should be about 10 day, I guess outage for the quarter?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "That implies a start-up or ramp up and I really can't, I don't know what that is going to be. So more to come on that, there are still some discussions going on. I mean they have agreed basically direct the people back to work but we still have some discussions going on there.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "And the last one on this kind of granularity on the volumes, Europe obviously we can see the jump with the gas season, but I was wondering on the oil, if there is anything you could strip out there between the various effects on the decline?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "No. I mean there is some downtime in there but the big piece of that again is, it's a mature area and mostly decline.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Got you Sales, Henry of product over the world wide down 5% US down 8%, Asia Pacific down 6%, could you just walk us through, I'm assuming that is not the market collapsing, if you could just walk us through the effects there, that would be great on petroleum product sales?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Yes. I mean if you look at by region the impacts... I mean it is actually US markets... essentially what we are seeing is in the mature markets we are seeing some softening of demand. But if we look at global growth overall, we are still seeing on a overall net basis, petroleum product growth, lower rates of growth versus our 10 year average, but still growth. Most of that occurring in the developing parts of the world and in the price controlled areas. Now the... our specific results, the bulk of our reductions are actually associated with the portfolio of high grading and the divestment activities about 60% of that is associated with that. The balance is due to a number of factors including as we talked lower refinery throughput but also demand softening of the demand and those are really the major impacts in the decrease in overall product sales.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Great. I appreciate that. And then the final one on this line and I have got one very brief follow up, is just chemicals, it's notable that your US volumes are, the sales volumes are sharply down.", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "There is some of that is... there was a piece of that that we are\u2026 mostly in commodities, and you saw that both in the US and Europe but some of that is basically associated with turnarounds as well. In the chemicals business we talk about many cycles within the business and frequently when you see rapidly rising crude prices and feed stock costs, there will be pre-buying and then people holding off, so you will see some swings in volumes associated with that basically trying to manage the price impacts.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, so we should go back to expecting more like 2.7 million tons in the US, and what's the potential for growth?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Well, I mean, we will see how it develops but I mean, I don't have any better basis to tell you at this point and the quality of the business obviously is very good. And that's a growing business and we continue to see it growing couple of GDP above... a couple of percent above worldwide GDP growth, so it's a growing. But most of that again has been Asia-Pac area. So that's where we are making the investments.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Yes. And then the very last... final one from me briefly is the tax rate of 49%, can you just talk more about whether or not that a sustainable, the ongoing level?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Well. I mean, when you look at the tax rates increase there, essentially part of that, the biggest piece of it as you look year-on-year is associated with it's... essentially mix of earnings. You have more upstream earnings, less in the downstream areas and also the mix around the globe as to where we are getting those earnings. So that was a big piece of that. And then we did have some lower one-time tax items that was, that was also in there. So those are the... those were the two big things and it's going to be very dependent on that mix of earnings for the future. So it's hard to predict, we've seen them moving around here a bit more likely because of the volatility in prices. So it's hard to predict exactly how that's going to be going forward.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks Henry, I leave it there. Thank you.", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "All right. Very good", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Doug Leggate at Citigroup.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Citigroup", "Thanks. Hi, Henry.", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Hi Doug.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Citigroup", "Couple of things. I guess also some housekeeping questions. The cash flow, operating cash flow is very high this quarter.", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Yes.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Citigroup", "Can you... is that just timing of tax payments or can you help understand a little bit what's going on there?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "You've got a piece of it. The timing of tax payments we typically see that in the first quarter where both Norway and US we have more tax expense and we have actual payments in the period. And then the other, but the bigger factor actually was associated with crude payables. And as you saw the rapid ran up in or the higher crude prices, we have basically close through into the higher crude payables, and that was the bigger impact. Of course we also had some net income increased that also impacted that as well. But the biggest factors were in the working capital changes.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Citigroup", "Can you give a total working capital move in the quarter?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Well, I mean if you come back to... it will come out in the Q, but there is the bulk of that is basically associated with the crude payables, and if you look at that delta, it's the biggest piece of the unexplained portion as the DD&A is about the same.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Citigroup", "Second one is to jump back to Paul's question about the tax rate, just to get a... may be a little bit of a breakdown, can you possibly give us what we quantify rather what was one-time tax items were, so we can get the underlying tax rate for the quarter?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "It was a smaller piece of the delta, if you look at it; it's about 20 about a third of the delta that you saw between the period.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Citigroup", "Will it be reasonable, let\u2019s assume we were in a similar environment over the balance of this year we'd expect that kind of rate going forward.", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Well. As I said, it's going depend very must on how the margins and the mix of earnings play out. It get identical may be it never has been identical.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Citigroup", "All right. Thanks Henry.", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "All right, very good.", "Operator", "We will go next to Paul Cheng at Lehman Brothers.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Hi Henry, how are you doing?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Hi Paul, very good.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Number of quick ones, just want to clarify. I think you were talking about the lack of foreign exchange gain on inventory in the number of your comment. So could we assume that this is a thin quarter that really no major, on the absolute term, no major foreign exchange or loess or inventory gain or loss and [inaudible]?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "That's correct. The inventory impacts as you see in our results generally and you seen in the fourth quarter associated with LIFO.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Right. So that, this quarter if we on the project forward that is a pretty clean quarter to use?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "That's correct. It did have some FOREX impact in the small though overall.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "And what is the magnitude on... you said some FOREX impact, you said 50 million or 100, 200?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "No, less than $100 million.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Less than a hundred?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "For total, yes.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, in Alaska after the acquisition [ph], the higher tax rate or the\u2026 whatever you call production tax I guess. Can you quantify what's that in the first quarter with the higher oil price that what's that incremental hit on you guys?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "I don't really have a delta quarter-on-quarter on that.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "May be, I try another one. Henry, when I looked at the European gas sales volume, certainly that you have a nice pickup typically they always do in the first quarter, that's for quite some time I think the message is that, you have substantially more excess capacity as a function of the demand, if the demand is there you can sell far more gas. So, I thought that the gas volume given how robust the market there will be even higher. So, is that now that the sort of like we've been on a swing by the production capacity in Europe, that and most you can do is about 5.1, 5.2 to be unless that you'll bring on new gas?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "No. I mean we have... we're basically meeting demand there and as you know [inaudible] operations, service a bit of the swing, our European swing and it was not tapped out. And it basically, its reflecting the cooler weather, that's what and you're meeting demand there.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "No. I mean the weather is pretty cold over there, so I thought that would be higher demand in that. So, you're saying that you actually spilled even in the first quarter, have excess capacity and production capacity than if you, if there is a demand that you can actually increase that?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Yes, that's correct.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. What is your capacity over there now, any rough idea?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "I don't have that off the top here.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. A final question over the last 18 months, I think lot of your smaller kind of pause has been pretty optimistic above some of the non-conventional pay in U.S. and obviously Exxon is very optimistic about and beyond. But, we haven't heard much about Bakken or the Barnett Shale or the other one. Wondering that how Exxon looking at in the lower 48 non-conventional play outside Pean [ph] is that those is too small economic enough that for you guys to be interest or that is an area that you guys may be interested also?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Yes. We're doing, we're constantly evaluating and we basically are looking for what we do is, we look for the best opportunities on a global basis and as I mentioned earlier that's one of the benefits we have with that global approach and we're targeting what we feel are the best opportunities with that we see out there.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "So, in another words, that seems you guys have not made any significant attempt into the other non conventional, is that in your global portfolio, those that just not going high up.", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Well, I mean we don't talk about everything we are looking at. So maybe more to come, who knows.", "Paul Cheng - Lehman Brothers", "Very good. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Robert Kessler with Simmons & Company.", "Robert Kessler- Simmons & Company", "I have some fairly quick, but granular questions on production. One, do you have a stat for what Mondo would have produced on average in the quarter of what it's producing today. And then secondly on Piceance, where are you at in terms of total production there now?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Piceance is still above 55 million cubic feet per day.", "Robert Kessler- Simmons & Company", "Is that what you are running, say a year ago, isn't it?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Yes. I mean, basically the expansion has not come on at this point. We are working on that direction but that has not come on. So that's... and Mondo it is about 100?", "Robert Kessler- Simmons & Company", "About 100 on average for the quarter or today?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "That's down a day.", "Robert Kessler- Simmons & Company", "100 a day, great. And just in terms of the follow-up on the Piceance, I mean I would have thought this is just a fairly well intensive development, and I'd have expected a bit more ratable production growth there? Is it going to be more lumpy or what should we really\u2026", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "It requires gas processing and that's... some of those facilities, basically the facilities are full, just waiting for those increments of gas processing.", "Robert Kessler- Simmons & Company", "Okay.

Is it mandated that in Canada to the extent Exxon Mobil does anything, it has to be along with Imperial's participation?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "No.", "Mark Gilman \u2013 Benchmark", "It is not?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "No.", "Mark Gilman \u2013 Benchmark", "Okay.", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "We work with them obviously very closely.", "Mark Gilman \u2013 Benchmark", "I mean, I guess I just kind of wonder if.... similar kind of structure is... and why it is, all things considered that you wouldn't do it on 100% basis as oppose to necessarily involving Imperial at all?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Well I mean, we basically enter into these arrangements with what we think who is going to deliver the most overall value to our shareholders and the structure is aligned with that.", "Mark Gilman \u2013 Benchmark", "Secondly, you made reference in your opening comments to the new Malaysian PSC. You have been the industry's leading producer in that country for a number of years operating under an existing PSC. I'm wondering does this new PSC essentially extend the existing one and/or the terms more on risk?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Well. It's basically an extension of the existing arrangements that we have there, but it does anticipate more enhanced oil recovery. And it's basically a PSC... extension of that PSC arrangement.", "Mark Gilman \u2013 Benchmark", "But the physical terms the same?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "We don't get into the specifics on that.", "Mark Gilman \u2013 Benchmark", "Okay. Final one, in your discussion of the E&P variances, you referred to tax factors in the other category and I'm wondering whether that was rate oriented or nearly total dollar oriented that was at the root of your comment?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "It's a mix of different things; I really wouldn't point to one in particular. It's a bit of both as to what you have there, but they are onetime effects.", "Mark Gilman \u2013 Benchmark", "They are one time?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Yes. Most of them.", "Mark Gilman \u2013 Benchmark", "So therefore it's not a rate item?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Well, I mean it's rate in a period.", "Mark Gilman \u2013 Benchmark", "Well, yes, but not a statutory rate change or something...", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "That's right, that's right.", "Mark Gilman \u2013 Benchmark", "Okay. Just one final volume question on Asia-Pacific, Middle Eastern gas volumes, sort of little bit lower than what I would thought they would be, is that a PSC effect at all? I mean Alkelege [ph] has that kind of structure I believe?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "I mean basically the decrease is largely lower demand in Qatar and then you also some in Australia as well. So you've seen a combined effect. We did have some plant maintenance in Qatar and that's really was the big impact.", "Mark Gilman \u2013 Benchmark", "Okay. Thanks a lot, Henry.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Eric Milky [ph] at Merrill Lynch.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, good morning, Henry.", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Hi, Eric.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Couple of quick ones from me. Just want to make sure I understand the maintenance impact in West Africa in the first quarter correctly. Could you quantify the sequential impact and if we should expect those volumes to be back on in the second quarter?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Yes. Sequentially it is about 30 in that range.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And then they should be back on for Q2?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "I'm looking to what I have on schedule. I think, that's good to some.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And on the production sharing contract impact on production, is there a seasonal; impact, is there a quarterly impact that you've more cost recovery at the beginning of the year, and therefore you have great entitlement in the earlier quarters. What do you accrue for that, so just be doing the entitlement process?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "It's not accrual. Basically, as spending occurs, it's reimbursed.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And on TMS 22 [ph] in Brazil, are you able to give us an update on where you have the rig?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Well, we had scheduled basically looking to do that in the third quarter of this year, and as you know, we're bringing in sea drill rigs to do that work, and we have no change for that plan, and basically we've done in the second half.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Then you see rig effect, when do you expect delivery of that?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Yes, I mean basically in the summer, but I don't know the exact date on it.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And for Sakhalin 1 production in Russia, and peak was 250. You are kind of running at about 225. Do you expect to maintain 225?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Yes. It is going to be in that range with may be some decline, but that's pretty close.", "Unidentified Analyst", "But not the 10% type decline that we saw year-on-year?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "No, I really don't have a field specific data that I can throw out there for you. But...", "Unidentified Analyst", "All right. And since the Investor Day that you had back in March, it's been some Ko [ph] project, can you tell what how that if that influences your timing of Ko, in terms of the water permit?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "As you know, we were disappointed with water permit issue. We're basically proceeding with the work that can go on outside of that, so we're doing tranche work and that kind of thing. And then, in terms of the timing of the project, though we're optimistic we're going to get this\u2026 the permit was valid and we'll get that result there. So, we are not identifying any significant impacts in the schedule and we will be updating that as we move forward.", "Unidentified Participants", "Okay, the projects not on hold until we get the permit then?", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "No.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. That's all for me. Thanks.", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "Yes.", "Operator", "This does conclude the mean time that we have set aside for questions, and at this time I'd like to turn the conference back for any the closing or additional comments.", "Henry Hubble - Vice President of Investor Relations, Secretary", "I would just like to thank everybody for the time and questions and look forward to next quarter.

Bernstein & Company, Inc.", "Mark Gilman \u2013 The Benchmark Company", "Erik Mielke \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Jason Gammel \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities", "[Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Company]", "Robert Kessler \u2013 Simmons & Company International", "", "Operator", "Good day everyone and welcome to the Exxon Mobil corporation third quarter 2008 earnings conference call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead sir.", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning and welcome to Exxon Mobil\u2019s teleconference and webcast on our third quarter 2008 financial and operating results. As you are aware from this morning\u2019s press release Exxon Mobil\u2019s net income in the third quarter was a record for the corporation. Our integrated business portfolio, strong operational performance, and financial discipline continue to allow us to capture the benefits of the commodity price environment.", "Despite recent volatility in the financial, commodity, and credit markets the fundamentals at Exxon Mobil\u2019s business remain strong and we continue to invest are record levels to bring new supplies to market.", "Before we go further I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement. Please note that estimates, plans, and expectations are forward-looking statements. Actual results, including resource recoveries, volume growth, and project outcomes could differ materially due to factors I discuss and factors noted in our SEC filings. Please see factors affecting future results and the Form 8-K we furnished this morning, which are available through the Investors section of our website.", "Please also see the frequently used terms, the supplements to this morning's press release, and the 2007 financial and operating review on our website. This material defines key terms I will use today, shows Exxon Mobil's net interest in specific projects, and includes our SEC Regulation G disclosure.", "Now, I'm pleased to turn your attention to the third quarter results. Exxon Mobil's third quarter 2008 net income was $14.8 billion, an increase of $5.4 billion from the third quarter of 2007. Third quarter 2008 net income included a $1.6 billion gain on the sale of our German gas transportation business which we commented on in our second quarter earnings teleconference and a special charge of $170 million for interest related to the Valdez punitive damages award.", "Third quarter normalized earnings, excluding special items, were $13.4 billion, up almost 4 billion from the third quarter of 2007. Normalized earnings per share were $2.59 per share, up 52% from a year ago, reflecting the strong earnings performance and the benefits of our share purchase program.", "During the third quarter of 2008, Exxon Mobil distributed a total of 10.1 billion to shareholders, including dividends of 2.1 billion and share purchased to reduce shares outstanding of $8 billion.", "Before I discuss our specific business results in more detail, I would like to make a few comments on the impact of the hurricanes which hit the Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana in September. Hurricanes Gustav and Ike were significant events for our employees, their families, and many communities across the Gulf Coast. Our top priority was the safety of our employees and the communities in which we operate. Our response plan and the diligence of our employees ensured the safe shutdown of platforms, refineries, and chemical plants in the path of the hurricanes.", "As part of our preparation and activities we worked diligently to bring additional fuel supply to our customers. For example we sourced gasoline from oversees and also purchased volumes in the U.S. to supplement our own production. In addition, Exxon Mobil has provided a total of $6.8 million in relief to help communities directly affected by the hurricanes. The majority of our upstream production operations and downstream refineries are now back online or completing the final stages of startup. However, the Beaumont chemical plant experienced more extensive water damage than our other facilities. And we continue to progress repairs and develop our restar plans.", "As a result of the hurricanes third quarter upstream volumes were down 24,000 oil equivalent barrels per day and costs were higher by $50 million before tax. Looking forward we expect damage repairs and lower volumes across all business lines associated with the hurricanes to reduce earnings by about $500 million in the fourth quarter.", "I would now like to share some of the milestones we have achieved since the last earnings call. Following the startup of the Mondo field in January this year we successfully started up the Saxi and Batuque fields in the third quarter, completing the second Kizomba C FPSO startup in Block 15 offshore Angola. The three fields comprising the Kizomba C development, Mondo, Saxi, and Batuque are now producing at a combined rate of 200,000 barrels per day and are expected to recover approximately 600 million barrels of oil. Daily production from the Exxon Mobil operated Block 15 developments in Angola has now reached approximately 700,000 barrels per day.", "In Malaysia natural gas production commenced from the offshore Journa (ph 00:06:12) B platform. The platform was fully designed and constructed in Malaysia. At its peak, this development should produce 150 million cubic feet per day bringing expected total production for the Journa field to 600 million cubic feet per day.", "Including Volvay (ph 00:06:33) in Norway, Starling in the U.K. sector of the North Sea, Kizomba C Mondo in Angola, East Area Natural Gas Liquids II offshore Nigeria, and ACG Phase III in Azerbaijan we have completed seven major project startups to date in 2008. In addition to these startups, a major expansion was completed in the third quarter at the Tengiz field in Kazakhstan with the full startup at the sour gas injection second generation plant. This expansion increased Tengiz\u2019s production capacity by 235,000 barrels per day, nearly doubling production capacity to 540,000 barrels per day. These major projects demonstrate our ongoing commitment to bring new supplies to market and deliver value to our shareholders.", "Also in the third quarter we announced that the Adriatic LNG terminal left its construction site in Spain and arrived in Italy successfully. Following a period of commissioning and testing, the terminal should reach full operational capacity in 2009. Once operational the terminal will have a regassification capacity of 8 billion cubic meters per year, equal to approximately 10% of Italy\u2019s national natural gas consumption, and about 10% of installed LNG regassification capacity in Europe.", "In exploration we added to our global portfolio of outstanding deepwater exploration opportunities. In the recent Gulf of Mexico lease sale 207, we were the high bidder for 130 blocks totaling 83,000 acres and water depths ranging from 2,100 feet to almost 10,000 feet.", "In Brazil the deepwater drilling rig West Polaris arrived in Brazilian waters in late September and after concluding the required inspections and clearances has begun drilling the Azula well (ph 00:08:46) in Block BM-S-22. Plans to drill a second well on the block are underway and will follow immediately upon completion of the first well. Exxon Mobil is pleased to be participating in this exciting new subsalt play and will leverage all of our global experience and industry leading technologies in the exploration program.", "Also in exploration we continue to progress our high potential unconventional natural gas opportunities in Europe and North America. In both the lower Saxony Basin in Germany and the Mako Trough in southeast Hungary we began drilling operations and will conduct production tests over the next several months.", "In the Horn River Basin in Northeastern British Columbia, Canada we captured an additional 21,000 acres in the area bringing our total to 136,000 acres. Drilling in the Horn River area will commence during the fourth quarter.", "Moving now to the downstream, in refining we continue our activities to reduce raw material costs by managing our crude flexibility. This quarter Exxon Mobil ran 44 crudes that were new to individual refineries and eight that were new to the corporation. Also during the quarter in our lubricants business, we introduced our new aviation hydraulic fluid Hijet-5. Hijet-5 is the only product of its type with the highest grade approvals from Airbus and Boeing and demonstrates our commitment to develop technologically advanced products for our customers.", "In our chemical business we started up facilities at our plant in Pensacola, Florida to manufacture a revolutionary new tire material excore dynamically vulcanized alloy or DVA. Excore DVA achieved 7 to 10 times better air permeability than existing halibutal tire inter-liner materials. This allows for improved tire durability and better air pressure retention which improves vehicle fuel economy.", "Building on the strength of our integrated facilities and demonstrating our disciplined investment approach, we also started up facilities in our plant in Singapore to increase EXOL hydrocarbon fluid\u2019s production. These facilities will increase capacity at the site by 130,000 tons per year to more than 500,000 tons per year, allowing us to meet growing demand for differentiated hydrocarbon fluid products in Asia Pacific. This expansion reinforces Singapore\u2019s status as a world class hydrocarbon fluid\u2019s complex along with Exxon Mobil\u2019s facilities in Baytown, Texas and Antwerp, Belgium.", "Now turning to the business line results, upstream earnings in the third quarter excluding special items were $9.4 billion, up 3.1 billion from the third quarter of 2007. We continue to capture the benefit of strong industry conditions during the quarter, generating upstream after tax unit earnings of $28.27 per barrel.", "Crude oil and natural gas realizations increased earnings by $4.4 billion. Worldwide crude oil realizations were up more than $40 per barrel to just over $111 per barrel in the quarter. Natural gas realizations were up $3.82 per KCF from third quarter 2007 reflecting higher prices in all major producing regions. Lower crude oil and natural gas volumes reduced earnings by $1.3 billion.", "Other effects reduced earnings by $50 million primarily due to increased operating expense and higher taxes partly offset by positive foreign exchange effects and higher gains from asset sales. In total oil equivalent volumes decreased 8% from the third quarter of last year. Entitlement volume effects including price and spend impacts and PSC net interest reductions reduced volumes by 110,000 barrels per day. Excluding the impacts of lower entitlement volumes and also the hurricane impacts in the U.S. production was down 4.8%. This reduction includes the impact of higher maintenance activity and downtime which reduced volumes by just under 3%.", "Natural field decline in mature areas was largely offset by major project ramp-ups in West Africa and the North Sea. Liquids production decreased approximately 250,000 barrels per day, or 10% from the third quarter of last year. Excluding impacts related to lower entitlement volumes and hurricane impacts in the U.S. production was down about 5%. This reduction includes the impact of higher maintenance activity and natural field decline in mature areas largely offset by major project ramp-ups in West Africa and the North Sea.", "Gas volumes decreased 460 million cubic feet per day from the third quarter 2007. Natural field decline in mature areas along with increased maintenance activity and entitlement effects were partly offset by new project volumes.", "Turning now to the sequential comparison, versus the second quarter of 2008 upstream earning decreased $660 million due to lower crude oil realizations and higher expenses partly offset by increased gains from asset sales and positive foreign exchange effects.", "Liquids production decreased 4% due to entitlement volume effects, natural field decline, and hurricane impacts in the U.S. partly offset by new project volumes. Natural gas production was down nearly 8% driven by seasonally lower demand in Europe, higher maintenance activity, hurricane impacts in the U.S., and natural field decline. Oil equivalent volumes were down 5.5% from the second quarter. For further data on regional volumes please refer to the press release and IR supplement.", "Turning now to the downstream results, earnings in the third quarter were $3 billion, up $1 billion from the third quarter of 2007. Higher margins increased margins by $1.1 billion driven by stronger refining and marketing margins including positive price finalization effects of just over $700 million. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $210 million as margin improvement activities more than offset lower sales volumes. Other effects reduced earnings by $270 million primarily due to negative foreign exchange effects.", "Sequentially third quarter earnings increased by $1.5 billion reflecting stronger refining and marketing margins including positive price finalization effects of just over $1 billion. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $90 million including the impact of ongoing margin improvement activities. Other factors reduced earnings by $450 million largely due to adverse foreign exchange impacts and lower gains from asset sales.", "Focusing now on our chemical results, third quarter chemical earnings of $1.1 billion were $115 million lower than the third quarter of 2007. Lower margins reduced earnings by 55 million while lower volumes reduced earnings by $200 million, reflecting hurricane impacts in the U.S. and lower demand. Other impacts increased earnings by $140 million, reflecting positive foreign exchange and tax effects.", "Sequentially third quarter chemical earnings increased by $400 million. Higher margins reflecting increased realizations improved earnings by $630 million. This was partly offset by lower volumes which reduced earnings by $280 million.", "Turning now to our corporate and financing segment, corporate and financing expenses were $71 million excluding the Valdez interest charge down 21 million from a year ago primarily due to positive tax effects. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 45%.", "Our cash balance was $37 billion and debt was $10 billion at the end of the third quarter. Exxon Mobil made share purchases in excess of dilution of $8 billion during the quarter, reducing the number of shares outstanding by 2.1%, again demonstrating our commitment to return cash to our shareholders.", "CAPEX in the third quarter was $6.9 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion, or 26% from the third quarter of 2007. We continue to invest actively in robust projects to help meet global demand for crude oil, natural gas, and finished products.", "In summary, this quarter\u2019s results highlight the quality of our integrated business model and disciplined investment approach. In the upstream our outstanding portfolio of producing assets is performing well. While volumes were impacted by the price environment and higher maintenance activity, operational performance was solid and we delivered strong earnings in the quarter.", "In downstream and chemical, Exxon Mobil\u2019s integrated operations and continued focus on efficiency improvement and optimization allowed us to deliver differentiated results. That concludes my prepared remarks. I would now be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "Thank you sir. (Operator Instructions) We will go first to Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Hi, good morning everybody.", "David Rosenthal", "", "Good morning Paul.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Looking at these volumes, just a very high level question first of all, at the analyst meeting you said that you would be essentially down very mildly. That was the projection in 2008. And then there would be growth in 2009 all at a level of about 4 million barrels a day. I guess if we add back in the incitement volumes and the hurricanes and the maintenance and so on effectively you\u2019re down about 2%. Should we expect growth from that lower level in 2009 or can you give us some sort of indication of how much flight volumes have been permanently impaired by what\u2019s happened over the past few months relative to what you thought in March? Thanks.", "David Rosenthal", "Well Paul, as you pointed out, if we look at where we are so far this year and you exclude the price related effects and the hurricane impacts and the maintenance we would be down about 2% and that is consistent with the volume outlook that we tabled at the March analyst meeting.", "I would point out that the PSC effects, while they do improve \u2013 do impact volumes, the high price environment on those PSCs has generated substantial returns and we are very pleased with the results out of those PSCs.", "As we move forward into 2009 we will be providing another update at our March analyst meeting. But I would say the projects that we have that are underpinning the volume chart that we showed before are on track and progressing as planned.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "So would you \u2013", "David Rosenthal", "We do expect \u2013 let me just follow-up on one comment \u2013 we do expect growth in \u201909 of course related to the startup of our large cutter LNG trains.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "So we should expect growth \u2013 should we take the new level to be the down 2% and growth from there and disregard the March outlook?", "David Rosenthal", "No, I think what would be more appropriate would be to look at what we tabled in March of this year for the long-term projection and volumes. And again we\u2019ll provide an update to that at the next analyst meeting in March.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Just breaking down into the PSC effects I guess some of those lower volumes have gone forever but some of them are price related and will come back. Can you give us a sense of the breakdown of how much the PSC effects were? Even if you could that regionally it would be very helpful as well just so that we can get a sense of how big that number will be on a trailing and going forward basis.", "David Rosenthal", "Sure. If we look at the volumes of third quarter \u201908 versus third quarter of \u201907 we mentioned that the total impact is about 110,000 barrels per day. And about 57,000 barrels per day does represent net interest reductions which are permanent and the other 53 do represent the price and spend impacts which of course as you know are related to the price of oil at the time we recover those barrels to cover our costs and those will vary with crude prices.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "Okay.", "David Rosenthal", "", "And if I just follow up on your last question.  About 40% of the total was in the Russia Caspian area, about a third in West Africa and little across the rest of our portfolio.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "And the prices would just stay flat from here.  How would we model back in the line for what you just said about the permanent reduction?  How would we model back in the (inaudible 00:16:29) on the sensitive side of that.", "David Rosenthal", "", "Well, the - of course the net interest reductions are permanent and won\u2019t be impacted by the prices going forward whether they go up or down.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "Right.", "David Rosenthal ", "", "And then of course, the price and spend impacts will depend on both the level of our costs and spend patterns as well as the price of oil at the time.  But again, those are variable both from what our spending profile looks like as well as the absolute value of the oil.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "So you can\u2019t give me a sense, say for example, if we held that 665 or whatever we\u2019re at today.  If we held that level can you give me a sense of - for where we\u2019d be?", "David Rosenthal", "", "I really wouldn\u2019t want to try to give us a sense cause again, that\u2019s dependent on both the price of the oil and our level of spend.  But directionally lower prices, you know would yield more barrels at the same level of spending but I really wouldn\u2019t want to try to table a number going forward.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "On the maintenance activity and down time, that\u2019s kind of a special item that recurs.  Is there a pattern here that we do see high levels of maintenance and we should, in many ways, consider those, for example North Sea issues to be a permanent feature of life in a mature world of oil going forward?", "David Rosenthal", "", "Well, as you know, historically maintenance is higher in the second and third quarters.  And as you know, we have a very robust and disciplined system of doing our maintenance and that does, as I mentioned, tend to be higher in the second and third quarter.  We had maintenance which was particular higher in the third quarter of this year primarily in Nigeria.  But going forward, you know, I would expect those volumes to come back as we get the majority of that maintenance work behind us heading into the fourth quarter.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "Okay.  So finally, for me, could you just split out how much was Nigeria and how much was North Sea?  How much was, I guess, Tanges (ph 00:18:37) was also down as well?", "David Rosenthal", "", "The bulk of it was in the North Sea and Nigeria with small effects elsewhere but I really wouldn\u2019t want to go into more detail but the bulk of it was in Nigeria and the North Sea and as you know, as we come out of the third quarter the North Sea maintenance for both liquids and gas will be behind us and we\u2019re making progress in Nigeria as well.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "Okay.  I\u2019ll leave it there.  Thank you.", "David Rosenthal", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Neil McMahon of Sanford Bernstein.", "David Rosenthal", "", "Good morning, Neil.", "Neil McMahon \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.", "", "Good morning or even afternoon this side.  A few questions.  The first one is could you give us an update on a few of your longer term potential operations that are what is, as far as I can tell, sort of legal disputes at the minute such as Natuna and on Point Thompson?  And then I\u2019ve got a second question.", "David Rosenthal", "", "All right.  If we look first at Natuna we are continuing to progress that project and you know, we continue to discuss with the government our ongoing project development there and those negotiations are continuing but - and we have certainly communicated to the Indonesian government a willingness to seek a mutually acceptable solution.  And we would expect to continue to work on that over the course of the quarter but I do want to say that there really is no legal dispute at this time for Natuna.  Our contract remains valid and we continue discussions with the government.", "If we move on to Point Thompson, ExxonMobil and the other Point Thompson working interest owners are proceeding with the project while we seek to resolve the dispute with the state over the Point Thompson unit and leases.  We have completed many activities in field operations at the Point Thompson site in preparation for the multi-well drilling program.  We\u2019ve got several of the permits to do that program and we\u2019re awaiting additional approvals from the state regulatory agencies that are necessary to allow drilling activities to continue.", "Neil McMahon \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.", "", "I think that just on Point Thompson, I think there was meant to be some resolution by October 15th.  So I was just wondering if there was any update on that.  And secondly on Natuna, should we then expect Natuna to reappear in your Asono (ph 00:21:22) document on your (inaudible 00:21:26) document in terms of the major projects, start ups for the next decade.", "David Rosenthal", "", "Well, let me hit Point Thompson first.  I\u2019m not aware of any specific October 15th deadline but as I mentioned earlier, we are in ongoing discussions with the state of Alaska on bringing that project forward.  As opposed to Natuna, you know as I mentioned we are looking to progress in Natuna and the outcome of the negotiations that are underway will determine our reporting going forward.", "Neil McMahon \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.", "Just a second question looking at - obviously, your balance sheet is probably one of the best in the world if not the best in the world.", "David Rosenthal", "", "Thank you.", "Neil McMahon \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.", "", "And it\u2019s hardly extreme to say so given the size of it.  And just looking at the amount of cash, you\u2019ve got nearly $37 billion on the balance sheet.  What should we be thinking about your buy back level going forward?  Neither the value of the stock has fallen and also how do you think about acquisitions given current prices for stocks which have fallen dramatically the last few months?", "David Rosenthal", "", "Well, let\u2019s talk about the cash that we have on the balance sheet and let me just step back a second and say, of course, the utilization of that cash in whatever avenue is designed to increase shareholder value over the long-term.  As we look forward, of course our first priority is to fund our very robust investment program and as we\u2019ve mentioned we expect to spend in the league of $25 to $35 billion a year in CapEx over the next five years.  And we have no change to those plans at this time.  The projects are progressing as we expected.  ", "The next thing we fund, of course, is the dividend and we have a history of growing the dividend.  And that is, of course, one of the avenues of distributing cash to the shareholders.  The last means of distributing cash to the shareholders is through the share buyback but I would -- we do that ratably over a long period of time and we don\u2019t speculate on the price.  We\u2019re buying everyday across the time and you know, that program has continued.", "Neil McMahon \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.", "Okay, thank you.", "David Rosenthal", "", "If we just come back to your follow up question related to M&A activity.  I\u2019d like to say that, of course M&A activity, our opportunities are just one of many opportunities that we look at on a continuing basis.  I\u2019ll tell you that was true at $140 a barrel and it\u2019s true at $70 a barrel.  We are monitoring what\u2019s going on in the market but again, M&A is just one opportunity amongst many that we have and in particular, on a global basis that we\u2019re monitoring and looking at it and evaluating on a constant basis.", "Neil McMahon \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Mark Gilman of Benchmark Company.", "David Rosenthal", "", "Good morning, Mark.", "Mark Gilman \u2013 The Benchmark Company", "", "David, good morning.  I had a couple of things I wanted to go over.  Of the net interest reductions cited in your production chart, did any occur in the third quarter precisely?  Looks to me as if that\u2019s just the carry over affect from impacts earlier in the year given that it\u2019s a reduction from a 90 something number in 2Q same basis.", "David Rosenthal", "", "A lot of it is carry over as you suggested but specifically in the third quarter we did see some impacts from net interest deductions.  Although they were small across a number of areas, nothing I would single out individually.", "Mark Gilman \u2013 The Benchmark Company", "Okay.  Can you identify in a $60, $70 a barrel world, where going forward such might be anticipated?", "David Rosenthal", "", "You\u2019re talking about \u2013", "Mark Gilman \u2013 The Benchmark Company", "In interest reductions.", "David Rosenthal", "", "Oh, the permanent net interest reduction?", "Mark Gilman \u2013 The Benchmark Company", "Yeah.", "David Rosenthal", "", "Well, Mark, as you know only about 20% of our production portfolio is under PSEs and going forward, on a particular bice (ph 00:26:00) basis I couldn\u2019t really offer any specifics.  You know, but again there\u2019s the net interest reductions and the price and spend impacts as we go forward.", "Mark Gilman \u2013 The Benchmark Company", "Okay.  Let me try something else.  It looks to me as if there was a massive net working capital increase in the third quarter which given the drop in prices is, to say the least, a bit counterintuitive.  Is that accurate and why did it occur?", "David Rosenthal", "", "If you\u2019re talking about our working capital change sequentially or quarter on quarter?", "Mark Gilman \u2013 The Benchmark Company", "", "Well, I\u2019m just looking at the third quarter specifically, David, and in order to get to that cash flow from operations number indicated in your press release.  About the only way for that to happen would be if there was a significant increase in working capital which I say in a lower, in a falling price environment is counterintuitive.", "David Rosenthal", "", "Well, we did see fairly significant changes in our working capital in the third quarter but those were related to a number of items both on the payable side and the receivable side given the change in the prices.", "Mark Gilman \u2013 The Benchmark Company", "", "Okay, but there was an increase?", "David Rosenthal", "", "Yes.  Yeah, we did see an increase in the quarter.", "Mark Gilman \u2013 The Benchmark Company", "Okay.  Could you - you mentioned in going through the variances in the segments on several occasions the impact of asset sales.  Can you quantify, you know in reasonably specific terms, what the asset sales benefits were?  Or if it\u2019s a negative number, I doubt that, in the third quarter in the various segments.", "David Rosenthal", "", "Well, Mark as we look across the segments in the third quarter.  Basically we had some of our just usual ongoing business.  Don\u2019t have anything specific to highlight in any of these segments with the exception, perhaps, we divest our Barnett Shell business in the upstream as you\u2019re aware of.  The really significant asset sale, of course, was the sale of our upstream gas transportation business in Germany which we did highlight as a special item.  But other than the event I would characterize the rest of our asset sales across the segment as business as usual.", "Mark Gilman \u2013 The Benchmark Company", "Okay.  One final one for me, David.  The $500 million figure cited in the press release, you know in terms of the earnings impact of damage repairs and lower volumes in the fourth quarter.  That just sounds like an awfully large kind of number.  Can you put some color on that in terms of its pieces?  You know particularly given your comment that most of the activity with respect to Beaumont chemical facility, you know, was really back on line.", "David Rosenthal", "", "Well, let me answer the last part of your question first and I\u2019ll come back to the first part.  If we look across our footprint in the Gulf of all of our assets, most of them are back up or will soon be back up.  The one exception is the Beaumont chemical plant where we did sustain a fair amount of damage and that plant is not up.  And we are continuing to progress repairs at those facilities.  ", "If we look back at the $500 million number mentioned in the press release.  That\u2019s split about evenly between loss volumes and also repair costs as we move into the quarter but yeah, it\u2019s about 50/50 on repair costs and volume effects.", "Mark Gilman \u2013 The Benchmark Company", "", "Was the volume effect primarily on the chemical side?", "David Rosenthal", "", "It somewhat in the chemical side but also on the upstream side.   We would expect it as we mentioned we had about 24 KBD down in the third quarter, most of that late in the quarter.  As we move into the fourth quarter on those volumes, while most of our producing facilities are back online, in many cases we are awaiting third party facilities to be up and running.  So our best guess, if we look quarter to quarter, average across the quarter, we\u2019ll be down about the same 24,000 barrels a day.  So the upstream volumes and some of the other volumes, again about half that $500 million with the balance being repair expense for the facilities that were damaged in the hurricane.", "Mark Gilman \u2013 The Benchmark Company", "Thank you, David.", "David Rosenthal", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Erik Mielke of Merrill Lynch.", "David Rosenthal", "", "Good morning, Erik.", "Erik Mielke \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "", "Yeah, good morning.  I apologize I have a bit of a sore throat so if I sound a bit funny that\u2019s the reason for that.  ", "David Rosenthal", "", "Okay.", "Erik Mielke \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Could you give us an update on the Catare (ph 00:31:08) projects specifically on timing and completion?  You previously mentioned that train four should be ramping up in the fourth quarter and train six should be sometime early in 2009.", "David Rosenthal", "", "Sure, I\u2019d be happy to provide an update.  The train four commissioning is proceeding well and we expect to be producing L&G from train four in the winter, of this winter 2008/2009.  Train five, of course, will start up in 2009 and train six, (inaudible 00:31:40) train six will begin commissioning in late 2008 with first L&G production expected in the first part of 2009.  And finally train seven, of course, is projected to start up later in 2009.", "But let me also comment overall on the status of these projects.  As you know, these are the largest L&G trains in the world.  These are great projects for us and they are all progressing as planned, as expected and we expect the production from those to come on as we expected.", "Erik Mielke \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Should we expect a meaningful contribution to volumes in the fourth quarter?", "David Rosenthal", "", "No, I would not expect a meaningful contribution in the fourth quarter but you\u2019ll start to see the ramp up as we head into the first quarter of \u201909.", "Erik Mielke \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "And the amount in those volumes, are you limited to Italy, the U.K. and the U.S.?", "David Rosenthal", "", "Well, I don\u2019t want to really comment on any specific destination of the specific shipments.  We do have some flexibility and of course, the volumes are going to individual markets at any point and time will depend on the conditions and the contractual arrangements in place but other than that, I really wouldn\u2019t want to comment on any specifics of the commercial arrangements.", "Erik Mielke \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "", "Okay and can I ask a very quick extra question on oil sands.", "David Rosenthal", "", "Sure.", "Erik Mielke \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "We\u2019ve seen some of your peers announce delays to various oil sands projects.  Can you just confirm that you\u2019re still happy with your (inaudible 00:33:24) project?", "David Rosenthal", "", "I\u2019d be happy to confirm that because we are happy with the Coral (ph 00:33:30) project.  We\u2019re committed.  Continue to be committed.  As you know the Coral project is an advantaged resource in the oil sands province mainly because of the quality of that resource and the scale of it.  As we looked at Coral from the beginning we did evaluate those economics over a broad range of prices as we do all of our investment opportunities.  And as we look at the economics of Coral going forward, it continues to look like a robust project for us. ", "In fact, as you mentioned, some of the other oil sands projects may be slowing down or whatever.  That could actually provide some benefit to us in respect to lower costs of both raw materials and services given what\u2019s going in some of the major commodity products but again, we are progressing.  The detail designed engineering is underway and long lead procurement items are being advanced.  And we would expect to be in a position to reach a final investment decision sometime in 2009.", "Erik Mielke \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Very good, thank you.", "David Rosenthal", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Jason Gammel of Macquarie.", "David Rosenthal", "", "Good morning, Jason.", "Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research Equities", "Good morning, David.  How are you?", "David Rosenthal", "", "I\u2019m fine, thank you.", "Jason Gammel \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities", "", "I wanted to ask a question about defined product sales.  Year over year they were down about 6% in the quarter.  It seemed to be essentially across all regions.  Would you be able to talk about how much of that was related to maybe divestitures, effects of hurricanes, etc. versus just what you\u2019re seeing in terms of weak demand?", "David Rosenthal", "", "Well, we\u2019re seeing the impact of all of those factors that you mentioned.  Demand is, of course, a piece of that particularly in the OECD countries.  Although, we do still see a little growth in the non-OEC countries but we also, of course, have the effect of the hurricane and we do have some effect of divestments but I wouldn\u2019t want to give any specifics on any of those individually.  It\u2019s a mixture of all of them but I\u2019d say overall, you know, there\u2019s an impact on demand in the OECD countries as well as the other effects we mentioned but pretty much across the board.", "Jason Gammel \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities", "", "Great, thanks.  If I could ask one more on the effect of tax rate, it was down about four percentage points versus what we saw in the first half of the year.  Is that really just primarily a reflection of the relatively higher contribution of down-stream or are there some adjustments and accrual factors we should know about?", "David Rosenthal", "Well, it\u2019s clearly, (inaudible 00:36:24) you hit the nail on the head there.  It is a function to some extent of the higher proportion of down-stream earnings.  The other impact that we have in there relates to our Germany asset sale.  That did carry a low tax rate and so those are the two primary factors in the quarter-to-quarter decrease in our effected tax rate.", "Jason Gammel \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities", "Thank you, David.", "David Rosenthal", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Paul Cheng of Barclays Company.", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning, Paul.", "[Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Company]", "Hey, good morning.  Dave, two simple questions, one, you\u2019re talking about the share buy-back (inaudible 00:37:02) third quarter excluding the (inaudible 00:37:07) effect, you\u2019re buying about eight billion.  Can you tell us what is the run rate for the fourth quarter?  ", "Secondly, I want to see if you can make any comment in terms of overall cost pressure in the industry over the last (inaudible 00:37:23) year have been phenomenal, have you seen any visible signs, you start to crack and coming down?", "David Rosenthal", "Let me hit share buy-back question first.  I really don\u2019t want to provide a forward statement on what are expected share buy-back program will look like in the fourth quarter.  As we look at the cost structure, yes, commodity prices are coming down.  For example, steel, concrete, cooper, and other commodities and while it is a little early to tell the extent and timing effect of those prices on our business and our projects in particular, I can tell you that we are actively chasing the lag out of that process and working hard to realize and deliver any cost savings that the market may generate as quickly as possible and as I mentioned earlier, particular on some of our major projects that are just now getting underway, we\u2019ll be working very hard to ensure that the lower cost we\u2019re seeing in some of these goods and services does translate directly into lower costs of those projects to the extent possible.", "[Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Company]", "Dave, if I could, just follow-up on that.  On the drilling rate on the deep-water, I think in the past that, if I recall correctly, you only have a commitment up to 2010 so that means that in the event that the (inaudible 00:38:54) rates start to come down, you should be able to take advantage on that.  Is that a true statement or do you actually have commitment beyond 2010 already?", "David Rosenthal", "Well, rather then picking any particular year, what I would say overall is we are only committed to the extent that we have firm obligations.  For example, we\u2019ve just taken delivery of two new rigs and one of them, as I mentioned, is drilling the well in Brazil as we speak.  What happens going forward with rig rates and other expenses, you know, we\u2019ll just have to see how that shakes out going forward.  But, I think what you\u2019ll see is a lot of our commitment wells over the next couple of years are going to covered by the two new rigs that we\u2019ve just taken delivery on as we continue to actively explore some of the outstanding exploration prospects that we have underway.", "[Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Company]", "Dave, final one, go back to your earlier question, you don\u2019t want to give a number for the fourth quarter, understandable for the share buy-back.  Can you tell us what is your (inaudible 00:40:10) in October?", "David Rosenthal", "No, I really don\u2019t want to give any kind of a run rate.  While we mentioned what the total purchases were in the third quarter and I\u2019ll probably just leave at that.", "[Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Company]", "Okay, thanks.", "David Rosenthal", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And as a reminder it\u2019s star 1 if you would like to signal for a question.  We\u2019ll go next to Robert Kessler of Simmons & Company.", "Robert Kessler \u2013 Simmons & Company International", "Good morning, David.", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning Robert, how are you?", "Robert Kessler \u2013 Simmons & Company International", "Good.  This might be more of a nuance question but you mentioned a couple of times now that the inflationary trends that you\u2019re seeing in the capital investment side of things and then you\u2019ve reiterated this $25 to $30 billion per year spending for the next five years.  I\u2019m assuming that was calibrated giving consideration to the inflationary environment we witnessing at the time.  So, just as you think about that program in the new environment, should we expect you to perhaps to spend less with the same activity to the extend deflation occurs or would you sort of pick up your activity to take advantage of the lower costs and then fill the gap and spend the same amount?", "David Rosenthal", "Well, that\u2019s a good question and if you look at our major projects that are underway or in the early stages, these are very long-term large scale projects.  And as I mentioned earlier, when we\u2019re analyzing and evaluating those projects, we do look at them over a fairly broad range of prices and they are robust again across that range.  As we look out into the future, we\u2019re just going to need to just see what the impact is of these costs and how quickly they come through and what impact they have on the projects.  But I would like to say overall, that we pursue investment opportunities, we don\u2019t have spend target, if we mention the $25 to $30 billion a year going forward, that\u2019s not a target that\u2019s an outcome or an expectation that\u2019s generated from the project portfolio that we\u2019re pursuing.  And as we continue to pursue that portfolio of projects, whatever impact, or help we get on prices will be realized in that.  But again, we will be pursing all investment opportunities that we view as being robust and generate long term shareholder value.", "Robert Kessler \u2013 Simmons & Company International", "Makes sense, thanks, David.", "David Rosenthal", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go back to Neil McMahon of Sanford Bernstein.", "Neil McMahon \u2013 Sanford C.

I think the idea was around the end of the year, start of next year?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, as I mentioned the well has spudded and we would expect that well to be down by the end of the year, first of next year.", "Neil McMahon \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.", "And I know you\u2019re last vocal any many of your peers especially the smaller NP companies, would you be making any announcements around about that time?", "David Rosenthal", "You know I wouldn\u2019t want to speculate on exactly when we\u2019ll make an announcement but as soon as we\u2019re ready and have information to provide, we\u2019ll make that announcement.", "Neil McMahon \u2013 Sanford C.

And while Nigeria was a major factor,  I wouldn\u2019t really want to single it out and give a specific number.  But just to say that of that 100,000 barrels that we talked about, the two biggest impacts were your normal third quarter North Sea maintenance and Nigeria, but I think the key thing for us is that maintenance work has been successful and as we go forward we\u2019d be expecting to see those volumes coming back.", "Mark Gilman \u2013  The Benchmark Company", "Okay, could you provide absolute price finalization numbers for the third quarter split US and foreign?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure, I\u2019d be happy to provide that for you.  If we look at the absolute values for the price finalization in the third quarter of 08, we were about $600 million in total, about two thirds of that U.S. and about a third of that non-U.S.", "Mark Gilman \u2013  The Benchmark Company", "Thank you, David.", "David Rosenthal", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "(Operator instructions)  We\u2019ll go back to Jason Gammel of Macquarie.", "Jason Gammel \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities", "David, I just wanted to complete the loop on the LNG infrastructure progress, can you talk about Golden Pass, where you\u2019re at in terms of construction and when you expect to have first cargos in that facility?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure, as you know, Golden Pass is our larger LNG regasication (misspelled? 00:45:42) project in the U.S.  It\u2019s progressing along on schedule.  We did have some hurricane impacts on the project and we\u2019re assessing the impact of that and determining what restorative work will be needed.  But I have to say we are still in the assessment stage and not prepared to give any specific indications on cost impact or schedule.  We\u2019re working through all of that and we\u2019ll provide an update as we have more information.", "Jason Gammel \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities", "Thanks and if I could just one more on Golden Path, should we think of that as a terminal that will essentially have very steady (inaudible 00:46:28) volumes or will this be a facility that just takes advantage of price arbitrage in the North American market versus the other markets that you serve?", "David Rosenthal", "Well, I wouldn\u2019t want to make a prediction on any type of a short-term basis.  As you know, all of our LNG investments across the value chain are long-term in nature and are not subject to short-term variations in prices or supply demand balances.  We do expect some volumes will come into the Golden Pass terminal, but I wouldn\u2019t want to try to give a specific profile especially near-term.  Again, if we think longer term the U.S. is going to need more LNG and we feel like we\u2019re well positioned to meet that need from a number of standpoints including LNG out of cutter into our Golden Path terminal.  But again, it\u2019s a very long-term project meeting a very long-term need for gas into the U.S.", "Jason Gammel \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities", "Okay, appreciate it that, David, thanks.", "David Rosenthal", "Thank you.", "Operator", "That\u2019s all the time we have for questions, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rosenthal for any additional or closing remarks.", "David Rosenthal", "Thank you very much.

The current environment has created challenging business conditions for many industries and has also affected millions of consumers worldwide. Despite these challenges, ExxonMobil remains well positioned for the future as a direct result of our financial strength, long-term focus, effective approach to risk management, and capital discipline.", "Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement. Please note that estimates, plans and expectations are forward-looking statements. Actual results, including resource recovery, volume growth and project outcome could differ materially due to factors I discuss and factors noted in our SEC filing.", "Please see factors affecting future results and the Form 8-K we furnished this morning, which are available through the investor section of our Web site. Please also see the frequently used terms, the supplements to this morning's press release and the 2007 financial and operating review on our Web site. This material defines key terms I will use today, shows ExxonMobil's net interest in specific projects and includes our SEC Regulation G disclosure.", "Now, I am pleased to turn your attention to the fourth quarter results. ExxonMobil's fourth quarter 2008 normalized earnings and net income was $7.8 billion, a reduction of $3.8 billion from the fourth quarter of 2007, versus the third quarter of 2008, normalized earnings were down $5.6 billion and net income decreased $7 billion. Both comparisons reflect the recent sharp reduction in commodity prices. Normalized earnings per share were $1.55, down $0.58 from a year ago.", "During the fourth quarter of 2008, ExxonMobil distributed a total of $10 billion to shareholders, including dividends of $2 billion and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding of $8 billion.", "ExxonMobil's full year 2008 net income was $45.2 billion, up $4.6 billion from 2007 and a record for the Corporation, with strong results in each of our upstream, downstream, and chemical businesses. Normalized earnings for 2008 were also a record at $44.1 billion, up $3.5 billion from 2007.", "I would now like to share some of the milestones we have achieved since the last earnings call. In December, the Thunder Horse Project in the Gulf of Mexico achieved a production rate of over 200,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. The project at peak is expected to produce 250,000 barrels per day of crude oil and 200 million cubic feet per day of natural gas.", "Including Thunder Horse, Volve in Norway, Starling in the U.K. sector of the North Sea, Kizomba C Mondo, and Saxi Batuque in Angola, East Area and Natural Gas Liquids in Nigeria, Journey B in Malaysia and ACG Phase Three in Azerbaijan, we completed eight major project start-ups during 2008.", "Also, during the fourth quarter, we started up the offshore facilities for the Qatargas II Train 4 project in Qatar. We are completing commissioning activities onshore and we anticipate first LNG from the project during the first quarter of 2009. The South Hook LNG terminal in the U.K. is also in the process of completing commissioning and we expect initial LNG receipt and processing during the fist quarter.", "When full operational capacity is reached, the terminal will have the capability to supply 2 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day to the U.K. market. The fourth quarter also saw the completion of four new Q-Max class LNG carriers, the first of their kind. The Q-Max carriers are the largest LNG carriers in the world and can transport about 80% more cargo than a standard carrier.", "These vessels mark a step change in LNG shipping by lowering unit transportation cost while improving energy efficiency and reducing emissions. These groundbreaking improvements were made possible by applying the latest LNG shipping technology developed by ExxonMobil and our partner Qatar Petroleum.", "In December, the Sakhalin-1 project earned the excellence in project integration award from the committees and sponsoring societies of the International Petroleum Technology Conference or IPTC held in Kuala Lumpur. The award is a testament to ExxonMobil\u2019s achievements in successfully executing the project in one of the most challenging Arctic environments in the world, in a safe and environmentally responsible manner. These major projects demonstrate our ongoing commitment to bring new supplies to market and deliver value to our shareholders.", "In exploration, we added to our global portfolio of outstanding deepwater opportunities. ExxonMobil entered into an agreement with Turkish national oil company, TPAO to explore two large deepwater blocks in the Black Sea offshore Turkey. These blocks cover total area of 7 million acres. We're awaiting final government approval of this agreement.", "ExxonMobil also signed an agreement with the Romanian oil and gas company Petron to cooperate on a 3D seismic acquisition and evaluation program of the Black Sea Neptune block covering approximately two million acres. This agreement helps strengthen our position in this new exploration play.", "In Brazil, the deepwater drilling rig, West Polaris is currently drilling the Azula well in Block BM-S-22. Plans for additional drilling on the block are underway with a second well to follow upon completion of the first.", "ExxonMobil is pleased to be participating in this new subsalt play and will leverage all of our global experience and industry-leading technologies in the exploration program. We also continue to progress our high potential unconventional natural gas opportunities around the world.", "In the Lower Saxony Basin in Germany, we have drilled three exploration wells in the promising shale gas play there and are preparing to commence testing operations. In the Mako Trough in southeast Hungary, we are now drilling our second and third evaluation wells. Testing operations will begin once we have completed the first set of wells.", "In the Horn River Basin, in northeastern British Columbia, Canada, we also commenced a four well winter drilling and testing program on our extensive shale gas acreage during the fourth quarter.", "Moving now to the downstream, during the quarter, we announced our plans to invest more than $1 billion in our Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Baytown, Texas, and Antwerp Belgium refineries to increase the supply of cleaner burning diesel. These projects include the construction of additional process units and modifications to existing facilities, which will allow us to increase diesel production by 6 million gallons per day at these sites. This increase in production is equivalent to the diesel produced from about four average sized refineries.", "Building on our commitment to technology, ExxonMobil announced in October that we are collaborating with Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne to develop next generation gasification technology to convert coal, coke or biomass to synthesis gas. One of the potential uses of this technology would be to facilitate carbon capture and storage, reducing green house gas emissions from power generation.", "The collaboration takes advantage of ExxonMobil's technology leadership in the energy sector and Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne experienced in rocket engine development, with the goal of making significant progress in gasification technology.", "Also in refining, we continued our activities to reduce raw material cost by managing our crude flexibility. This quarter, ExxonMobil ran 36 crudes that were new to individual refineries and four that were new to ExxonMobil.", "Turning now to our chemical business, in October, ExxonMobil 1, the 2008 ICIS Chemical Business award for best product innovation for our new battery separator film technology.", "During the fourth quarter, we also began construction on a new battery separator film manufacturing facility in Gumi, South Korea. The facility will have the capacity to produce over 30 million square meters of film per year with opportunity for future significant expansion. This ExxonMobil film technology is expected to help improve the efficiency and performance of lithium ion batteries and may lead to future applications in new, hybrid and electric vehicles. This investment will significantly enhance our capability to supply customers in this fast growing market.", "Also during the fourth quarter, we signed heads of agreement with Saudi Basic Industries to progress detailed studies for a new elastomers project at our petro chemical joint ventures located in Kemya and Yanpet, Saudi Arabia.", "The new facilities will supply a combined volume of over 400,000 tons per year of chemical products including synthetic rubber, thermal plastic specialty polymers and other products. This project is part of ExxonMobil's commitment to invest in advantaged, chemical growth projects in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific to meet long-term demand.", "Now turning to the business line results, upstream earnings in the fourth quarter were $5.6 billion, down $2.6 billion from the fourth quarter of 2007. Upstream after-tax unit earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008 were just under $15 per barrel.", "Lower realizations reduced earnings by $2.7 billion, driven by lower crude oil prices which were down $34 per barrel to just under $51 per barrel in the quarter. Natural gas realizations were up $1.46 per kcf from the fourth quarter of 2007, reflecting higher prices in Europe and the Middle East, partly offset by lower realizations in North America.", "Lower volumes reduced earnings by $240 million. Other effects increased earnings by $320 million due primarily to positive foreign exchange effects, higher gains from asset sales and lower taxes, partly offset by increased operating expenses.", "In total, oil equivalent volumes decreased to 3% from the fourth quarter of last year. Entitlement volume effects including price and spend impacts and PSC net interest reductions, reduced volumes by 47,000 barrels per day. Excluding the impact of lower entitlement volumes, quotas and divestments, production was down 1%, driven by lower European natural gas demand.", "Natural fuel decline was largely offset by a major project ramp ups in West Africa, the North Sea and Kazakhstan. Liquids production decreased 45,000 barrels per day or 2% from the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding impacts related to lower entitlement volumes, quotas and divestments, production was up just over 1%. Major project ramp ups in West Africa, Kazakhstan and the North Sea and lower maintenance activity more than offset natural fuel decline.", "Gas volumes decreased 565 million cubic feet per day from the fourth quarter of 2007. New project volumes in the North Sea, Qatar and Malaysia were more than offset by natural decline and lower demand in Europe.", "Turning now to the sequential comparison versus the third quarter of 2008, upstream earnings decreased $3.7 billion, primarily due to lower crude oil realizations, which were down $60 per barrel in the quarter. Higher crude oil and natural gas volumes increased earnings by $850 million. Other effects benefited earnings by $350 million primarily from higher gains on asset sales.", "Liquids production increased 8% reflecting the impact of new project volumes and the completion of maintenance programs. Natural gas production was up nearly 26% driven by seasonally higher demand in Europe. Oil equivalent volumes were up 14% from the third quarter.", "Looking now at the full year results, 2008 upstream earnings excluding special items were a record $33.8 billion, an increase of $7.3 billion over 2007. Improved realizations increased earnings by $11.8 billion. Crude oil prices were up, over $24 per barrel and natural gas realization increased in all major producing regions.", "Lower crude oil and natural gas volumes reduced earnings by $3.7 billion. Other factors reduced earnings by $800 million with higher expenses, including the impact of new project start-ups and negative tax effects partly offset by positive foreign exchange impacts and higher gains on asset sales.", "Full year oil equivalent volumes were down 6% versus 2007. Liquids volumes were down 8% while natural gas volumes were down 3%. Excluding entitlement volume effects, the Venezuela expropriation and divestments, production was down just under 3%. About half of that reduction was due to higher maintenance activity and the effects of the hurricanes in the U.S., with the balance reflecting natural fuel decline, offset by new project volumes in West Africa, the North Sea, Kazakhstan and Malaysia. For further detail on regional volumes, please refer to the press release and IR supplement.", "Turning now to the downstream results, earnings in the fourth quarter were $2.4 billion, up $150 million from the fourth quarter of 2007. Higher margins increased earnings by $890 million, with stronger marketing and industry refining margins and positive price finalization effects partly offset by impacts due to temporary inventory changes.", "Volume and mix effects reduced earnings by $230 million, driven primarily by lower sales volume. Other effects reduced earnings by $510 million, reflecting adverse foreign exchange impacts and higher operating expenses including hurricane related repair costs.", "Sequentially, fourth quarter earnings decreased by $600 million. Lower margins reduced earnings by $980 million, driven by weaker refining margins including negative impacts due to temporary inventory changes partly offset by improved marketing margins. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $40 million with margin improvement activities more than offsetting lower sales volumes. Other factors increased earnings by $340 million including $190 million of positive LIFO effects and higher earnings from asset sales.", "Full year 2008 downstream earnings were $8.2 billion, down $1.4 billion from record earnings in 2007. Lower margins reduced earnings by $910 million due to weaker refining margins which more than offset improved marketing margins. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $560 million, primarily due to positive margin improvement activities. Other factors reduced earnings by $1.1 billion reflecting higher operating expenses and negative foreign exchange effects.", "Now turning to our chemical results, fourth quarter chemical earnings were $155 million, down $960 million from the fourth quarter of 2007. Weaker margins reduced earnings by $270 million reflecting lower realizations while volume effects reduced earnings by $360 million due to lower demand and the impact of the hurricanes in the U.S. Other effects reduced earnings by $330 million, including hurricane related repair costs and negative foreign exchange effects, partially offset by positive LIFO impacts.", "Sequentially, fourth quarter chemical earnings decreased by $930 million. Weaker margins reduced earnings by $240 million and lower volumes decreased earnings by $370 million, both reflecting impacts of the economic slowdown. Other effects were negative, $320 million with adverse foreign exchange effects and hurricane related repair cost partly offset by positive LIFO effects.", "Full year 2008 chemical earnings were just under $3 billion, down 1.6 billion from record earnings in 2007. Weaker margins reduced earnings by $1.2 billion while lower volumes decreased earnings by $530 million.", "Turning now to our corporate and financing segment, corporate and financing expenses during the quarter were $383 million versus earnings of $77 million in the fourth quarter last year. The increase reflects the absence of positive tax effects and reduced interest income due to lower interest rates. Full year 2008 expenses were $830 million, up from $23 million in 2007, reflecting negative tax effect and lower interest income.", "The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 46%. And for the full year 2008, the effective tax rate was 47%. At the end of the fourth quarter, our cash balance was $31 billion and debt was $9 billion. The corporation distributed $10 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $8 billion was distributed to purchase shares in excess of dilution, reducing the number of shares outstanding by 2.2%.", "For the full year 2008, we distributed a total of $40 billion to shareholders including $32 billion to purchase shares in excess of dilution, which reduced shares outstanding by 7.5% further demonstrating our commitment to return cash to our shareholders.", "Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $7 billion in the first quarter of 2009. CapEx in the fourth quarter was $6.8 billion, an increase of 11% from fourth quarter 2007 and brings 2008 full year CapEx to $26.1 billion. This is in line with our previous guidance and it increased a $5 billion from 2007. We continue to invest at record level in robust projects to help meet global demand for crude oil, natural gas and finished products.", "In summary, these results reflect the strength of ExxonMobil's business model. The volatile business conditions in 2008 demonstrate that our long-term commitment to the integrity of our operations, disciplined investment approach and integrated business model continue to deliver superior results.", "Finally, I would like to mention two upcoming events. First, in mid-February, we will be releasing our 2008 reserves performance data. And second, as many of you who already have seen, our analyst meeting this year will take place on Thursday, March 5th. This will include a live audio webcast beginning at 9:00 a.m. Eastern, 8:00 a.m. Central Time. ExxonMobil's presenters will be led by Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson.", "That concludes my prepared remarks. I would now be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Rosenthal. (Operator instructions). We'll take our first question from Christina Chen with Barclays Capital.", "Christina Chen - Barclays Capital", "Hi, good morning. I just had a quick question. Were there any asset sales gains in the quarter and can you break down the effects in the inventory gains?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes. Good morning, Christina.", "Christina Chen - Barclays Capital", "Good morning.", "David Rosenthal", "Yes. In the other bar, we do have some asset sales. In total, fourth quarter of '08 reflects a positive earnings of impacts from Brazil, Spain and Portugal affiliate sales. And in the downstream, we had a number of minor asset sales as well. Christina, did you have another question?", "Christina Chen - Barclays Capital", "Actually, is it possible to give out the actual number for that?", "David Rosenthal", "No. We don't typically disclose the actual earnings effects from our asset sales.", "Christina Chen - Barclays Capital", "Okay. And then were there any other effects in inventory effects?", "David Rosenthal", "We did have some LIFO effects in the quarter in the downstream. They were fairly minor if you're looking fourth quarter versus the fourth quarter '08 that is, versus the fourth quarter of '07. It was just under $100 million of negative LIFO effects.", "Christina Chen - Barclays Capital", "Okay. Thank you.", "David Rosenthal", "Alright. Thank you.", "Operator", "(Operator instructions). We'll take our next question from Shin Kim [ph] with Merrill Lynch.", "Shin Kim - Merrill Lynch", "Hi, actually I think the question was answered. Thank you.", "David Rosenthal", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Neil McMahon with Sanford Bernstein.", "Neil McMahon - Sanford Bernstein", "Hi, I was wondering if you could go through some of the new projects both in Brazil and in Hungary. I know its sort of early days, but you did go through or at least fit through to the Brazilian authorities that you had discovered oil in block 22. I was wondering if you could give us some more details there and indeed the quality of the oil or oil traces that were discovered?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, of course. We are drilling the Azula well in the ExxonMobil operated BMS-22 block. We continue to drill ahead in that block. We did file a discovery notice on January 16th with the Brazilian authorities. But this is a notice just that we had encountered hydrocarbons, but that is the extent of the notice.", "Neil McMahon - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. So you're not going any further than that?", "David Rosenthal", "No, at this time, we really don't have any other comments to make on Brazil other than we are drilling ahead and progressing with that well. Neil, I think you also asked a question about Hungary.", "Neil McMahon - Sanford Bernstein", "Yes.", "David Rosenthal", "As you recall, last year, we did announce that we had signed an agreement to begin phase work program in the Mako Trough in Hungary on about 184,000 acres. The first two of those wells have spud last year and the second well spud in December and we continue to explore and work on that prospect.", "Neil McMahon - Sanford Bernstein", "And just a very final one, maybe it's a quick one. In terms of the LNG coming to South Hook, are you planning to take it from Qatar with some of the new boats or could it be any sort of boat just to start up the regas facility?", "David Rosenthal", "No. We would be using our new Q-Max ships for that purpose, and the Q-Max and the Q flag ships.", "Neil McMahon - Sanford Bernstein", "Great. And then just a very final one to squeeze it in, in terms of your buyback, the run rate is dropping going to 7 billion, which is still pretty impressive. Are we to presume that over the course of the year that you're going to manage the buyback rate as you\u2019ve said over time and still maintain your dividend group of policy?", "David Rosenthal", "Well, without providing any specific guidance on the buyback as we've talked about in the past, they are flexible. They are the fly wheel for the use of our cash after funding our robust investment program and our dividend. I really don't have any guidance to give today going forward other than what I stated. We do expect to spend $7 billion in the first quarter of this year.", "Neil McMahon - Sanford Bernstein", "Great. Thank you.", "David Rosenthal", "Thank you.", "Operator", "(Operator instructions). We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank", "Hi, good morning.", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning. How are you?", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank", "Good. Thanks. I have a quick question on, if you can help me out at all on U.S. refining or just refining numbers in general. There is tremendous volatility. I\u2019m bit surprised that you lost money in the U.S. downstream and made so much money in the international downstream. Can you -- especially given the performance of some of your peers throughout this week, can you help us out at all to understand kind of the refining dynamics that are going on and maybe a little bit of guidance for what we should expect going forward?", "David Rosenthal", "I'd like to certainly talk about the fourth quarter. If we look at the fourth quarter '08 versus the fourth quarter '07, in total, the margin effect as I mentioned was a positive about $890 million. And this was driven by stronger non-U.S. margins with improvements both in non-U.S. refining and marketing margins. Overall, U.S. margins were actually down and that was driven by weaker refining margins across the quarter. And that was the primary driver. If you look at the earnings particularly in the U.S., note at the bottom of our chart, that change in earnings across the quarter again was driven by significantly lower refining margins.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. So there is nothing from a quarter-on-quarter basis that in terms of just volatility in the numbers from rapid price movements, is there anything else that we should be aware of?", "David Rosenthal", "Well, yes, there are some effects included in there as you know. Changes in prices over time can have some price finalization impacts as well as impacts due to temporary changes in inventory across the year. But it is driven by overall again lower refining margins. Going forward, we really don't have any guidance going forward. A lot of factors are weighing on both demand and margins on downstream products and we'll be monitoring those as the next several months progress.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank", "While we're talking refining, can I actually check in as well on any potential exposure that you might have to the strike down in the Gulf Coast or that potential strike down on the Gulf Coast are you exposed?", "David Rosenthal", "We have a total of four refineries that have United Steel Workers and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Agreement. And in these four refineries, they expire at the end of the month. These refineries are Beaumont, Chalmette, Torrence and Billings. And if you look at the status of the discussions, ExxonMobil is currently engaged in active negotiations with the union. I really wouldn't consider it appropriate to discuss any specifics of the proposal other than the negotiations are ongoing.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank", "That's great. Thanks. And if I could just sneak in one more, Neil asked you about the gas prospects over there in Hungary and you mentioned as well drilling in Germany. Would it be possible to -- from the wells you\u2019ve drilled so far to make any comparisons to gas assets that we see here in the U.S. in terms of reserve, flow rates or just how you view those assets versus gas assets here in the U.S.?", "David Rosenthal", "No. I wouldn't want to make any direct comparisons other than to say that although it's a little early, we do view the prospects that we have in Germany as potentially world class resources, but we're still evaluating and testing programs are underway, and we'll be testing the wells that we drilled and determining the extent of that resource.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank", "Great. Thanks. I appreciate it.", "David Rosenthal", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Howard Weil.", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning, Doug.", "Doug Leggate - Howard Weil", "Can you hear me?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, good morning, Doug.", "Doug Leggate - Howard Weil", "Hi, how are you guys doing?", "David Rosenthal", "And welcome back.", "Doug Leggate - Howard Weil", "Thanks. I think you might have a little bit of competition this morning. So, David, I've got a couple of things. I don't know if you broke out in your prepared remarks, but it looks like you recaptured quite a bit of volume from production sharing contracts and some of your PSC centered areas. And obviously, all prices have come down a little below the average for the quarter again (inaudible) so far in Q1. Can you just give us an update on your sensitivity to volume recapture (inaudible) expression on from PSCs and I've got an unrelated follow-up?", "David Rosenthal", "Okay, sure. If we look at our volumes first, fourth quarter '08 versus fourth quarter '07, we did still see about 47,000 barrels a day overall negative from PSC effects. Most of that in net interest reductions and a little on the price and spend as we noted. I will say as we look at that sequential increase that we saw in volumes from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. As you would expect with prices declining, we did get a little help on the price and spend side of that equation and really didn't see any net interest reductions. But in that sequential increase we did see the impact of the lower prices on the price and spend component as you would have expected.", "Doug Leggate - Howard Weil", "(inaudible). Excluding the (inaudible) effects of those entitlements, is the actual price of the cost recovery element, the price sensitivity, if you like, is that largely washed through now or do you still have a little more that you'd like to see come back again in Q1?", "David Rosenthal", "On an ongoing basis in any quarter on the price and spend impacts, that will be determined on both the pricing at the time as well as our spend levels, but that again that will be variable. But I would expect the first quarter given if the prices stay the same would be about similar.", "Doug Leggate - Howard Weil", "Okay. Great. And my follow-up, David, is, is this really just an observation? I'm trying to understand the mechanics of what's going on with your costs. Because like everyone you've talked about how costs have been going up and so on. But if you look at the average oil price in the quarter, we will leave realization to decide for a second and look at the same the last time we had an average oil price all of that level was under that Q1 '07. Your net income on a per barrel basis is almost exactly the same which kind of suggests that either there has been a mixed change in improvement or that you've been able to recapture or go back some of the cost increases. Can you just talk about what's going on in the cost side and how those earnings would remain so resilient over the last couple of years?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, let's talk about the cost side for just a minute. As you're well aware, the industry has seen significant upward pressure over the last couple of years in a fairly heated market for supplies and services, and we've not been immune to that, of course. But we have been able to mitigate a great deal of that through our global procurement organization, our focus on operations excellence and efficiency in our operations. So while we've seen the impact of those increases, we don't think it's been as big as it has perhaps on others. I would also offer that one of the things we're seeing here is the benefit of some of our technology advantages across some of our processes -- and the other piece of it would just simply be the mix of where the production is or isn't between any quarter. But I wouldn't have any other specific observation other than to say, they're coming in about as we expected and reflect a lot of the things that we think give us competitive advantages in the industry.", "Doug Leggate - Howard Weil", "Would you be prepared to give us some indication as to year-over-year what your costs look like in a percentage basis?", "David Rosenthal", "I don't think I have a direct comparison on a percentage basis, Doug, but I would say if you look at just our earnings impacts on a period to period earnings recs we do see some of the cost increases that we're talking about in there. But again, in terms of significance in any particular quarter, not that significant. Obviously, across the whole year, you'd see a little bigger effect on a business our size. But I really don't have a percentage increase in particular for any segment of the business or the company in whole.", "Doug Leggate - Howard Weil", "Great. I'll leave it there, David. Thanks again.", "David Rosenthal", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our last question from William Ferer with W. H. Reaves & Co.", "William Ferer - W. H. Reaves & Co.", "Good morning.", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning.", "William Ferer - W. H. Reaves & Co.", "Thank you. Last is not always least. Just a couple the Imperial announced the proceeding on Kearl Lake wondering if the Exxon Corp is opposed to Imperial will participate in the program and if so, equal proportion how that might be. And I noticed in your fourth quarter exploration expense down from a year ago, and it leads to maybe two questions. Part A is were you just more successful or was it just a mix effect? And Part B, you mentioned earlier about economic factors, I'm wondering if the economic conditions perhaps in some oil producing nations would open up more opportunities for Exxon to perhaps participate more aggressively than they might have been given an opportunity where price is much higher, economy is much stronger.", "David Rosenthal", "Thank you. Let me see if I can take those in order. Let's start out with Kearl. As you know Kearl is a significant high quality oil sands resource. And that project continues to be progressed. Detailed design and engineering is underway. Long lead time procurement items are being advanced. Site activities are underway. And again, the project is progressing. And that is a project with ExxonMobil affiliates and NIOL.", "If we take a look I believe the next question related exploration expense. It's down, but it's really timing of activities and expenditures. I don't think we draw any other conclusions related to the market. Overall, our activity is higher as reflective of the portfolio that we have and the activity that we have under way to work on that portfolio, but the absolute timing of the expenditures as they're booked really relates to the activity and nothing special there quarter-to-quarter.", "If we look at the economic factors, I think, in particular, you were talking about more opportunities. Let me back up and actually take the economic factors that we're seeing in the business in two perspectives. One of which is the impact on prices of goods and services in our projects as we progress, our portfolio of investment opportunities. As you're well aware, commodity prices have dropped significantly in a number of areas and people are starting to see a little downturn perhaps in some expenses and services. And we're -- although it's a little early to tell the extent that those might provide us, we are actively pursuing for our global procurement and global project development organizations putting pressure on the system to really get the lag out and start to bring those cost reductions to the bottom-line as quickly as possible.", "The other aspect of the current economic environment as you mentioned is the impact it has on resource holders and producing nations. And without being anything particular or specific --", "William Ferer - W. H. Reaves & Co.", "Give real specific, will you?", "David Rosenthal", "I can't give real specific, but I would tell you certainly we are open and always exploring and chasing new opportunities to add value in all of the economic conditions. But it's a little early to tell what impact that's going to have in various scenarios or draw any conclusions other than I can assure you that we are well positioned both from a financial strength standpoint and organization capability standpoint to take advantage of any opportunity that might present itself for whatever reason that might come along. So thanks for the question.", "William Ferer - W. H. Reaves & Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "With that we have no further questions left in the queue. I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Rosenthal for any additional or closing remarks.", "David Rosenthal", "Thank you very much. I appreciate everybody joining the call and your questions. I would like to say, in closing, that despite the challenging economic environment, we remain confident that our long-term perspective, financial strength and disciplined investment approach will continue to deliver superior differentiated results and positions us well for the future.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference.

(NYSE:XOM) Q1 2009 Earnings Call April 30, 2009 11:00 AM ET", "Executives", "David S. Rosenthal - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary", "Analysts", "Doug Leggate - Howard Weil", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "Neil McMahon - Stanford Bernstein", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "Erik Mielke - Merrill Lynch", "Faisal Khan - Citigroup", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Operator", "Thank you for standing by and welcome to the Exxon Mobil Corporation First Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks, I'd like turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, David Rosenthal.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's teleconference and webcast on our first quarter 2009 financial and operating results.", "As you are aware from this morning's press release, ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings performance reflects the strength of our business model during this period of global economic weakness. Crude oil and natural gas prices were well below the levels of a year ago, reducing the absolute level of earnings, however our operating performance was strong and we delivered solid results.", "While we continue to see significant changes in markets and in our industry, ExxonMobil remains committed to investing in our portfolio of advantage project through the business cycle and we remain well positioned for the future as a direct result of our long-term focus, capital discipline, financial strength, and rigorous approach to risk management.", "Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement. Please note that estimates, plans and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Actual results, including resource recoveries, volume growth and project outcomes, could differ materially due to factors I discussed and factors noted in our SEC filing.", "Please see Factors Affecting Future Results and the Form 8-K we furnished this morning, which are available through the Investors section of our website. Please also see the frequently used terms, the supplements to this morning's press release, and the 2008 financial and operating review on our website. This material defines key terms I will use today, shows ExxonMobil's net interest in specific projects and includes our SEC Regulation G disclosure.", "Now, I am pleased to turn your attention to the first quarter results. ExxonMobil's first quarter 2009 earnings and earnings excluding special items were $4.6 billion, a reduction of 6.3 billion from the first quarter of 2008, reflecting a sharp reduction in commodity prices.", "Earnings per share were $0.092, down $1.10 from a year ago.", "During the first quarter 2009, ExxonMobil distributed a total of $9 billion to shareholders, including dividends of $2 billion and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding, of $7 billion, again demonstrating our commitment to return cash to shareholders.", "Reported results and the earning per share calculation are consistent with the new FASB accounting standards adopted by the Corporation in the first quarter of 2009. Please refer to page six in our press release for more information.", "I would now like to share some of the milestones we have achieved since the last earnings call.", "In April, ExxonMobil and our joint venture partners inaugurated the Qatargas II project at Ras Laffan Industrial City, Qatar. This project represents another technological milestone that will make cleaner burning natural gas available to significantly more people across the globe. The project includes two liquefied natural gas trains; Trains 4 and 5, each of which is designed to produce 7.8 million tons per year of LNG, about 50% more than another LNG train currently in service worldwide. Both trains are expected to start up this year.", "In addition to the two LNG trains, the Qatargas II project includes a fleet of the world's largest LNG carriers and the South Hook LNG Terminal in Milford Haven, Wales. The first cargo arrived at the South Hook Terminal in March. The Terminal adds to the UK's LNG import capacity and energy diversity with the ability to deliver up to two billion cubic feet of gas daily into the natural gas grid when full operational capacity is reached.", "The Qatargas II project represents industry's first linkage of natural gas production, liquefaction, shipping and regasification infrastructure, together into a single, fully-integrated LNG development and supply initiative. In total, we expect nine major project startups during 2009; four LNG trains in Qatar, Qatargas II, Trains 4 and 5, and RasGas Trains 6 and 7, South Hook LNG Terminal, the Adriatic LNG Terminal in Porto Levante, Italy, Al Khaleej Gas Phase-2 in Qatar, Piceance Phase-1 in Colorado; and the Tereance (ph) project offshore Norway.", "These major project startups demonstrate our continuing commitment to bring additional oil and gas supplies to market.", "During the quarter, ExxonMobil's U.S. production operations earned the Gas Processors Association's 2009 Company Safety Award. This marks the third time in four years that ExxonMobil's U.S. production organization has earned this award, demonstrating our continuing commitment to industry rating safety performance.", "In exploration, the semi-submersible drilling rig West Aquarius began drilling the Wancong-1 well (ph) in the deepwater Seromano (ph) block offshore Indonesia. The West Aquarius joined the West Polaris as the second of three new state-of-the-art drilling rigs, we will utilize to evaluate our highly perspective deepwater acreage portfolio over the next few years. Wancong-1 is the first of several wells that the West Aquarius will drill offshore Indonesia and the Philippines during the course of this year.", "In Brazil, the West Polaris moved from the Azulao well in the Block BM-S-22 despite the second well in the drilling program, the Gironi (ph) well. The well is currently drilling ahead to target depth.", "During the quarter, we also continued to progress our high potential, unconventional natural gas opportunities around the world.", "In the Horn River Basin in Northeastern British Columbia Canada, and in the lower Saxony basin in Germany, we continue the initial phase of our drilling and evaluation program on our Shale gas acreage.", "In the Mako Trough in southeast Hungary we continue drilling and evaluation operations on several wells in this tight gas play. Testing operations will begin later in 2009.", "Also during the quarter, we were the high bidder for 15 blocks in the recent Gulf of Mexico leased sale.", "Moving now to the downstream. During the quarter, we inaugurated a new, high-efficiency, co-generation plant at our refinery in Antwerp, Belgium.", "Co-generation, is a simultaneous production of electricity and useful heater steam, is significantly more efficient than traditional methods of producing steam and power separately, resulting in lower operating cost and fewer greenhouse gas emissions.", "This high efficiency unit is capable of reducing Belgium's carbon dioxide emissions by an amount equivalent to removing about 90,000 cars from Europe's roads. Also in refining, we continued our activities to reduce raw material cost by managing our crude flexibility. This quarter, ExxonMobil ran 30 crudes that were new to individual refineries.", "In our lubricants business, ExxonMobil introduced the new Mobil DTE 10 Excel series of lubricants. This new family of lubricants is designed to meet the needs of numerous industrial and of highway sectors. These products are another example of our ongoing commitment to help consumers improve the efficiency and productivity of their operations, enabled by our proprietary technology to develop new specialized product formulations.", "Turning now to our chemical business. During the first quarter ExxonMobil announced plans to build a technology center in Shanghai, China, to provide product application support for our growing business throughout Asia. The selection of Shanghai as the site for our new technology center reflects the importance of Asia in the business development and growth plans for our chemical business. The technology center is expected to be operational in 2010 and will support our growing sales of premium products by providing innovative solutions to a wide range of customer needs.", "Now turning to the business line results. Upstream earnings in the first quarter were $3.5 billion, down 5.3 billion from the first quarter of 2008. Upstream after-tax unit earnings in the first quarter of 2009 were $9.32 per barrel.", "Sharply lower crude oil prices and lower natural gas realizations in all regions reduced earnings by about $4.9 billion.", "Worldwide crude oil realizations were down over $52 per barrel and natural gas realizations were down $1.28 per kcf from first quarter 2008.", "Volume and mix affects reduced earnings by $130 million. Other affects decreased earnings by 280 million, due primarily to increased operating expenses, reflecting higher activity level.", "In total, oil equivalent volumes increased slightly from the first quarter of last year. Entitlement volume effects, including price and spend impacts and PSE net interest reductions, increased volumes by 62,000 barrels per day, while OPEC quota effects reduced volumes by 123,000 barrels per day.", "Excluding the impact of entitlement effects, quotas, and divestments, production was up over 2%. Major project ramp-ups in the U.S., West Africa and the North Sea, and lower maintenance activity, more than offset natural field decline.", "Liquids production increased 7,000 barrels per day from the first quarter of last year, excluding the impact of entitlement effects, OPEC quotas and divestments, liquids production was up over a 3%. Major project ramp ups in the U.S., West Africa and the North Sea, and lower maintenance activity more than offset natural field decline.", "Gas volumes decreased 34 million cubic feet per day from the first quarter of 2008, reflecting lower demand in Europe. New project volumes in Qatar, the North Sea and Malaysia, more than offset natural field decline.", "Turning now to the sequential comparison. Versus the fourth quarter of 2008, upstream earnings decreased $2.1 billion, primarily due to lower crude oil and natural gas realizations. Higher crude oil and natural gas volumes increased earnings by $200 million. Other effects reduced earnings by 810 million, as lower gains from asset sales and negative tax of foreign exchange impacts more that offset the benefit of lower expenses.", "Liquids production increased 3,000 barrels per day as new project volume, lower maintenance and positive entitlement effects, more than offset the impact of OPEC quotas and natural field decline.", "Natural gas production was up 3.5%, driven by seasonally higher demand in Europe.", "Oil equivalent volumes were up 1.5% from the fourth quarter of 2008.", "For further data on regional volumes, please refer to the press release and IR supplement.", "Turning now to our downstream results. Downstream earnings in the first quarter were $1.1 billion, down 30 million from the first quarter of 2008.", "Higher margins increased earnings by $720 million, primarily due to stronger refining margins including positive price finalization effects.", "Marketing margins were also higher. Volume and mix effects reduced earnings by $370 million, driven primarily by a lower global demand.", "Other effects were negative 380 million, including adverse foreign exchange impacts and higher activity-driven operating expenses.", "Sequentially, first quarter downstream earnings decreased by $1.3 billion. Lower margins reduced earnings by 700 million, driven by lower marketing and refining margins, including adverse price finalization effects, partly offset by the absence of negative inventory change impacts.", "Volume and mix affects decreased earnings by $50 million.", "Other factors reduced earnings by $530 million, driven by lower asset sales and the absence of positive LIFO effects.", "Turning now to our chemical earnings. First quarter chemical earnings were $350 million, down $680 million from the first quarter of 2008. Weaker margins reduced earnings by $270 million reflecting lower realizations, while volume effects were negative 290 million, primarily due to lower demand.", "Other effects reduced earnings by $120 million, including negative foreign exchange impacts and hurricane related repair costs.", "Sequentially, first quarter chemical earnings increased by $200 million. Weaker margins reduced earnings by 70 million while positive volume and mix effect increased earning by $130 million.", "Other effects were positive 130 million, with lower hurricane related impacts and reduced operating expenses, partially offset by the absence of positive LIFO effects.", "Turning now to our corporate and financing segment. Consistent with our expectations, corporate and financing expenses increased by $347 million versus first quarter 2008, primarily due to lower interest income, reflecting both a reduced cash balance and lower interest rates. These results also included the impact of positive tax effects. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2008, corporate and financing expenses increased by $53 million.", "As we look forward, we currently expect corporate and financing charges in 2009 to be in the region of 500 to $700 million per quarter.", "Effective tax rate for the first quarter was 45%.", "At the end of the first quarter our cash balance was $25 billion and debt was $9 billion.", "The corporation distributed $9 billion to shareholders in the first quarter, through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $7 billion was distributed to purchase shares in excess of dilution, reducing the number of shares outstanding by almost 2%. Share purchases to reduced shares outstanding are expected to be $5 billion in the second quarter of 2009.", "Yesterday our Board announced an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.42 per share.", "ExxonMobil has paid a dividend each year for more than a century and has increased its annual dividend payment for 27 consecutive years.", "CapEx in the first quarter was $5.8 billion, an increase of 5% from first quarter 2008 and in line with our previous guidance. We continue to invest in robust projects through the business cycle to help meet global demand for crude oil, natural gas and finished products.", "In summary, these results reflect the strength of ExxonMobil's business model. We remain confident that our long-term perspective, financial strength and disciplined investment approach, will continue to deliver superior, differentiated results and positions us well for the future.", "That concludes my prepared remarks. I would now be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Rosenthal. (Operators Instructions). Our first question will come from Doug Leggate with Howard Weil.", "Doug Leggate - Howard Weil", "Hear me okay?", "Operator", "Yeah, we can hear you fine.", "Doug Leggate - Howard Weil", "Great. I've got a couple of questions. The first one; I think you kind of addressed it with your corporate guidance there. As far as the interest income last year was concerned, given that the cash balance in now declining; can you quantify that? I mean you're now assuming basically no interest income on underlying corporate expense going forward?", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning, Doug. With regard to our interest income, it was down significantly from the first quarter of last year and again, that was due both to the smaller cash balance as well as the interest rates available in the market. We did have of course some income this quarter, but again our focus with regard to cash balance (ph) has been and continues to be preservation of our balance.", "Doug Leggate - Howard Weil", "Okay. Hopefully that doesn't qualify as perfect question, but the related question I guess is, when you look at your $25 billion cash balance, it's now down 15 billion from a year ago, where do you see that going? I mean, in terms of, in terms -- how you manage it, how aggressive will you be with share buybacks given the little commodity because a $5 billion clip per quarter, you start basically will write through that pretty quickly here. Can you just conceptualize how you think about that please?", "David Rosenthal", "Well, Doug first of all we are not really prepared to provide any guidance beyond the second quarter, where as I mentioned a (inaudible) we do expect to spend $5 billion on share repurchases. As we've said before, share purchases is the flywheel (ph) with our cash. Our first objective with our cash is to fund our very robust investment program and we are continuing to do that through the first quarter this year and onward.", "The second thing we've always said we do with our cash is pay the dividend and as I mentioned a little bit ago we are please to announce that yesterday our Board did increase the dividend by $0.02 a share a quarter", "After funding the investment plan and the dividend, you do take a look then at the share repurchases but again on the guidance for second quarter (inaudible) is to offer any more guidance, but of course we'll adjust the rate of purchases as appropriate as we manage our cash balances while maintaining flexibility to implement any future plans that we may have.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Michael LaMotte with J.P. Morgan.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "Thank you. David I apologize if you went over this at the beginning of the call because I did get on a little bit late, but could you provide an update on the status of Qatargas II Train 4 and when that could be expected to be fully up and running?", "David Rosenthal", "Michael, I'd be happy to talk about Qatargas Train -- II Train 4. Our progress and commissioning is proceeding well. We did start up the train in March and we actually produced our first LNG and loaded a cargo. Since that time, Qatargas has brought Train 4 down to correct some issues identified during our rigorous commissioning and our start up process. As you know, these are very large trains.", "This is the first of four and we have a very rigorous disciplined approach to commissioning and start up and we are pleased with how that is going. And obviously, any lessons learnt from this start-up will be applied to the trains. But we do expect LNG production will again commence in the near-term. But all in, we're very pleased. We feel very good about how that startup went. It's a lot of equipment and we're very pleased with how things are going so far.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "Any specifics on timing?", "David Rosenthal", "I wouldn't want to give any specifics other than to say the work is progressing very well.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "Okay.", "David Rosenthal", "On a couple of issues that we're resolving and we would expect that to start up in the near-term.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Perhaps -- it's my related follow up. Perhaps you could just remind us of sort of ExxonMobil's philosophy on liquefaction, capacity utilization, particularly as it pertains to demand and pricing in the end markets?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure Mike, I'll be happy to talk about that. As we've mentioned before, one of the things that makes our investments in the LNG business in Qatar unique in the industry, is we have a fully integrated value chain from the gas, from the north field through liquefaction, the largest LNG trains ever built and the largest ships ever built to transport the LNG, as well as our terminals that we have located in major, in major margin.", "This gives us really an advantage project, at the lowest LNG cost. It is competitive. In all of the markets that we serve, our intention is to start these trains up safely and successfully, and run them and make that gas available to markets worldwide.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "Any reason that wouldn't run at 90%, 95% with...", "David Rosenthal", "There is no reason that we won't run those trains to their full capacity after again a safe and successful start-up.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "Right. Thank you, David.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Neil McMahon with Stanford Bernstein.", "Neil McMahon - Stanford Bernstein", "Hi. A few questions again. Maybe just still back on Qatargas II Train 4. Could you go into what the start-up problems were and obviously on something which is brand new from the scale of this project, there are going to be some issues to begin with. So, I am wondering if that will delay, as you said with the lessons learnt the other projects coming up this year?", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah, let me just first reiterate. We had a very successful commissioning process and start up. All of the equipment worked as we had expected. Again, these are very large, very complex trains. And again, we are very pleased with how things started up. We did produce the Cargo. And then Qatargas took the train down again for some maintenance. I really don't have a lot of details on what the items were. They were a few different things. But again our focus is on the long-term nature of this project and getting the first train here, Train 4, up and running again. But we do not foresee any issues with our plans to start up the next three trains.", "Neil McMahon - Stanford Bernstein", "Okay. Maybe just looking at the situation in the chemical market, what was your chemical plant utilization in the quarter? It looks like, as expected I suppose pretty weak demand for chemicals and so maybe if you could mention the utilization and roughly your outlook in the near-term for chemicals globally?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, rather than talking terms of plant utilization rates, I think what we aught to focus on is the general demand situation. We did see weak demand across our geographic sectors as well as across our products, some to different degrees than others, but general weak demand all around. As we've said for a long time, this is a very cyclical business. We are certainly experiencing one of the downturns in that cycle. But we are maintaining a very long term focus continuing on with our investment program and looking forward to being well positioned when the market turns around.", "I can tell you where we're sitting today. We really don't have any outlook on changes in demand going forward. It's probably a little early to tell. Again, it's a very large diversified business. And generally speaking, consistent with the global economy demand is weak and we can't predict how long that will take, but again, we are very pleased with our portfolio both the manufacturing facilities as well as the product mix that we have to offer.", "And we're managing this business through the downturn as we have in the past and we're very pleased with our position in the industry when this thing turns around.", "Neil McMahon - Stanford Bernstein", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mark Flannery of Credit Suisse.", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Hey good morning. I wonder if you could comment in general terms on costs. I know earlier in the call you mentioned that operating costs were a little higher year-over-year in the upstream, and described these as activity based. We've heard from other big oil companies that costs are falling in the upstream on a unit basis. Could you may be give us some color on what you are seeing in your portfolio?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, I'd believe happy to comment on OpEx. Obviously, this is a very important topic in our industry given where we are in the current economic climate. But let me step back just a second and talk broadly about cost management in ExxonMobil because it does transcend all of our business units, and then I will give you a couple of specifics.", "As you know, keeping a relentless focus on cost management has been a hallmark of ExxonMobil for a very long time and throughout our business cycle. We don't wait for downturns in the market to get to work efficiencies, in cost savings. We learned a long time ago that if you don't let your check book get out of control in the good times, you don't have to slam on the breaks and disrupt the organization when the market turns down a little bit.", "We feel very good about our ability to maintain our cost leadership, given our size and scale and global reach, and all of that combined with our single global procurement and contracting organization. We are confident that we're getting the lowest prices for goods and services that the market has to offer but nonetheless as you'll see in our detailed first quarter filings, our costs in total are down significantly versus the first quarter 2008. In fact, our total expenses are down about 10 % or just under $2 billion before tax quarter-over-quarter.", "Now of course lower energy costs are a big piece of that as are some favorable foreign exchange effects, the dollar has strengthened against some of the other major currencies. But I will note that we also delivered several hundred million dollars of savings as a result of both operating efficiencies and divestments. And I will also add on an ongoing basis, we are seeing some decline in vendor rates and material prices flowing through to our operating expenses.", "So once again, I'd like to say that if you look at our business over a long-term, we maintain that focus on cost management and that allows us to grow the business and invest through the business cycle and execute our plans for the business.", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Great. May be I -- my second question would be related to that, which is; let's assume for the sake of arguments that vendor pricing and capital costs continue to fall through 2009, do you think there is a change for you to understand your capital budget this year and its leads to same results?", "David Rosenthal", "That's an excellent question. As you recall at our Analysts Meeting in March, we did table a figure of about $29 billion in CapEx. We set up the time that that was our best estimate, given everything we knew that was going on. Obviously, there are puts and takes in that. Some of our partners have announced a need to perhaps adjust to our investment plans and that might flow through a little bit, but where we are sitting today, that it still, still looks like a pretty good, a pretty good estimate.", "I would like to comment though just on that $29 billion, that's not a target, Okay. It's not a minimum. We'd be happy if cost come down due to our rigorous efforts and cost management to spend less to achieve the same level of project activity. But I also need to turn the coin over and say that that $29 billion figure is also not a cap and as the year progresses, if new opportunities that weren't originally in our plan present themselves, we're fortunate to have the financial flexibility and the organizational capability to take those, take those projects on if we see them and they come along.", "So, in summary I'd say we feel pretty good about that 29 billion from where we are today. It's a very large business and a lot of factors go into that. But it's pretty early in the year, and we're very pleased primarily with the progress of our projects and how our plans are proceeding and CapEx looks pretty good for the year.", "Mark Flannery - Credit Suisse", "Right, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mark Gilman with The Benchmark Company.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "David, good morning.", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning, Mark. How are you this morning?", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "Good thanks. David with Michael's questions I just want to go back to previously raised subject, because I guess, my understanding just isn't clear. With respect to the cost issue, I listened very carefully to what you say. However, that seems to be contradicted by what you had to say with respect to segment earnings variances. If overall costs are down by anywhere near the amount that you suggested, I frankly don't quite understand how in your discussion of the upstream and downstream segments, higher operating expenses would have been considered a factor?", "The other thing is the corporate guidance. There must be something else that is occurring in order to take that number to five to $700 million per quarter after tax. It seems to me if would eliminate the full amount of any interest income in 2008, based upon our 30 odd billion cash position, you would not get corporate charges or an increase in corporate charges in the magnitude that's being suggested. So I would appreciate some additional clarification as to what's driving that? Thanks.", "David Rosenthal", "I'd be happy to answer both of those. Let me start up off with our earnings factor analysis just to be clear. One of the things I have mentioned in that 10% reduction in overall cost as booked, of course is the impact of lower energy prices. They have a major impact. And of course those show up in our waterfall charts in the margin column. The other factor that's in there is the favorable foreign exchange that helps on the OpEx, but as you know foreign exchange on the other side hurts on the translation of local European currency revenues and if you net both of those off, its not a big factor and we put that in the other category.", "The efficiencies and impacts of divestments that I mentioned, again we had several hundred million dollars in underlying efficiencies, but those were offset by new business growth and opportunities that were progressing and activities that we have underway in various businesses. So, we're very pleased as I mentioned with how our OpEx is coming along this year and how we're responding to the business.", "Let me hit the corporate guidance for just a second on Corp and FIN (ph). A number of factors as you know, are in the Corp and FIN. The interest income piece is a big piece of that. As we've talked over the years, tax effects come and go and can vary quite significantly as we go along. As we look in total, at this year versus last year and what's going on in Corp and FIN, we also have some increased pension expense that flows through there. But again, it's not material.", "So it's a number of factors. But overall, wanted to just let you know that about 500, I thought it would be helpful if we had guidance around 500 to $700 million for each quarter -- for the balance of the year, but again I need to stress that'll move around as things come and go.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "Thanks David.", "David Rosenthal", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "Hey guys.", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning, Paul. How you're doing?", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "Good morning. Very good. Dave, on the $29 billion of the CapEx for this year -- sorry to ask that question again. What is the percentage of that amount that's currently not tied to already signed fixed contracts? In other words Dave, what is the percentage that maybe subject to the dependent on the fall in the spot price?", "David Rosenthal", "Paul, that's an excellent question. I don't have -- I don't have the numbers in that kind of detail, but as you know, depending on where you are in the project cycle, projects that are finishing up, the CapEx for those won't be impacted in all by the changes in prices and rates. Projects that are in the beginning or middle stages that might have had long lead time equipment purchases a year or two ago, those aren't impacted.", "And then you move on into the balance of the projects particularly those that are just getting underway. That's where we have a focus really on our ability to roll our cost. So, if you look at the projects that are underway or well along, obviously the focus there is on executing those projects and successfully starting them up. As we look into the projects that are under development and start and we're just getting construction underway, we are of course working those very hard particularly, on some of our large projects that we're just now getting underway.", "So, I'd say all in again, we think that $29 billion number, given where we are today, looks pretty good. But less assured any opportunity we have that we work this hard everyday to bring those costs down, we are more than happy to do so and coming under that, but again we are also on the lookout for new opportunities...", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "Great, totally understand that. If you don't have that number, is that something that you guys may believe willing to share and may be me or someone else from your team after the call may be able to give me a call and just shed some light for me.", "David Rosenthal", "Paul, I really don't think we even have that detail and if we did, we really probably wouldn't -- we typically just wouldn't disclose that. But we will give you a call and see if we can help you out a little bit on that.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "Okay. If I could have a second question?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "With the Obama Administration there have been long launch release of they trying to keep (ph) on the oil industry. I am sure that you guys probably already looked at that. Have you had any rough estimate that all those proposals are indeed being impact (ph) and what is the total hit on you guys?", "David Rosenthal", "That's -- it is way early to talk about what impacts might be from legislation that might be passed. Obviously, there are a lot of ideas out there and a lot of discussion going on", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "Paul can we ask that if you don't have -- willing to share a number, is there any particular one proposal that may hi Exxon more than the other proposals that based on what you guys can currently identify?", "David Rosenthal", "No Paul, I'd say there really isn't any one proposal, what I would offer though is we want to be a part of the debate. We are looking forward to discussing the issues of energy supply with the Administration and again being an active part of that debate. There is a lot to discuss on very important issues, but we are really not prepared at this point to speculate on what might come about and what any impact might be on ExxonMobil.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "Can I just may be in a really quick question one more?", "David Rosenthal", "Okay", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "I think you asked about the cash or that the dividend policy, just trying to understand I mean if I look at it in the first quarter, your cash burn rate is roughly about nearly over $6 billion and your dividend is your capital spend, and your capital spending based on the 29 billion is going to be increased by about two billion from the first quarter level for the remaining of the year.", "And let's assume you understand the opinion on that, so you reduced your share buyback program from the first or second quarter by two billion. So that would suggest that you're still burning roughly about six billion of the cash and wondering that I mean how should we look at, do you think that you feel comfortable of the burn rate or that overtime you want to manage it to a substantially lower burn rate?", "David Rosenthal", "Paul I really don't have any guidance to give overall on burn rates or share buyback other than what I've mentioned, which is, we are intending to or planning to spend $5 billion on share backs in the second quarter. But again, if you look at our cash balance and the strength of our balance sheet, we have the flexibility to find a very robust investment plan, pay the growing dividend that was announced yesterday, take advantage of any opportunity that might come along, and then after all of that, we'll take a look at the cash balances and look at the share repurchase program.", "But gain. I think the important thing is to -- that distinguishes ExxonMobil in this regard is the strength of our balanced sheet, our AAA credit rating, our very strong cash flow, low level of debt, just leave us well positioned to take advantage of opportunities as they come along. And of course the other things that effects a cash burn rate over long period of time is our disciplined approach to investing and we remain very pleased with the decisions we've made over the last few years and how the business looks going forward.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "Okay, thank you", "Operator", "Our next question is from Erik Mielke with Merrill Lynch.", "Erik Mielke - Merrill Lynch", "Good morning, David.", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning, Erik", "Erik Mielke - Merrill Lynch", "My first question relates to your production outlook for 2009 and just try to fix out that where we are right now compared to where we were two months ago, when you gave your guidance of, let's called it, modest growth for 2009. The things that have changed since then I guess will be more information on where OPEC quotas are taking you and then also what's happening in Qatar? And I was little bit surprised by some of your European gas sales. My question is; are you still comfortable with that guidance or do we need to think about it just in adjustments to that guidance for OPEC quotas or perhaps a Qatar as well?", "David Rosenthal", "Thanks. That's a good question. I'm happy the happy to talk about that. It has been less then two months since our meeting were we did talk about a production outlook of about four million barrels per day. As we mentioned at the time, there are a lot of puts and takes around that and a lot of things that can sway that. But where we're sitting today, we still think that's a pretty good outlook. Again in the context of our very long-term approach to investing, I'll tell you the projects that we have on the table that we're progressing are all progressing well and we're very pleased with that.", "And of course, the production in any quarter, any given year will be a function of how those projects come online. But you mentioned OPEC quotas, the gas trains as I mentioned are coming on as planned over the course of the year, and all in we're looking at, we would still expect to come in around that four million barrel a day mark. And more importantly, as we look out over the next several years, meet those -- meet the target, and meet the outlook that we showed you in the Analyst Meeting.", "Erik Mielke - Merrill Lynch", "That's great, thanks. My follow up question relates to Sakhalin-1 where the trade presses talked about progress that you've made in your negotiations with the Russian Government on domestic gas. Can you give us an update on that project please and what are the key milestones you look forward to?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, I'll be happy too. First of all, if you look at the Sakhalin project, today we've been very pleased with how that project has come along. We're very pleased with the production and performance of that project and its performing well. As we look into to 2009 and beyond, as you read in the press, we did have a delay getting the budgets approved for some of the projects and the work plan for this year. We successfully worked through that with the local officials and those work plans and budgets are approved and we continue to progress the development of the Adap-2 (ph) project. And we're also working on the activities for the (inaudible) development. So, that whole project is underway and working well", "As opposed to the gas supply, we can confirm that the Sakhalin-1 consortium is prepared to supply an additional 1.5 Bcm a year of gas to the Russian domestic market and we continue to evaluate all the viable options and work with the appropriate government authorities to work through that.", "But again, there is a lot going on, a lot of things we are working on but I think the most important thing to keep in mind is so far that project has met our expectations, met the governments expectations and delivered well, and we feel very good about how we are moving forward and progressing our plans for the balance of that project.", "Erik Mielke - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you", "Operator", "Our next question is from Faisal Khan with Citigroup.", "Faisal Khan - Citigroup", "Good morning.", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning, Faisal. How are you?", "Faisal Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. How are you doing?", "David Rosenthal", "I am fine, thank you.", "Faisal Khan - Citigroup", "All right. I just want to confirm the production you guys reported in Asia, Asia-Pac and Middle East that was down sequentially quarter-over-quarter, is that -- I take it that OPEC, OPEC production cuts?", "David Rosenthal", "That would certainly be a big piece if that in the Middle East. We do produce a lot of volumes out of there and yeah that would be a major factor there.", "Faisal Khan - Citigroup", "Okay, and I just want to confirm, in your prepared remarks I think you said that you had started up the production in the Piceance Basin, is that correct?", "David Rosenthal", "We are progressing phase-1 in the Piceance Basin and that project is progressing well. As we've said in the past, that is a very large resource and it gives me the -- gives us the opportunity to really apply some of our technology. And yes, we did get the startup in the second quarter and we would -- and as we move on we're continuing to progress that project.", "Faisal Khan - Citigroup", "And there is no reason to think that it would slowdown the pace of that production profile?", "David Rosenthal", "The good thing about the Piceance project is we're developing that in phases. We're taking a very long-term approach to a very large resource. We do have the flexibility around pace, but I can tell you where we're at today. We're progressing in phase-I of that project per the plan.", "Faisal Khan - Citigroup", "Okay. One last question.", "David Rosenthal", "Sure.", "Faisal Khan - Citigroup", "Your petroleum products sales in Europe fell off pretty precipitously from fourth quarter to first quarter '09. I was wondering if you could just give a little color around that. What do you guys going on in Europe? Do you see further declines given the economy or are you seeing stabilization there?", "David Rosenthal", "Well first of all as you noted, those volumes are down considerably and really it just reflects underlying changes in demand. And as we look across the quarter, as we sit here today, it's just too soon to tell anything about the future going forward. We'll have to see how the general economy progresses going forward. But it's just too early to tell and there is really no data out there that gives us the ability to make any predictions or draw any conclusions about what the near-term demand might be.", "Faisal Khan - Citigroup", "Okay, great. I appreciate the time. Thank you.", "David Rosenthal", "Sure.", "Operator", "Next question is from Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Hi David.", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning Paul, how are you?", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay. Thanks. The -- I just have follow ups really David. The first one really goes way back to the first question I think, regarding you cash balance. Is it fair to say that you don't want to hold cash on your balance sheet? Essentially you would be looking overtime to work your cash balance towards there?", "David Rosenthal", "What I would say is there is no change to our cash management approach. If you look a long time over history, we have not typically carried the large cash balances. But again, I think Paul you have to stand back and look at what our overall objectives are in this regard. And one of the foremost one is to maintain our AAA credit rating and the strength of our balance sheet and maintain our ability to invest in our opportunities that we have in front of us and pay our dividend. And as I said before, once we do that we'll evaluate our cash position and look at our share buyback.", "But I think the important thing really is the approach to risk management that we've had with our cash over the last year too and the wise use of that cash going forward.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "But you would still say that holding cash is low return, right?", "David Rosenthal", "I would say over the long-term again historically, we don't tend to hold large cash balances. But as you know this is a cyclical business and cash flows do tend to move up and down with the general industry conditions. And then we'll use that cash as we move along and keep our balance sheet strong. And again, as we said before, maintain the capital discipline and not do anything dumb with the money.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay. I think I -- I just move on to my own questions and come back with a follow up on CapEx, but if I could just on Europe, you mentioned projects start up in the North Sea, you mentioned weather, but at the same time it seems to me that your volumes in Europe and oil are down 10% and your natural gas volume's down 3%. Can you specify what the project startups were and how big they were? I guess what I am trying to infer is the underlying decline rates, there must believe pretty aggressive?", "David Rosenthal", "Let's step back and look at what happened in sales overall from first quarter last year to first quarter this year. We did see demand drop down as we mentioned and as you've noted and we don't think that was weather related. If you look at the degree days and that sort of thing, I think the winter was at least as cold if not a little cooler than last year.", "So that would imply some drop in underlying industry demand. And I think that's kind of the story there. As we look quarter-to-quarter, we didn't have any real major project impacts on the gas side. We do have the continuing effects from the projects of last year particularly Volvo and University (ph) but all of those effects again it's really a demand story. Our projects are doing well again, Volvo and Starling last year and I think he asked the question this year will be starting up the Tereance (ph) project in the North Sea.", "So, other than demand I would say that things are going just about as we would expect on European Gas.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "I mean it was colder right and there was problem with gas supply from Russia; it would imply that your volumes were up?", "David Rosenthal", "Well, but I think you'll have to look at what the underlying industrial demand was in Europe.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay.", "David Rosenthal", "And it's probably the primary factor for the overall decline.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Yeah, I understand. Okay.", "David Rosenthal", "There's a lot of capacity issue.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay. Great. Thanks. And then product sales are down 5.6% I think is the number that is to say your oil product sales you kind of referenced it a little bit in terms of the Europe in the previous question but is there anything little funky in there in terms of deposals or is that just a pure economic downturn and that would demand downturn? And as a follow up to that same question, gasoline demand, you have down 8% I think year-over-year and just up 4.7% which is totally the opposite of the industry trend that we are seeing, for example in the U.S. weekly data, could you talk a little about that? Thanks.", "David Rosenthal", "Sure, let me start out with your first question as we look at the decline in product sales. We did have we did see lower sales due to demand of course consistent with the general economic conditions, but we did have some lower sales due to divestments from the prior year. So, it was the combination of both of those.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "That's about 50-50, that demand?", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah, in order of magnitude, that's probably about right.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Right. And then (inaudible)", "David Rosenthal", "Excuse me?", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "The gasoline versus distillate?", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah if we look at gasoline versus distillates, if you're looking in the U.S., we did see quarter-on-quarter versus last year mo-gas was down and diesel was up I don't think any of really any of what we're seeing in this is vastly different than what we're seeing in the industry.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Well the U.S. gasoline demand is down slightly and distillates down like 10%, so for you to be down 8% in gasoline and up in distillate, is roughly different?", "David Rosenthal", "We certainly could be seeing some, some mix effects in there Paul but I don't think there is anything significant or major in that difference.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "What do you ...", "David Rosenthal", "That I can point to.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "What do you mean by mix effects?", "David Rosenthal", "Just say what we're selling and how we're running our refineries", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay.", "David Rosenthal", "And optimizing crude slates and the products we're offering into the market. But again I can't point to anything significant or an individual item that would make us different from the rest of industry.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay and finally from me, David on CapEx again. The run rate for Q1 is way behind the 29 billion that you're talking about. Are you saying that we should -- and I guess you are saying quite frankly that we should expect to ramp up to that kind of pace to meet the 29 billion for the rest of year?", "David Rosenthal", "That's a good question, we typically -- it's really a timing issue. Typically if you look historically, first quarter capital expenditures are lower than they tend to be over the rest of the year.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Yes.", "David Rosenthal", "What I would say is, CapEx is coming in about what we expected", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Right.", "David Rosenthal", "And we're still on track.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Yeah, I've got it. Thanks David.", "David Rosenthal", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And with that, that does conclude the question and answer session. I would like turn the call to David Rosenthal for any additional or closing comment.", "David Rosenthal", "Thank you very much. All I would like to say here in closing is we had a very good quarter operationally. Our plans are progressing as we expected. And to conclude, I'd just like to thank everybody for their time and joining us and the excellent questions that you asked.", "So again, thanks you very much for participating in the conference call today.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks I\u2019d like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Good morning and welcome to Exxon Mobil\u2019s teleconference and webcast on our fourth quarter and full year 2009 financial and operating results. As you are aware from this morning\u2019s press release, Exxon Mobil\u2019s fourth quarter earnings performance was strong. Our results reflect the soundness of our business model during a period of global economic weakness and significant volatility in commodity prices. ", "Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement. Please note that estimates, plans and expectations are forward-looking statements. Actual results, including resource recovery, volume growth and project outcomes could differ materially due to factors I discuss and factors noted in our SEC filings. Please see Factors Affecting Future Results and the Form 8-K we furnished this morning, which are available through the Investors Section of our website. Please also see the frequently used terms, the supplements to this morning\u2019s press release and the 2008 financial and operating review on our website. This material defines key terms I will use today, shows Exxon Mobil\u2019s net interest in specific projects and includes our SEC Regulation G disclosure. ", "Now I am pleased to turn your attention to the fourth quarter results. Exxon Mobil\u2019s fourth quarter 2009 earnings were $6.1 billion, a reduction of $1.8 billion from the fourth quarter of 2008, mainly reflecting the challenging environment in the downstream. Compared to the third quarter of 2009, earnings were up $1.3 billion. Earnings per share were $1.27, down $0.27 from a year ago. During the fourth quarter of 2009, Exxon Mobil distributed a total of $4 billion to shareholders, including dividends of $2 billion and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding of $2 billion. ", "Exxon Mobil\u2019s full year 2009 earnings were $19.3 billion, down $25.9 billion from 2008, reflecting the weak economy, resulting in lower commodity prices, weaker margins and lower demand. Full year 2009 earnings included a charge of $140 million for interest related to the Valdez litigation. Full year 2008 earnings included a gain of $1.6 billion on the sale of our German gas transportation business and a charge of $460 million related to the Valdez litigation. Earnings, excluding special items, were $19.4 billion, down $24.6 billion from 2008. ", "As you are aware, on December 14, 2009, Exxon Mobil and XTO Energy announced an agreement, bringing together two organizations with highly complementary skills and capabilities. XTO has assembled a substantial, high quality, unconventional natural gas and oil resource base in the U.S. They also have extensive technical capabilities and operating experience in unconventional resources. These qualities, combined with Exxon Mobil\u2019s global, unconventional gas portfolio, world class research and technology capabilities, industry leading project management and operational skills, and financial capacity will create a premier, global, unconventional resource organization. We expect to file the joint S-4 registration statement and proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission shortly. Additionally, we anticipate submitting the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act filing to the Federal Trade Commission by mid-February.", "Turning now to our business line results and some of the milestones we achieved since the last earning call, first in the Upstream. During the quarter, the second phase of the Al Khaleej Gas project started up in Qatar. AKG Phase 2 has the capacity to supply 1.25 billion cubic feet of gas per day to meet Qatar\u2019s growing domestic demand. Combined with Phase One, which has been operating since 2005, AKG Phase 2 has increased the project\u2019s total gas supply capacity to 2 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day. Including AKG Phase 2, Qatar Gas 2, Trains 4 and 5 and Ras Gas Train 6 in Qatar, the South Hook LNG receiving terminal in the UK, the Adriatic LNG terminal in Italy, Piceance Phase 1 in the U.S. and Spherion\u2019s in Norway, Exxon Mobil completed eight major project start-ups in 2009. These projects are forecast to provide a combined net production of nearly 400,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in 2010.", "The final Qatar LNG Train, Ras Gas Train 7, is completing commissioning. Gas is now flowing into the facility and we anticipate first LNG in the coming weeks. This will be the fourth 7.8 million tons per year train brought online by our joint ventures with Qatar Petroleum. Including this train, we will participate in approximately 62 million tons per year of LNG capacity in Qatar. ", "In December, Exxon Mobil and our co-venture partners agreed to proceed with the Papua New Guinea LNG project. The project is an integrated development that includes gas production and processing facilities, onshore and offshore pipelines and liquefaction facilities with the capacity to produce 6.6 million tons of LNG per year. To date the project participants have executed sales and purchase agreements for 5.3 million tons per year of LNG with Sinopec, Tokyo Electric Power Company and Osaka Gas Company. The remaining sales and financing activities are well progressed and the project remains on track to complete these agreements in the first quarter of 2010. Major contracts associated with the development of the project have been awarded and project execution activity has commenced.", "In Russia, we completed the first two extended-reach wells at our Sakhalin 1, Odoptu Project, using one of the world\u2019s most powerful land based rigs. In addition, the Sakhalin 1 Project\u2019s De-Kastri Oil Export Terminal received the Terminal of the Year Award at an annual industry conference hosted in Russia. The aware recognizes the most outstanding international terminal with a capacity of over 5 million tons annually.", "Also during the quarter, Exxon Mobil drilled the longest well in North America at our Santa Ynez unit offshore California. This complex well measured over 37,000 feet in total length and set a new world record for horizontal reach for an offshore well.", "In December, Exxon Mobil resumed drilling our two development wells at Point Thomson in Alaska. We expect to complete these wells later this year.", "Moving to Exploration, we completed a new wildcat well targeting additional potential near our deepwater Hadrian discovery in the Gulf of Mexico. The well encountered oil and gas in several sub-salt reservoirs. Operations continue on a successful sidetrack, drilled into an adjacent fault block. ", "In the Asia Pacific region, the West Aquarius rig completed the [Dhabi Quan] One well offshore of the Philippines, our first wildcat in the SC 56 block. The well encountered gas and multiple reservoirs. We are evaluating this discovery and have now commenced operations on a second wildcat well on the block. We also participated in three natural gas discoveries on Australia\u2019s Northwest Shelf. ", "During the fourth quarter we worked with the Iraq Ministry of Oil to finalize the agreement to redevelop and expand the West Qurna-1 field. Last week we signed this agreement and we look forward to working with the government of Iraq and the South Oil Company in progressing this significant new opportunity.", "Turning to our unconventional gas opportunities, during 2009 Exxon Mobil increased its position in the Marcellus Shale gas play through a formation of a 50-50 joint venture with Pennsylvania General Energy. The joint venture holds approximately 290,000 gross acres in the play and we are encouraged by the drilling results and production rates achieved so far. Including this capture, our total global, unconventional gas acreage now stands at over 5.5 million net acres.", "In the Horn River Basin in Canada, we ramped up our activity during the fourth quarter. We currently have four rigs, conducting an extensive evaluation program of our industry leading acreage position in this shale gas play. We plan to conduct a number of well tests over the next few months.", "Also in Canada, Exxon Mobil acquired 16.5 thousand net acres of high quality, oil sands resource in the Firebag area of Athabasca. This new acreage is adjacent to several of our existing leases and is close to the coral development area.", "Turning now to the Upstream operating results, Upstream earnings in the fourth quarter were $5.8 billion, up $150 million from the fourth quarter of 2008. Upstream, after tax earnings per barrel, were $15 in the fourth quarter of 2009. Higher crude oil prices, partly offset by lower natural gas realizations in all regions, increased earnings by $660 million. Worldwide liquids realizations were up over $21 per barrel in the quarter, while natural gas realizations were down $3.46 per kcf from the fourth quarter of 2008. Higher volumes increased earnings by $250 million. Other effects reduced earnings by $760 million, due primarily to lower gains from asset sales and increased exploration expense.", "Fourth quarter 2009 oil equivalent volumes increased about 2% from the fourth quarter of last year, driven by major project ramp ups. Entitlement volume effects including price and spend impacts, NPSC interest reductions, reduced volumes by 26,000 barrels per day. Excluding the impact of lower entitlement volumes, quotas and divestments, production was up over 3%. Project ramp ups in Qatar, [inaudible] and the U.S. more than offset natural field declines. Liquids production decreased 79,000 barrels per day or 3% from the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding impacts related to lower entitlement volumes, quotas and divestments, production was essentially flat.", "Project ramp ups in Qatar, Kazakhstan and the U.S. offset natural field decline. Gas volumes increased 868 million cubic feet per day or nearly 9% from the fourth quarter of 2008, driven by new project volumes in Qatar, partially offset by natural field decline.", "Turning now to the sequential comparison, versus the third quarter of 2009, Upstream earnings increased $1.8 billion due primarily to higher realizations and increased volumes. Liquids and natural gas realizations increased earnings by $840 million. Higher crude oil and natural gas volumes increased earnings by $550 million. Other items benefited earnings by an additional $380 million. ", "Liquids production increased 2.5%, mainly reflecting the impact of new project volumes. Natural gas production was up over 31%, driven by seasonally higher demand in Europe and new project volumes in Qatar. In total, oil equivalent volumes were up almost 13% from the third quarter.", "Looking now at the full year results, 2009 Upstream earnings excluding special items were $17.1 billion, down $16.7 billion from 2008. Lower realizations decreased earnings by $15.2 billion. Crude oil prices were down over $34 per barrel and natural gas realizations decreased $3.53 per kcf, reflecting lower prices in all major producing regions. Volume mix effects increased earnings by $700 million. Other factors reduced factors by $2.2 billion, largely due to higher expenses, including the impact of new project start ups and increased exploration activities and lower gains on asset sales.", "Full year equivalent volumes were up slightly from 2008. Liquids volumes were down less than 1%, while natural gas volumes were up 2%. Excluding entitlement volume effects, quotas and divestments, total production was up 1.6%. New project volumes in Qatar, the U.S., West Africa and Kazakhstan more than offset natural field decline.", "Moving now to the Downstream, the Fujian Integrated Refining and Chemical Complex achieved full operation during the fourth quarter. This joint venture project is the first integrated refining and petrochemical facility in China with foreign participation. More than $4.5 billion was invested in the complex, which tripled the distillation capacity of the existing refinery. The Complex also features a state-of-the-art cogeneration facility, which will meet the majority of the site\u2019s power demands. The integration of refining, chemical and fuels marketing operations provides synergies that will help maximize operating flexibility and capture associated cost savings. ", "In our Lubricants business, Exxon Mobil and Toyota Racing Development announced a new technological partnership in which Exxon Mobil will provide Mobil One racing oil technology and products to Toyota racing supported NASCAR teams starting in the 2010 season. We also received the Thomas A. Edison Patent Award for development of Mobil One Emission Systems Protection Oil, further demonstrating our lubricant technology leadership. Mobil One ESP was specially formulated to enable reduced emissions from diesel passenger cars.", "Finally, in refining we continued our activities to optimize refinery operations by expanding our crude flexibility. This quarter Exxon Mobil ran 21 crudes that were new to individual refineries. ", "Turning now to the Downstream operating results, Downstream earnings in the fourth quarter were a loss of $189 million, down $2.6 billion from the fourth quarter of 2008. Lower margins decreased earnings by $2.2 billion, driven mainly by significantly weaker industry refining and marketing margins. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $140 million. Other effects decreased earnings by $510 million, mainly reflecting lower gains on asset sales. ", "Sequentially, fourth quarter Downstream earnings decreased by $514 million. Margin effects reduced earnings by $650 million, reflecting lower industry refining and marketing margins. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $190 million, including favorable refining optimization impacts. Other factors decreased earnings by $50 million.", "Full year 2009 Downstream earnings were $1.8 billion, down $6.4 billion from 2008. Lower margins reduced earnings by $5.1 billion, primarily due to weaker industry refining margins. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $310 million, reflecting lower demand. Other factors reduced earnings by $990 million, mainly reflecting lower gains from asset sales. ", "Turning now to our Chemical business, during the quarter Exxon Mobil announced completion and start up of an expansion at our Rotterdam Aromatics Plant, located in The Netherlands. The expansion was completed on schedule and has made this world scale plant our largest Paris Island production facility. The new unit employs Exxon Mobil\u2019s proprietary technology to improve selectivity, generate less waste and reduce energy requirements.", "In November, Exxon Mobil Chemicals affiliate, TonenGeneral and Toray Industries, announced an agreement to establish a joint venture to develop, manufacture and sell lithium ion battery separator film. The joint venture will build on Exxon Mobil\u2019s more than 20 years of experience and success in providing separator films, as well as support the development of next generation films for the lithium ion battery market.", "And finally, Exxon Mobil Chemical and Qatar Petroleum announced an agreement to progress the joint development of a world scale petrochemical complex in Ras Laffan Industrial City, Qatar. The proposed complex would include the world\u2019s largest steam cracker and polyethylene plants and one of the world\u2019s largest ethylene glycol plants. The project will employ Exxon Mobil\u2019s proprietary processes and product technologies and will utilize feedstocks from gas development projects in Qatar\u2019s North Field to produce a range of premium products.", "Turning now to Chemical operating results, fourth quarter Chemical earnings were $716 million, up $560 million from the fourth quarter of 2008. Stronger margins improved earnings by $190 million, reflecting higher realizations. Higher volumes also increased earnings by $190 million. Other effects improved earnings by $180 million, mainly due to lower hurricane related costs. Sequentially, fourth quarter Chemical earnings decreased by $160 million. Lower margins decreased earnings by $200 million. Positive volume and mix effects increased earnings by $80 million, mainly due to higher commodity volumes. Other effects were a negative $40 million. ", "Full year 2009 Chemical earnings were $2.3 billion, down $650 million from 2008. Weaker margins reduced earnings by $340 million. Lower volumes decreased earnings by $190 million, reflecting the impact of the economic slowdown. Other effects were a negative $120 million. ", "Turning now to our Corporate and Financing segment, Corporate and Financing expenses during the quarter were $257 million versus $383 million in the fourth quarter last year. The decrease reflects favorable tax effects. For the full year 2009, expenses excluding special items were $1.8 billion compared to $830 million in 2008, mainly reflecting lower interest income. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 45% and for the full year 2009, the effective tax rate was 47%. At the end of the fourth quarter, our cash balance was $10.7 billion and debt was $9.5 billion. ", "The corporation distributed $4 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $2 billion was distributed to purchase shares in excess of dilution. For the full year 2009, we distributed a total of $26 billion to shareholders, including $18 billion to purchase shares in excess of dilution, which reduced shares outstanding by 5%, further demonstrating our commitment to return cash to our shareholders. ", "In the first quarter of 2010, share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to continue at a pace consistent with fourth quarter 2009 of $2 billion. However, total purchases for the quarter may be less due to trading restrictions following the filing of XTO Energy\u2019s merger proxy.", "CapEx in the fourth quarter was $8.3 billion, an increase of 21% from fourth quarter 2008. Full year 2009 CapEx was a record $27.1 billion, nearly $1 billion higher than 2008. In spite of the global economic downturn, we continue to invest at record levels in advantaged projects to help meet global demand for crude oil, natural gas and finished products.", "Operating expense for the full year 2009 was down 8% or about $6 billion from full year 2008. While energy and foreign exchange impacts were a big part of the reduction, we achieved over $1 billion in efficiencies and an additional $1 billion in savings related to our ongoing asset divestment program. These expense reductions were partly offset by new, Upstream project start ups, higher activity levels including exploration, and increased pension expense. This performance reflects our ongoing very active cost management efforts. ", "In summary, these results reflect the soundness of Exxon Mobil\u2019s business model. Our ability to succeed, even during the volatile business conditions in 2009, demonstrates that our long term commitment to the integrity of our operations, disciplined investment approach and integrated business model continue to deliver superior results.", "Finally, I would like to mention two upcoming events. First in mid-February we will be releasing our 2009 Reserves Performance Data. Second, as many of you will already have seen, our Analysts Meeting this year will take place on Thursday, March 11. This will include a live audio webcast beginning at 9:00 AM Eastern, 8:00 AM Central Time. Exxon Mobil\u2019s presenters will be led by Chairman and CEO, Rex Tillerson. ", "Before I take your questions, and as you can appreciate, I will not have any further comment at this time related to the Exxon Mobil and XTO Energy agreement. I would now be happy to take your question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "Thank you, Mr. Rosenthal. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "I was just going to clarify a previous comment you\u2019ve made on the Exxon, XTO deal which is that the guidance was for completion in Q2 of this year. I assume that given the comments you made about the filings that there\u2019s every reason to believe that\u2019s still an achievable target.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, I would expect that\u2019s an achievable target.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "", "If you could just quickly on the volume side, you mentioned that you had a record number of start ups I believe, 400,000 barrels a day of 2009 start ups for 2010 volumes at 400,000 barrels a day. What was the exit rate, David, on those projects as we left 2009 to give me an idea of how much incremental volume you\u2019ll be looking at in 2010?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure, Paul. The exit rate was about 100,000 barrels a day and as we look at the full year 2010 we would expect to get another 300,000 barrels a day. So we ended the fourth quarter on a very strong momentum coming into 2010 and all of those projects that I mentioned are up and running and performing very well.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "", "If I could just reach around in a couple of the volumes I believe although you mentioned Sakhalin, some technical achievements at Sakhalin, I believe that there\u2019s been some decline issues there. I wonder if you could help me just by stripping out the Russian Caspian performance a little bit, both in the oil and gas side from what you\u2019ve released?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, I think we\u2019ve seen some normal decline in Sakhalin, but Paul I\u2019ll tell you there\u2019s nothing over there that\u2019s unexpected or out of the ordinary as we finished up the year and heading into this year. But really I\u2019d just tell you it\u2019s in line with our expectations.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "", "But would it be fair to say that Russia for example Russian oil production was down, but you\u2019ve got overall Russia Caspian volumes up quite strongly?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Oh, sure. Yes. Russia was down but we did get a nice uptick at [Tanges] in Russia with the expansion start up there.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "", "And the gas on the Russia Caspian side, could you talk a bit about that?", "David S. Rosenthal", "On the gas side I think what we\u2019ve seen there, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen anything substantial there.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "", "Again on volumes I\u2019m imagining that the cold weather in Europe is going to be a big driver for you. I don\u2019t know the extent to which it was an impact in Q4, but any further comment you can make about how weather will be impacting your European volumes would be great.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure. As you noted, the weather in the fourth quarter did drive our European demand a fair amount in the fourth quarter. In particular if we look sequentially relative to the third quarter, it was a fairly sizable increase there. So what you really saw in the fourth quarter on those gas volumes, ramp up in Qatar and those projects continue to ramp up and then of course a nice uptick in European gas volumes. So if you look at our European gas volumes, those are going to be driven by the cold weather.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Doug Terreson - ISI Group.", "Doug Terreson - ISI Group", "", "In refining and marketing, isn\u2019t it true conditions have been challenging for everybody and I think you guys have posted losses three quarters in a row which I think is the first such situation in at least a decade or maybe more. And so on this point I wanted to see whether there was some specific industry trends that have proven surprising to Exxon in recent quarters and if so, what were they? And number two, are there any new strategies or tactics that you guys are employing or thinking about which might allow the company to arrest this trend?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Well as you mentioned, Doug, the industry trends over the full year 2009 really reflect just a challenging environment overall. We\u2019ve seen lower demand, lower to margins, product inventories have been at high levels. But as we\u2019ve looked across the year and looked at what we can do to maintain our competitive position, I would focus on a couple of things that we can control that we work real hard. Of course operational excellence and safety in our refineries; taking advantage of our integration, particularly if you\u2019re looking relative to standalone refiners; as you know most of our large refining sites are fully integrated with [inaudible] and the lubes business. So we\u2019re seeing a nice advantage to integration and of course that gets back to the whole issue of molecule management and the ability to really optimize around the complete site so that we can take advantage of feed slates coming in and then optimize our products on the outward side, so that we\u2019re optimizing both the refining side of the business as well as chemicals. ", "So certainly a tough year, tough for everybody, we feel though some of our competitive strengths have helped us a bit in what has been a very tough environment. In terms of new strategies going forward, we are aware that some of our competitors have recently announced restructurings in their Downstream business. I think from our perspective though we\u2019ve always been very efficient in our operations and again taking advantage of the competitive strengths that we\u2019ve had. But I\u2019d also like to note that we have been making changes to our portfolio literally over the last several years, on an ongoing basis. I might just mention a couple. If we look back over the last many years we have divested interests in about ten refineries, including Ingolstadt in 2007 and Okinawa in 2008 at a period when the environment was literally the opposite of what we see today. We\u2019ve also divested about 5,000 miles of pipeline assets, 145 product terminals, several lube plants and 18,000 retail stations. So that effort is ongoing. ", "We\u2019re very pleased with what we\u2019ve done and as always we\u2019re open to discussion. But we don\u2019t see a need right now for any significant restructurings at this time, but we\u2019ll see how things go. But we\u2019re in pretty good shape right now.", "Doug Terreson - ISI Group", "", "In Iraq you mentioned a few minutes ago about the West Qurna agreement that you guys talked about last week and on this project, you know, maybe it\u2019s preliminary but maybe it\u2019s not, I just wanted to see if you could provide any additional insight as to how you envision the investment and output profile unfolding in coming years.", "David S. Rosenthal", "If you look at Iraq, first of all I\u2019d like to say that we are very pleased to have reached this agreement on what is a very significant new opportunity for us and we have commenced development planning. But as we really just commenced the planning and are looking at this, really not in a position to give a lot of details in terms of timing but the agreement does call for us to raise plateau production by about 2 million barrels a day. But we\u2019re just getting after that and we\u2019re very excited.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Neil McMahon - Sanford Bernstein.", "Neil McMahon - Sanford Bernstein", "I\u2019ve got a few questions. The first is really an update on the fracing testimony that you undertook on January 20. Really any fallout or feedback from that and any update would be great. And secondly any further news on Kosmos assets in Ghana and where you stand there.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Thanks, Neil. Yes, on fracing we did have a very successful meeting recently. There hasn\u2019t been any as you term fallout from that necessarily. I think it\u2019s good that we\u2019re having the opportunity to educate everybody on hydraulic fracing and the very importance of these new shale gas plays to meeting the U.S.\u2019s energy needs for decades to come. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware, there\u2019s been over 1 million wells fraced over the last many, many years and there\u2019s really been no documented case of any issues. And the industry has a lot of processes and procedures and technologies in place to insure that that doesn\u2019t happen. And further I\u2019ll just say that careful studies by the EPA and the Groundwater Protection Council have not recorded any incidence of groundwater contamination attributable to hydraulic fracing so we continue to press on. The industry continues to press on and we look forward to opportunities to dialog again about this very important resource development opportunity that we have in the U.S.", "In terms of your second question, I really don\u2019t have any news or any further comments to make.", "Neil McMahon - Sanford Bernstein", "", "Really just expanding on the Philippines exploration program and maybe just if you could outline the further exploration program for the tier. And by the way, congratulations on your Terminal of the Year Award. I wasn\u2019t aware that there was one.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Thank you. Let\u2019s talk about the Philippines. We did successfully drill our first well, the [Dhabu Quan] One well and that prospect has found gas in several areas. We are now on our second well in the area and are very pleased with the preliminary results. It is preliminary. It\u2019s a new play concept but to date we\u2019re feeling pretty good about how things are going.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Robert Kessler - Simmons & Company International.", "Robert Kessler - Simmons & Company International", "One quick clarification on the numbers and then a more of a strategic one. On the numbers looking at your Upstream variance sequentially 3Q versus 4Q, you\u2019ve got a positive $380 million there. Wondering if you might be able to further clarify the components adding to that.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure. I\u2019ll tell you first off it\u2019s a lot of items, none of which individually are significant. We did see some favorable tax effects but we also had some positive foreign exchange in there and actually some lower operating expense excluding the higher exploration activity. So just a number of factors. All were positive sequentially but nothing noteworthy on an individual basis.", "Robert Kessler - Simmons & Company International", "", "On a more strategic front, I hope this question won\u2019t be rejected by your XTO no comment one, but with respect to your global kind of shale strategy you\u2019ve obviously added a lot in recent years and will be adding quite a bit more with the XTO deal on the shale gas side, but that sort of begs a question. With your crude oil volumes declining globally year on year and your natural gas production already growing year on year before the transaction and with crude oil at a substantial premium to gas what about the oil shale side? Things like the [Balkan]. Might you get more aggressive in those opportunities in the Exxon Mobil portfolio?", "David S. Rosenthal", "First of all, I will have to say I don\u2019t have any comment on the XTO Energy transaction but nonetheless let me step back and talk about our global unconventional position. It\u2019s not a strategic shift. We are not shifting away from oil to gas. We have a number of projects underway to in fact increase oil production, most notably our Kearl Project which I\u2019ll just mention here is ramping up quickly and things are going very well there. And as you know, Phase 1 of that is expected to deliver over 100,000 barrels a day. So it\u2019s not a strategic shift. It is a tremendous opportunity for us. We have been acquiring these unconventional resources at a very low entry cost with a very long holding period. We\u2019re pleased that we\u2019ve seen both a geographic diversity across the U.S., at Marcellus I mentioned, Horn River in Canada, Germany, Eastern Europe, we\u2019ve got shale gas, tight gas, coalbed methane acreage. So the portfolio is growing nicely and again our key strategy is to acquire attractive resources that we can develop and monetize to create shareholder value.", "The Balkan in particular, we\u2019ll see how things go but again we are very pleased with this portfolio we\u2019ve amassed and have very robust plans underway to assess and develop and exploit those resources.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "Just wanted to clarify, first I think earlier you had said your exit of 100,000 [boe] per day and expect an additional 300,000 barrels per day of the production. You said natural exit on all this. Are you talking about the gross and is it just on Qatar or are you talking about your all four growth projects?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, let me clarify that. Those numbers the 100 plus the 300 equals 400 were net barrels and those were all start ups in 2009. And then of course as we move into 2010, we\u2019ll be bringing on line the fourth Qatar Train which is we\u2019ve got gas flow into it and we would expect first LNG in the coming weeks. But you know one thing I will say, Paul, we\u2019ll be giving you and everybody the full update and story on our production volume outlook for 2010, how the projects are coming along, what that ramp up\u2019s going to look like. And we look forward to giving you that full story here in just about a month.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "", "When you say 100,000 barrel per day for the quarter, I assume you\u2019re talking about your entire company portfolio and not just in Qatar, right?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes. That\u2019s the entire portfolio but of course you know that\u2019s out of all our projects for the year. Of course a big piece of that is of course the Qatar project.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "", "On a related subject on Qatar, can you share with us how much is the LNG gas that had previously [inaudible] or that\u2019s supposed to shift to U.S. and now you may be looking for other charge and selling it into the high end net effect outside market like in Asia and Europe?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Paul, without getting into any specific figures or numbers, I would just say that as you know across the Qatar projects we\u2019ve got a portfolio of sales, some of which are fixed and are turned up. But then a number of them are available, have the flexibility to be diverted to whichever market we can get the best realization and value for. And as you would expect, we are actively pursuing those options, literally on a daily basis. But I really couldn\u2019t give you any specific volumes or percentages. ", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "", "The Qatar new Train that is actually tailored specifically for the U.S. market, if that assumption is correct or that is actually two Train [warnings]?", "David S. Rosenthal", "I wouldn\u2019t say that anything is particularly tailored to any one particular market. Our strategy is to be flexible. We did start up South Hook in the Adriatic this past year. We would expect to see the Golden Pass LNG terminal come on in the second half of this year and be ready to receive LNG. But we\u2019re also taking advantage when we have opportunities even to sell spot cargoes into the Asia Pacific area. So wherever we can get the best net back, wherever the demand is, that\u2019s where our cargoes are going.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "", "One, on Iraq, based on the current contract terms I presume you will not be allowed to book any reserve under the SEC definition. I just want to clarify on that. And secondly then, if you will be able to share with us what is the price finalization impact or any given to gain or loss in the quarter?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure. Let me hit those. They\u2019re two separate questions, Paul. When we look at the contract in Iraq and we look at SEC rules, right now we don\u2019t see any reason at this time why we would not book reserves. So again consistent with the guidelines in the contract right now, we think we will be able to book reserves.", "If we look at price finalization in the quarter, are you looking at just the fourth quarter of \u201909?", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "Yes sir.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, that number on an absolute basis was less than $100 million.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "", "$100 million loss or $100 million gain?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Just under $100 million loss.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "", "And is it 50-50 between U.S. and international or?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, pretty close. I mean the number literally is not that much. But yes, close enough.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "", "And how about inventory gain or loss? Anything?", "David S. Rosenthal", "You know interestingly enough if we look at the LIFO effects for example in the absolute basis for 2009, about $200 million across the Downstream, positive. But again not a lot of money there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi.", "Faisel Khan - Citi", "Just a couple questions, one on exploration expense. Your exploration expense seems to have doubled over the course of the year. Can you talk about what\u2019s driving that and if that represents your level of activity going forward as well?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, if you look at our exploration expense across the year it did increase significantly in \u201909 over \u201908, really reflecting just a very robust exploration program that we had across the year. So we had a lot of activity which drive seismic costs and we also had dry hole expense associated with some deepwater wells. But yes, I mean ramp up the activity, expenses go up a little bit, but again we are as you know working on a very extensive exploration program in \u201909 and as we move into 2010 as well.", "Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi", "", "And what major exploration wells are you drilling right now?", "David S. Rosenthal", "If you look at what\u2019s going on in the business right now, we\u2019ve got a number of wells actually drilling. We have as I mentioned earlier our second well in the Philippines is under way. We\u2019re also drilling our second well in Libya and preparing to drill a number of other wells as the year progresses. But again, I\u2019ll say that we\u2019re looking forward to giving you a complete rundown on all the wells for 2010 and the continuation again of this robust program we started in March. And we\u2019ll talk about the Black Sea and we\u2019ll talk about a number of other areas, both in conventional and unconventional. And we\u2019ll look forward to talking a lot about that in March.", "Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi", "", "CapEx sequentially was up quarter over quarter. Is that because of timing of projects or should we consider that level of CapEx is going to continue into the next few quarters?", "David S. Rosenthal", "CapEx was up in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, really driven by a couple of events. We had the Firebag acquisition that I mentioned up in Canada, that high quality acreage opportunity that we had. We also had some other acreage position captures elsewhere. And then as you mentioned we saw a nice ramp up in project work, Kearl for example, and a number of other projects. So yes, we finished the year strong but as expected and certainly reflecting just the success we\u2019re seeing, both acquiring new resources as well as the continued development with the projects that we have in the pipeline.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Doug Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch.", "Doug Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Just a couple of quick things, I hope. First one is real easy. It looks like you had the working capital build and the cash flow statement. Just quantify that for us, please?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, if you look in the fourth quarter of \u201909 versus the fourth quarter of \u201908, we had a little working capital impact, a few hundred million dollars but nothing real large.", "Doug Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "What about the absolute, David?", "David S. Rosenthal", "The absolute change if you look just in the fourth quarter, not much, a couple hundred million dollars.", "Doug Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "", "The more detailed one, David, was I want to kind of build on one of the earlier questions. I think it was from Jeff, regarding the $180 million. First of all, what was the absolute impact in the fourth quarter of all those small bits and pieces? Because what I\u2019ve been watching here and what I\u2019m trying to really get a handle on is your, on a very simple basis, your capture rate on the Upstream in the first three quarters of 2009 deteriorated quite substantially I guess versus the legacy portfolio. Something you actually showed in your strategy presentation back in \u201906 to demonstrate how you were securing the leverage to the Upstream, but it looks like it\u2019s deteriorating as your production has become more gassy and I\u2019m just trying to understand what\u2019s going on there. If you could offer any suggestions, that would be great.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure, Doug. You know as we look across the year and we look particularly heading into the fourth quarter, again I would say if I look sequentially in that $380 was really just a number of items, a few tax items, but again nothing substantial. We did see and this may be a big piece of what you\u2019re looking at, we did see a reduction in ongoing operating expenses. You know I think we\u2019ve seen a lot of change in our expenses over the years. We\u2019ve had these major projects start up and ramp up and the timing of those, relative to the revenues that those projects start generating, and so I think what you\u2019re seeing now as we head into the fourth quarter you\u2019re really seeing all of the projects up, running flat out, and generating the net profit that we expect.", "But other than that, I really wouldn\u2019t have anything specific to note.", "Doug Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "", "Just to be clear, David, and I don\u2019t want to belabor the point, so if the $380 million was sequential, what was the absolute in the quarter of positive [one] effects?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, Doug, we don\u2019t typically give the value of those things because there\u2019s just a number of them every quarter, and I\u2019d be running down a long list and some would be positive and some would be negative. But I really think the real key though is as we look at the year progresses, we\u2019re really starting to see things come online the way we expect. If you look at our net income per barrel in the fourth quarter, the $15 that was in line with our expectations. So as I look at all of this I\u2019d really just say we\u2019re executing the plan and we ended the year strong. I mean we ended the year strong from an operational standpoint, a production standpoint and an earnings standpoint. And we look forward to that momentum continuing on as the year gets started.", "Doug Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "", "The tax rate as the mix changes with all these new projects, could you offer any kind of guidance as to what you\u2019d say a run rate tax rate as we move through in 2010?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Well, Doug, you hit the word right on the head. It\u2019s mix. It\u2019s mix of the businesses, Upstream versus Downstream versus Chemical, the geographic mix of those businesses within the business lines, and as we move quarter-to-quarter in looking down the road I tell you I really couldn\u2019t give you any guidance that I think would be helpful. We\u2019ll just have to see how the businesses perform, where those businesses are performing, how the economy goes over the course of the year will of course drive a lot of our earnings. And we\u2019ll just have to see how that shakes out. But it really is a mix effect as I look at the last couple of quarters.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research Equities.", "Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research Equities", "I just want to clarify, I think you made a comment that you expected all the P&G, LNG volumes to be marketed this year. I still have about 1.3 million tons per annum, looks to me that hasn\u2019t been contracted. So if you could just confirm that and then also talk about how the Pacific Basin LNG markets are looking now, given your own efforts as well as the Gorgon Project, whether they\u2019re fairly well satiated facts and figures or if there\u2019s still appetite there.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Let\u2019s hit the first one on the P&G, LNG, you\u2019re right. We still are firming up the rest of those SPAs. We\u2019re close to completion of the balance and would expect to have those wrapped up here in the first quarter as well as the other conditions for financing. So that one progressing right along as we expected and we continue to be pleased with that. When we look at the overall market for the Pacific Basin LNG business, I think as you\u2019ve seen we\u2019ve generated a bit of an advantage as an early mover into that market, both out of Qatar and now P&G and Grogon. So we\u2019re confident that our projects are well positioned and well timed and from a capital efficiency and technology standpoint will deliver a competitive advantage for us as the years go by. So we\u2019re still very pleased with these investment decisions. We\u2019re happy with how things are progressing and I think the ability for us to leverage both our project development experience as well as our marketing advantages that we\u2019ve really gained over the last few years are going to be very helpful and should lead to very successful projects for us.", "Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research Equities", "", "Is it safe to say, though, that you\u2019re quite happy to have all your volumes contracted right now and not having to be out in the marketplace?", "David S. Rosenthal", "I think I\u2019d say we\u2019re very pleased with how things are going and wouldn\u2019t change anything looking back. So no, we\u2019re happy with how things are going.", "Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research Equities", "", "On the Ras Laffan petrochemical project, David, will you be participating in the Upstream supply feedstock to that project?", "David S. Rosenthal", "No, that\u2019s a joint venture between us and Qatar Petroleum really on the Chemical side. Although you know it\u2019ll be sourced from a number of different projects out of the North Field, but I wouldn\u2019t want to get into anything specific in terms of which development or timing of that. It\u2019s really a very large, Chemical investment designed to take advantage of the feedstocks that are on offer as well as the technology and proprietary products that we can produce out of that.

So I\u2019d say give us a little time to sort those things out and we\u2019ll be giving more information on Iraq as we go forward.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "", "Give me an update, if you could, on where things stand on Upper Zakum?", "David S. Rosenthal", "From what regard in particular, Mark?", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "", "In terms of the project that you\u2019re undertaking there.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Oh, sure, the project is performing well. We\u2019re meeting expectations as we apply technologies and the expertise that we brought to the project. And the results that we\u2019re seeing are meeting expectations. And I think as we look overall at that project, it\u2019s very positive and we\u2019ve been able to do a number of things there to increase those volumes, just as we had planned to do. So thank you for the question. That\u2019s a success story for us.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "", "Can you quantify the increase you\u2019ve achieved at all?", "David S. Rosenthal", "No, for commercial reasons we really can\u2019t give that specific number.", "Operator", "And at this time I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to David Rosenthal for closing comments.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Thank you very much. Despite the challenging economic environment, we remain confident that our long term perspective, financial strength and disciplined investment approach will continue to deliver superior, differentiated results and positions us well for the future. I\u2019d like to thank everybody for your time today and we look forward to seeing you in March. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And this does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

[Operator Instructions] At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's teleconference and webcast on our first quarter 2010 financial and operating results. As you are aware from this morning's press release, ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings and operating performance were solid, reflecting the strength of our business model during this period of slow and uncertain economic recovery from the global recession.", "Lower economic activity is impacting near-term supply and demand balances, resulting in weak natural gas prices and downstream margins. Crude oil prices however, are well above levels of a year ago. Chemical performance was strong and continues to reflect the value of our industry-leading integration, scale and geographic diversity.", "Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement. Statements of future events or conditions are forward-looking statements. Actual results, including resource recoveries, volume growth and project outcomes could differ materially due to factors I discussed and factors noted in our SEC filings. Please see factors affecting future results and the Form 8-K we furnished this morning, which are available through the Investors Section of our website. Please also see the frequently used terms and the 2009 financial and operating review on our website. This material defines key terms I will use today and shows ExxonMobil's net interest in specific projects.", "Now I am pleased to turn your attention to the first quarter results. ExxonMobil's first quarter 2010 earnings and earnings excluding special items were $6.3 billion, an increase of $1.8 billion from the first quarter of 2009, reflecting an increase in crude oil prices and strong chemical results, partly offset by lower natural gas realizations and continued depressed downstream margins. Earnings per share were $1.33, up $0.41 from a year ago. These results include a charge of about $200 million or $0.04 per share, associated with the U.S. healthcare legislation signed into law in March of 2010.", "During the first quarter of 2010, ExxonMobil distributed nearly $4 billion to shareholders, including dividends of $2 billion and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding of about $2 billion. Again, demonstrating our commitment to return cash to shareholders.", "With regard to the current status of the XTO transaction, we continue to work cooperatively with the regulatory agencies involved in reviewing the proposed transaction. On March 9, the Dutch competition authority provided regulatory clearance of the pending merger. The applicable waiting period provided under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act expired on March 15 without the issuance of the second request.", "On April 20, ExxonMobil filed amendment number two to the S-4 Registration Statement and we continued to progress the SEC review process. Closing of the transaction remains subject to final regulatory clearance and approval by the shareholders of XTO Energy. We continue to anticipate completion in the second quarter.", "Turning now to our business line results and some of the milestones we have achieved since the last earnings call. First, in the upstream. During the quarter, ExxonMobil completed the remaining sales and purchase agreement and financing arrangements associated with the Papua New Guinea LNG project. The investment for the initial phase of the project is estimated at $15 billion, and first LNG deliveries are expected in 2014. Over its 30-year life, PNG LNG is expected to produce over 9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. During the quarter, we completed the start up of RasGas Train 7. This is the fourth 7.8 million ton per year LNG Trains brought online by our joint ventures with Qatar Petroleum in the last 12 months.", "ExxonMobil now has an interest in 12 LNG trains in Qatar with a combined capacity of 62 million tons per year. In total, we expect three major startups in 2010, including RasGas Train 7 in Qatar, the Sakhalin-1 Odoptu project in Russia and the Golden Pass to LNG terminal in Texas. In January, we announced the completion of two-out-of-seven planned extended-reach wells, associated with the Sakhalin-1 Odoptu field. Construction of the Golden Pass LNG regasification terminal continues to progress. Both projects are expected to start up in the second half of 2010.", "ExxonMobil continues to progress plans to redevelop and expand the West Qurna-1 field in southern Iraq. The agreement with the Iraq Ministry of Oil took effect on March 1. We have completed initial testing to establish the baseline production rate. Our team has been in-country to begin working with our counterparts at the South Oil Company to develop the initial work programs. We are very excited about this significant new opportunity, and look forward to working for the government of Iraq and the South Oil Company to implement this important project.", "Moving to exploration. We are pleased with our recent drilling results in the Gulf of Mexico and plan an appraisal well on one of our two discoveries on our Keathley Canyon block. As part of our 2010 exploration program, we recently completed our second deepwater well in the Mediterranean Sea, offshore Libya. In Indonesia, we continued drilling in the Mandar block in the Southern Makassar Basin and are planning to drill an additional wildcat well in the Philippines this year.", "Moving to our unconventional gas exploration, I would like to give you an update on some recent activities across our global portfolio. In the Horn River shale gas play, we continue to evaluate our significant acreage position and have drilled 10 wells over the winter. We are currently preparing to complete and test the two horizontal wells. We are also progressing further shale gas drilling in the Haynesville where we are now drilling our second well. In the Eagle Ford shale gas play, we are preparing for drilling operations and in the Piceance tight gas play, we are continuing Phase 1 development drilling. Drilling also continues on our Marcellus acreage.", "And finally in Indonesia, we have acquired interest in the prospective coal bed methane acreage in the Barito Basin and are developing our evaluation program. With regard to our deepwater portfolio, in the Black Sea, ExxonMobil completed a farming agreement with Petrobras and the Turkish National Oil Company, TPAO, to explore for hydrocarbons offshore Turkey. Under the terms of the agreement, ExxonMobil will hold a 25% interest in three sub-blocks covering over 7.4 million acres. Together with our partners, we are currently drilling to Samsun [ph] line exploration well. Including our existing expiration licenses in Turkey and Romania, where we have a 50% interest, this brings ExxonMobil's total acreage in the Black Sea to over 16 million acres. In Africa, ExxonMobil farmed in to Statoil's deepwater Block II offshore Tanzania. As a result to the farming, ExxonMobil will receive a 35% interest in the 2.7 million-acre block. This block is considered a frontier exploration area with 2D seismic acquisition completed in 2008. Currently, a 3D seismic survey is being acquired in the block.", "Turning now to the upstream operating results. Upstream earnings into first quarter were $5.8 billion, up $2.3 billion from the first quarter of 2009. Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel were $14.81 in the first quarter of 2010. Higher crude oil prices, partly offset by lower natural gas realizations, increased earnings by $2.5 billion.", "Worldwide liquids realizations were up $33 per barrel in the quarter, while natural gas realizations were down $1.56 per kcf from first quarter of 2009. Higher natural gas volumes increased earnings by $190 million, while other effects reduced earnings by $380 million, due primarily to increased exploration and operating expense reflecting higher activity level.", "In total, first quarter 2010 oil equivalent volumes increased 4 1/2% from the first quarter of last year, driven by major project ramp up. Entitlement volume effects, including price and spend impacts and PSE net interest reductions reduced volumes by 123,000 barrels per day. While lower OPEC quota impacts increased volumes by 70,000 barrels per day.", "Excluding the impact of lower entitlement volumes, quota effects and divestments, production was up nearly 6%. Project ramp ups in Qatar and Kazakhstan  more than offset net field decline.", "Liquids production decreased 62,000 barrels per day or 2.5% from the first quarter last year. Excluding impacts related to lower entitlement volumes, quota effects and divestments, production was down about 1%. Net field decline was partially offset by the project ramp ups in Qatar and Kazakhstan. Gas volumes increased 1.5 billion cubic feet per day or nearly 15%, versus the first quarter of 2009, driven by new project volumes in Qatar and higher demand in Europe, partly offset by net fuel decline. ", "Turning now to the sequential comparison. Versus the fourth quarter of 2009, upstream earnings increased by just over $30 million. Overall, realizations increased earnings by $310 million due to higher natural gas and liquids realizations. Volume and mix effects were positive $30 million, as the benefit of higher natural gas volumes was partly offset by lower liquid sales volumes. Other items reduced earnings by $310 million, primarily due to negative foreign exchange impacts and the absence of fourth quarter favorable tax items. Liquids production increased 1%, mainly reflecting the impact of new project volumes. Natural gas production was up over 9%, driven by seasonally higher demand in Europe and new project volumes in Qatar. In total, oil equivalent volumes were up almost 4.5% from the fourth quarter. ", "Moving now to the downstream. ExxonMobil continues to progress plans to increase the supply of cleaner burning diesel at our Baytown, Baton Rouge and Antwerp refineries. High-pressure hydrotreater equipment is being delivered to our Antwerp, Belgium refinery and we anticipate projects start up by year end 2010.", "We also continued our activities to optimize refinery operations by expanding our crude flexibility. This quarter, ExxonMobil ran 30 crudes that were new to individual refineries. Finally, in our Lubes business, the Mobil 1 technology partnership with Vodafone McLaren and Mercedes  introduced a new lubricant and fuels package for use in the 2010 season. ExxonMobil also extended its partnership to provide Mobil 1 lubricant technology and engineering support to the Corvette racing team. ExxonMobil works closely with Corvette racing to develop and test new technologies to optimize powertrain performance, improve fuel economy benefits and increased horsepower without sacrificing engine durability.", "Turning now to the downstream operating results. Downstream earnings in the first quarter were $37 million, down $1.1 billion from the first quarter of 2009. Lower margins decreased earnings by $1.1 billion, driven primarily by significantly weaker industry refining margins. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $130 million, including the benefits from our refining optimization efforts. Other effects decreased earnings by $80 million, mainly due to negative foreign exchange effects.", "Turning now to the sequential comparison. First quarter downstream earnings increased by nearly $230 million compared to fourth quarter 2009. Higher margins increased earnings by $610 million due to improved industry refining margins. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $370 million, reflecting higher planned maintenance and turnaround activity, as well as lower seasonal fuel demand.", "Other factors decreased earnings by $10 million. ", "Turning now to our Chemical business. During the quarter, ExxonMobil's japanese affiliate TonenGeneral, announced the successful formation of a battery separator film joint venture with Toray Industries. The joint venture began operating on February 1 and combines ExxonMobil's Lithium-Ion Battery Separator Film business and technological expertise with Toray's plastic film processing precision and polymer science technology, in order to accelerate the development of battery separator films to a greater degree than either company could do alone.", "In our Polymers business. ExxonMobil announced the introduction of four new Vistamaxx grades. These products offer high performance for flexible film applications, allowing film manufacturers and end-users to achieve sustainability objectives with lower energy usage, reduced material consumption and improved ability for recycling. These new grades are another example of how ExxonMobil's premium products deliver value to both our customers and our shareholders. ", "Turning now to Chemical operating results, first quarter Chemical earnings were $1.2 billion, up $900 million from the first quarter 2009. Stronger margins improved earnings by $480 million, reflecting higher realizations and our continued feedstock advantage. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $180 million. Sales volumes were up nearly 20%, as volumes recover from the low level seen in the first quarter of 2009. Other effects improved earnings by $240 million, mainly due to asset management activities and the absence of hurricane-related costs. Sequentially, first quarter Chemical earnings increased by $530 million, higher margins increased earnings by $340 million, primarily in our Commodities business. Positive volume and mix effects increased earnings by $30 million. Other effects were a positive $160 million due to Asset Management activities and lower operating expense.", "Turning now to our Corporate and Financing segment. Corporate and Financing expenses were $800 million during the quarter, compared to $436 million in the first quarter 2009. This includes the charge of about $200 million or $0.04 per share associated with the U.S. healthcare legislation signed into law in March of 2010. These results also reflect the absence of favorable tax effects in the first quarter of 2009. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2009, Corporate and Financing expenses increased by about $540 million, reflecting the expense associated with the U.S. healthcare legislation and the absence of favorable tax effects in the fourth quarter of 2009. ", "The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 50%. At the end of the first quarter, our cash balance was $13.7 billion and debt was $9.5 million. The corporation distributed nearly $4 billion to shareholders in the first quarter through dividend and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, about $2 billion was distributed to purchase shares in excess of dilution. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to continue at a pace of about $2 billion in the second quarter of 2010. Total purchases for the quarter may be less due to trading restrictions related to the XTO Energy transaction. Yesterday, our board announced an increase in the quarterly dividend of nearly 5% to $0.44 per share. ExxonMobil has paid a dividend each year for more than a century and has increased its annual dividend payment for 28 consecutive years.", "CapEx on the first quarter was $6.9 billion, an increase of 19% from first quarter 2009. We continue to invest in robust projects through the business cycle to help meet global demand for crude oil, natural gas and finished products.", "In summary, these results reflect the strength of ExxonMobil's business model. We remain confident that our long-term perspective, financial strength and disciplined investment approach will continue to deliver superior, differentiated results and positions us well for the future. That concludes my prepared remarks. But before I take your questions, and as you can appreciate, I will not have any further comment at this time related to the ExxonMobil and XTO Energy agreement. I would now be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Jason Gammel of Macquarie.", "Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research", "I just wanted to ask you, we're starting to see now the volumetric effect of the Qatar LNG trends ramping up, and as we think about how that LNG is going to flow, do you have any limitations or expectations for how much volume you'd want to put into the U.S. market versus the European market? And then on a related question, have you taken any cargoes in the Golden Pass yet or can you let us know what the timing on the start of the Golden Pass would be?", "David Rosenthal", "As we look at our LNG volumes, we don't have any particular constraints on where that volume goes relative to Europe. As you know, most of our volumes coming out of Qatar, about 2/3 of them, go into the Asia-Pac area under term contracts index to oil. The rest of it does go into liquid markets, primarily in Europe and the U.S. And as you know with the diversion capabilities that we have associated with those volumes, we were able to place them into whichever one of those markets yields the best of value. As we look into volumes specifically into the U.S. Gulf Coast, the LNG regas facility at Golden Pass, it is progressing on the construction. It's expected to start up in the second half. So of course, we haven't taken any cargoes into Golden Pass, but we are looking forward to getting that project up and online later in the second half.", "Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research", "If I could continue on the natural gas theme, you've accumulated a massive position in acreage that's potential for shale in both Germany and Poland. Can you talk about any activity levels that are going on there? Are you shooting this seismic currently? Do you have plans on when you could potentially drill some first wells in those areas?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure, we continue to view the European shale acreage that we have is having great potential down the road for shale gas production. And across Europe as you know, we have a very large position in Germany, in both the shale gas, as well as coal bed methane. On the shale gas front, we have drilled three wells already. We continue to drill a number of core holes in the area and we also have some new seismic data that's being evaluated. And again, we're doing lots of core drilling, again, large acreage position, very long holding period. And we are really taking advantage of both of those aspects of that shale acreage to really understand what we've got through very thorough evaluation and then put a development program forward. We also in Germany have significant coal bed methane acreage and we have a long-term multi-year program in place to review, really starting with the existing data that's out there on the acreage, drill several core holes and then analyze what we have and get to work on that. But again, another large position, long holding period and we're really going to go about it in a disciplined pragmatic approach. In Poland, as you know, we have five exploration concessions there in the Podlasie and Lublin basins. Combined, we have over 1.3 million net acres. And here again, we're just getting started. The initial work programs that are underway include geologic studies, and within that, we are reprocessing some existing 2D seismic that are in the process of acquiring new seismic data. So early days across Europe, large acreage position, long holding period and a lot of exploration and analysis to go on in the next several years, but we remain very optimistic on the capability and feel real good about what we have.", "Operator", "We'll next go to Eli Bauman with The Benchmark Company.", "Eli Bauman", "I'm wondering what your utilization rates at Al-Khaleej Phase 2 was during the quarter? And then same question for RasGas 7. And did you ramp to full capacity at Qatargas by the end of the quarter so that you actually basically book that?", "David Rosenthal", "Let me take those in order. As we look at AKG-2 and we're in the process of ramping that up, we are not at full capacity just yet, but we are filling all of the local demand that's necessary and that project is going very well for us, and we continue to have the ability to ramp that up again to meet demand. If we look at RasGas Train 7, we did bring that up in the first quarter successfully. We did have some -- then go and take some downtime, really as part of the conditioning. But I'm pleased to report today that the train is back online and ramping up. If we look at the trains that started up last year, those trains, four, five, six are all performing very well. They are performing a full capacity and we are very pleased with the progress. In fact, I might make an overall comment on the projects that we started up in 2009. You might recall, we said that for a full year 2010, we would expect the new projects to contribute about 400 kbd year-over-year, and I can tell you we are up to about 370 today. So very pleased with the performance, very pleased with the strong volumes overall in the first quarter. Look forward to getting Train 7 ramped up and heading through the year and continuing with the production growth that we've seen.", "Operator", "And next we'll go to Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG", "David, firstly, if I could ask something of a technical question, just about the special -- which overolled into question about cash flow, if I could. Just a bit -- I felt into some way you declare no special items in the front page of the report, but then highlight that the $200 million healthcare legislation cost as the  highlight of the first quarter, I was just wondering why that wouldn't comprise as special when you highlight it? I know it's a technical question but I'm just perplexed.", "David Rosenthal", "Let me see if I can give you a technical answer to that. From an overall materiality standpoint in terms of size, it really doesn't get up to the level of being a special item in our release. We did think it was important to note it upfront in the comments simply because it was probably an item that the investment community was not aware of, and we wanted to make sure that you are aware of that impact on us.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG", "Kind of follow on, on specialties you like is that you clearly had extremely strong cash flow generations here. Almost a quite remarkable number. I was wondering if there was anything in there that you would highlight that isn't simply cash flow from the normal course of operations? Is there any other items that we should be aware of that will, for example, related to asset sales, legal issues or anything else that would have inflated that cash flow working capital as another obvious potential candidate?", "David Rosenthal", "Paul, you really hit the nail on the head with your last comment. If you look at the earnings and the asset sales, those as we showed in the press release and supplement, if you look at the first quarter of '09 relative to first quarter of '10, we were up almost for $4.5 billion on cash, about $2.1 billion of that came directly from earnings and asset sales. About another $0.5 billion from depreciation. But really, the balance of about $1.5 billion or so was without a working capital, and just reflected the net impact on payables and receivables from the crude price impacts, so it's really working capital. And then if you're looking sequentially at notionally $4.5 billion there, cash flow, other than the earnings item, it's all working capital. And again, it's all crude payables building across the quarter.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG", "I think you're telling me that the majority this side was the $1.5 billion working capital movement?", "David Rosenthal", "In the first quarter relative to the first quarter last year.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG", "Nevertheless, the cash position is strengthening. You've retained the buy back at $2 billion. A technical question regarding that. What are the precise limitations regarding the proxies? If you could just clarify that for us exactly. And then secondly, I'm assuming that you don't intend to continue building cash on the balance sheet. Your CapEx run rate is in line with previous guidance. I guess there's no reason to think that, that changes. You had a very large exploration expense here. I'm not sure that you'll be stepping up exploration spend but that would be interesting if you could address that. And then again, do we fall back to the old idea, given that even now some dividend increase that you've going to the flywheel of buyback later in the year?", "David Rosenthal", "Paul, let me see if I can digest all of that in order. Let me hit the -- first of all, let me step back and reconfirm our cash utilization. Of course, it's the same. It's unchanged. We fund the investment plan first. We funded growing dividend after that and then as you said, the additional cash becomes the flywheel for T share purchases and that has not changed. If we look specifically at the T share program, there's actually a couple of restrictions associated with the pending agreement with XTO. As you mentioned, there is a restriction of course once the proxy goes out for -- and then approval by the shareholders. But the other one that you may not be as well aware of is there are restrictions associated with the absolute number of shares that you can purchase, and you are limited to the number of shares you can purchase in the first quarter relative to the average of the run rates from prior periods. And I can tell you, during the quarter, we remained within those limits but did purchase all of the shares that we were allowed to. As we head into the future, and we talk about uses of cash, the guidance for overall CapEx remains at the $28 billion mark for the year. I don't have any updated or different number for you. We did see, as you would expect, with our very active and robust exploration program. That's ongoing. We did see some exploration expense in the quarter both related to drilling as well as other G&G activities and we continue to do that. I think overall though, what we're seeing is strong cash flow results from our operations. The impact of successfully ramping up these projects and getting the production growth. And then as we go forward, as always, we'll maintain our prudent disciplined approach to cash management, not make any mistakes and then use that cash to maximize shareholder value. But no changes in signal or approach.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG", "The buyback is basically held at the same level more for technical reasons than for any cash management reasons. Is there anything more you can say about the exploration expense just in terms of where the dry holes were and whether there's a rate of change there given that you're stepping up your activities that we should consider a run rate?", "David Rosenthal", "Let me come back to the exploration program as we ramp that up across the fourth quarter last year and certainly into the first quarter of this year. That program remains robust and active. We did have a couple of dry holes that in the first quarter, one in Libya and one in the Philippines and those did flow through to results. But again, we have a lot of other G&G and seismic related activity going on as we work through our very large acreage position, working on the drillable prospect inventory and certainly getting ready to sustain a very active drilling program across the rest of this year.", "Operator", "And next, we'll go to Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "Dave, in the international R&M, I'm still a bit perplexed why we did not see sequentially an improvement in earning from the fourth quarter. Given the European refunding margin may be up about $2, in Asia like Singapore or Japan, our margin is probably up $2 or $3 and you also have used quite a lot of heavy oil in your refining system, which is up about $2 sequentially. When you talk about the mix and margin impact, when I look at the refinery throughput from the fourth to the first quarter, they are down about 31 million barrel or $317 million net impact. That is a $12 per barrel after-tax impact per barrel. Is it awfully high? Is there any other things that we should be aware why we did not see the improvement?", "David Rosenthal", "Let me provide some clarity on our overall downstream result, in particularly, as you mentioned, sequentially. What we saw in the first quarter was we had a very large turnaround refinery load that was planned, a lot of planned maintenance. That way, you see the impact on that on our throughput volumes. And additionally, as you mentioned a lot of positive vectors on the margin front in the downstream in various geographies around the world. As you know, those margin improvements tended to trend up over the quarter and actually the best month of the quarter was in March. As it turns out, March was also the peak for us in terms of downtime and capacity that was online again for this maintenance that we had. And of course, given how skewed the timing was of both our capacity being offline for maintenance, as well as the margin improvement, that did impact our ability to capture those rising margins in the quarter. Now I can tell you that all of that maintenance and turnaround activity is going as planned and scheduled. It's going very well. We're in the process of finalizing that as we speak today, given the units are all buttoned up. Looking forward for a successful, safe restart of those units and taking advantage of whatever the market has on offer here in the second quarter.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "Dave, can you give us some rough idea then how much is your facility or what is your run rate in March, for your system?", "David Rosenthal", "I don't have any specifics on the rates. I can tell you though if you're looking sequentially across the quarter on average, we were down about 225,000 barrels a day on throughput, a big piece of that was in the Asia Pacific area. As you mentioned, things are improving there, but also in the U.S. and Europe. So about on average 200-and-some thousand barrels a  day in the quarter. I don't have a specific rate for March versus the other quarter -- the other months, but I can tell you qualitatively, as we brought these units down, March was our biggest month for downtime across the quarter and that leads to the impact that you're seeing or better said the impact that you are expecting.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "Can you give some comments about the exploration expense in the first quarter? Do you have a breakdown between the dry hole expense and the G&G in the first quarter?", "David Rosenthal", "Let me just mention -- I can tell you on a before-tax basis in the first quarter of 2010, that the total exploration expense was just under $700 million, and now it's up about $350 million on an expense basis from the first quarter of last year. If we flow through to the after-tax effect, it was the bulk of that $380 million impact that we showed in the earnings reconciliation quarter-on-quarter.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "So that means that the bulk of the increase is in the dry hole?", "David Rosenthal", "The dry hole was certainly a piece of it, but we also again, very active in the seismic area...", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "Dave, I was just wondering out of that $689 million of the pretax exploration expense, is it possible that you breakdown between the dry hole expense and the G&G?", "David Rosenthal", "Well, we don't normally provide that level of detail, but I'll tell you, order of magnitude, somewhere dry hole expense notionally a third, a quarter to a third, somewhere around that level.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "A third of the dry hole? You mentioned about the foreign exchange impact versus the fourth quarter, I'm using the fourth quarter as the base, can you give us what is the FX impact? Any tax impact, inventory impact or the price finalization impact by segment?", "David Rosenthal", "If we're looking at the downstream results, let me hit the forex for you first. If we're looking in total for the corporation, first quarter of this year versus first quarter of last year...", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "I can use -- versus first quarter, Dave, do you have that number?", "David Rosenthal", "If we look fourth quarter to this quarter, total for the corporation is about $200 million equally split between the upstream and the downstream negative.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "$200 million, $100 million for upstream, $100 million for downstream?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, notionally.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "How about any tax adjustment differences that we should be aware versus the fourth quarter also?", "David Rosenthal", "As we look from the fourth quarter to the first quarter across the company, we did have some positive tax items that I've mentioned in last quarter's earnings call. We did see some of those in the fourth quarter and we don't have any tax effects of any significance this quarter. So you do have the absence of those, but again, it's normal for us to have tax items every quarter. They tended to be positive in the fourth quarter and as we look in the first quarter this year, we didn't have a lot. I can tell you just in the Corp and Fin [Corporate and Financial] area, if you look at the change we had, say sequentially, from the fourth quarter to the first quarter and that number was just over $500 million. And that was basically the tax items and then the healthcare item were the two major contributors there.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "How about inventory and also the price finalization impact?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure, let me hit price finalization first. Probably interested in sequential mostly or...", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "Yes.", "David Rosenthal", "If I look at sequentially, there's really not much of an impact, about $40 million positive. So again, not a big impact sequentially.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "A final one on the cap rate. If we strip out the healthcare reform bill charge, that's about $600 million. I think, historically, you guys more in the $300 million to $500 million. Should we look at -- because you're not doing more activity, so your cap rate expense is going higher in the future or that this is just one of those quarter that you have a higher overall in the future that is still $300 million to $500 million is still on the ballpark a good proxy?", "David Rosenthal", "Let's talk about Corp and Fin. And actually, Paul, the prior guidance that we've given is to be between $500 million and $700 million in the Corp and Fin segment. And if you take out the healthcare impact, we'd have been right about $600 million, so we'd have been spot on in between that $500 million to $700 million. And I would say going forward, we would continue to go with the $500 million to $700 million. Obviously, excluding down the road any impacts of XTO, but on an ongoing basis, we would expect to be in that $500 million to $700 million range.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Doug Terreson of ISI.", "Douglas Terreson - Morgan Stanley Dean Witter", "I just had a couple of questions on, first your Venezuelan assets. Are you guys still on the jurisdictional phase or has the situation moved towards arbitration at the World Bank? Is there any update on that situation or next steps will be appreciated.", "David Rosenthal", "Sure, if we look at Venezuela, we are progressing down the path of arbitration. That process is continuing. I don't have any specific update other than that, other than the arbitration process continues.", "Douglas Terreson - Morgan Stanley Dean Witter", "And also, in Eastern Canada activities seem to be getting a little momentum between Hebron, Sable, Deep Panuke, Orphan, et cetera. And so I wanted to see if you guys could provide an update on this area and whether the effectiveness has changed for ExxonMobil during the past couple of years?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure, I think if you're really looking at that part of the world, the biggest impact for us this year is going to be drilling of the next Canada Orphan Basin well. We'll have that -- we would expect to have that down later this year.", "Operator", "We'll next go to Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "David, the project ramp ups, can you kind of tell us where we are in terms of how much you've actually got on stream now and what the remainings of ramp up in capacity is likely to be and perhaps a timeline that goes with that please?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure, let me start with the projects that came on last year and of course, the first quarter this year. As I mentioned earlier, all of the trains , all of the projects that we started up last year have ramped up and they're achieving their full production rates, Train 7 of course, is the next big one for us. And as I mentioned, that's starting up and moving on AKG Phase 2 is up. As we look later on down the year, we have the Odoptu Project scheduled to start up, sometime looks like in the second half of the year and that project is progressing. Again, though, I think the key metric for you is we talked about getting 400,000 barrels a day year-on-year out of the big projects. We had about 100,000 of that in last year. As we look at the first quarter, we're at 370,000. And I can tell you that in addition to the projects, our operations in the upstream are performing very well. When we look at our work program, we look at our uptime, when we look at the productivity of our heritage assets, everything is performing well. That yielded the very fine performance that you saw in the first quarter. And we would maintain the guidance that we gave in the analyst meeting in terms of full-year production outlook.", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I guess the issue which is kind of been, I guess, a favorite of mine over the years is that again when we look at your capture rate despite the increases in production, it's still showing a fairly substantial deterioration compared to your historical trend. Is it a very big change in DD&A that you can maybe share with us, to help us understand what's driving the net income level?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, let me offer a couple of comments on net income. First, I have to say we are very pleased with how the earnings came out in the first quarter. It came in right about we expected just under $15 a barrel overall. We're getting strong contributions from our investments in cutter and elsewhere. So on that part of the business, we're very pleased. If we look at the overall drivers or some of the other drivers of earnings per barrel, we have seen over the last several quarters and this quarter, really the upfront cost of the large projects that we're bringing on stream and we've seen that of course throughout last year and into this year. We've also seen, as I mentioned, the impact of the major exploration program we have underway. And I think as we talked at the analyst meeting, this program, in addition to the unconventional plays that I had talked about, is really focused on several very high potential, high-risk plays in the deepwater. And that activity has been very robust last year and this year, and of course, you do see the impact of that flowing through. If we look at D&D, of course with the ramp up in CapEx, as well as some of the industry specific inflation we saw over the last couple of years, we have seen an impact on D&D but when we look at our projects relative to others, and we look at the capital efficiency of those projects on a competitive basis, we still remain very confident that our projects are advantaged and will do just fine. But again, I think you really have to look at the impact of the high level of activity and the project start ups but not allow that near term or short-term impact overshadow what is truly a successful long-term project development and the buildup we're getting from that and will benefit from that down the road, as well as over the long-term, the benefits are our exploration programs. So if we look across the whole upstream portfolio, and the lifecycle of that portfolio, very active across the board from acreage capture to  exploration, to project development, to production, we're very pleased with how that's going and look forward to the long-term results that we'll derive from that.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "Number one, on the buyback, I know that since Exxon's always in the market and provides a 1Q forward outlook on the buyback rather than announcing a large plan than some of your peers, is there any consideration to a broader release following the XTO transaction? Particularly since you have been limiting your ability to be in the market or potentially to offset any dilution effects from that transaction?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure, let me hit the buyback. First of all, Evan, thank you for noting that we are still in the market. I believe we are the only integrated oil company that is still in the market buying shares back, but I'll also confirm your other comment about we only give a one quarter look ahead and I mentioned the $2 billion. I really wouldn't want to comment on anything that we might say down the road other than we'll continue to follow the cash disposition strategy that I've mentioned earlier, and we'll see how that progresses across the year but as we sit here today, no change in signal.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "Is your $2 billion that you got it to, that's assuming a close on June 30?", "David Rosenthal", "It's assuming a close in the second quarter.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "On the LNG side, generally, can you guide on the amounts of volumes that are under long term contracts. I know you've mentioned before but we've had four trains in the last 12 months? Has that changed at all post-RasGas 7? Or whether there's any effort to contract any portion, at least in the post-2015 period, there's going to be a lot of trains that will be marketing gas in the back half of this year?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure, let's step back and take a look at that LNG business. As we've said before, if we wrap our arms completely around our LNG business in cutter. About 2/3 of that is going out under term contract. The rest of it is going spot into liquid markets. As you've seen the recent trains startups the big trains that we've started up, that ratio flips around a little bit and you end up on the last few trains of about 2/3 of that going into the spot markets, the more liquid markets and about a third going at term. We don't have any, and again, the big terminals in the U.K. and then down the road in the U.S. We're very pleased with how that portfolios looks and the optionality and divertability that we get from that. We think over the long term, of course, as we have historically, we'll see fluctuations in prices and spreads between oil and gas and prices between various regions. But we like where we're sitting. We like where we are and we don't have any plans to try to change that. We kind of like the mix of contracts and markets that we have now.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.", "Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse", "Chemicals, good results, obviously benefiting from the recovery in the low nat gas prices well as it's oil field portfolio. I mean is there any outlook sentence you can make for the remainder of the year? I'm sure people are talking about weakness given your capacity coming on stream. And then the second question is around tax rates, which seemed a little high in Q1. I'm just wondering if there are any fundings in there or give us some guidance again for how you see the tax?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure, let's hit the Chemical business first. As you noted, we had a very strong results in the Chemical business, not just on the earnings side but you saw our volumes were up quite a bit, margins are up quite a bit and as we step back and look at the industry itself, in chemicals, we are seeing some demand recovery in most of the geographies. We benefited particularly well in the first quarter, as the industry particularly in North America saw a lot of downtime and so a number of producers particularly along the Gulf Coast were down for some planned and unplanned maintenance. That tightened up the market a bit and we were able to run our facilities flat out and capture the benefit of that. As we look globally across some of the other markets and as you know with our global footprint, we're kind of located everywhere -- the really growing markets are and the strong markets for our premium products. There again, there is industry tightness in the supply/demand balance because of the lower refinery throughput, but because of our integration and all of these major markets, we were able to optimize across the refining and chemical circuit and then again benefit greatly from the market and what it had to offer. So, very pleased with the results of the business but I think more to the point -- it really demonstrates the benefits that we have in the Chemical business with the scale with the integration, with the premium products, feedstock flexibility, regardless of geography and you kind of saw all of that hitting home at the same time. So we're very pleased. As we look out over the balance of the year, of course, the number one driver of any chemical results is going to be the pace and breadth of any economic recovery globally, particularly in North America and Europe and we'll see how that plays out. We know there is, of course, some new capacity coming on in Asia. The timing and extent of that, we'll see how that plays out. But we're very well-positioned and very pleased with the portfolio we have and are looking forward to benefiting again from our advantages and hopefully, continuing strength and growth in the global economy. If we come back to the tax, the two really big factors, one was the healthcare impact that I mentioned, had an impact on the tax rate both sequentially and year-to-year and the rest of it is just that mix of our businesses, upstream versus downstream, non-U.S. versus U.S. And as you know, that can be very variable quarter to quarter, and that drives those tax rates. And we'll drive them in the future and of course, they're hard to predict given the variability in prices and margins as we watch the business over time. But those are the two main factors for the first quarter change.", "Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse", "So nothing unusual except the healthcare?", "David Rosenthal", "No, nothing unusual. We probably have time for one more question.", "Operator", "And that will be from Robert Kessler with Simmons & Company.", "Robert Kessler - Simmons & Company", "This kind of ties back to an earlier question about upstream profitability per barrel but you saw it at higher operating expenses in the upstream year-on-year of about $380 million. Naturally with higher production of 4.5% year-on-year, you'd expect an aggregate increase in cost there. So I'm curious if you could speak to the kind of unit increase, if any, that occurred between periods?", "David Rosenthal", "Let me just reiterate, when we looked at that $380 million impact on earnings quarter versus quarter, the biggest effect there well over half was the impact of exploration expense and we also had some unfavorable forex in there given what's going on with currency rates. As we look at our unit OpEx, in the first quarter, relative to the fourth quarter of last year, we haven't seen a really big change. In fact, if we look at the first quarter relative to all of last year, we've actually seen a decline in our unit OpEx rates and again, it gets back to, you go a number of quarters where you're starting up and ramping up projects and you're booking at expense before you get the volumes, you get the volumes ramped up and you get the effect of that. The one thing that I would like to highlight as we look at OpEx overall, of course, everybody saw an impact from higher energy prices and unfavorable forex rates and that certainly had an impact on our business. But as we look across the ExxonMobil portfolio of businesses, we were able to achieve about $400 million inefficiency and other cost management savings in the quarter. So both ending upstream, the benefit of the project starting up and in the downstream and Chemical, as well as the impact of our ongoing programs seem to reduce cost there, which in the downstream in particular is important given the margin environment. I'd have to step back and say across the board, we're pleased with our operating expense performance and pleased with our profitability given all the dynamics that we found in the market.", "Robert Kessler - Simmons & Company", "Do you -- another element that can be quite volatile of course is taxes, other than income? Do you include that opponent in the unit OpEx figures?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, if we look -- there are a number of taxes that we pay and there are some that are included in unit OpEx but I wouldn't have any major impact or anything out of the norm to mention along those lines other than the impact that higher prices have on severance taxes and that sort of thing.", "Operator", "And then I'd like to turn the call back to David Rosenthal for closing comments.", "David Rosenthal", "Thank you. I'd just like to briefly conclude and thank everyone for your time and your excellent questions this morning. Appreciate the opportunity to talk about the business and the strong results that we had in the first quarter. And I look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And that does conclude today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.", "", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call and Webcast. The focus of this call is ExxonMobil's financial and operating results for the fourth quarter of 2010. We will refer to the slides that are available through the investor section of our website.", "Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our customary cautionary statement shown on Slide 2. Moving to slide 3, we have provided an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. The global economy appears to be stabilizing, with signs of modest growth in the United States and Europe and continued strong growth in the developing world, mainly in the Asia-Pacific and Latin American regions. ", "While crude oil prices remain well above the levels of a year ago, natural gas prices have shown only a moderate increase relative to 2009. Downstream, chemical margins have improved relative to 2009. However, some chemical margins have weakened recently as a result of new industry capacity coming online.", "Turning now to the fourth quarter financial results as shown on slide 4, ExxonMobil's fourth quarter 2010 earnings excluding special items were $9.3 billion, an increase of $3.2 billion from the fourth quarter of 2009. Earnings per share for the quarter, excluding special items, were $1.85, up $0.58 from a year ago.", "The corporation distributed more than $7 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $5 billion was distributed to purchase shares. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $5 billion in the first quarter of 2011.", "Cap ex in the fourth quarter was $10.1 billion, up $1.8 billion from the fourth quarter of 2009, primarily due to the addition of XTO. We continue to invest in robust projects through the business cycle to help meet global demand for crude oil, natural gas, and finished products. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 43%. ", "Moving now to the full year results, as shown on slide 5, ExxonMobil's full year 2010 earnings were $30.5 billion, up $11.2 billion from 2009. ExxonMobil's full year 2010 earnings, excluding special items, were also $30.5 billion, up $11 billion from 2009, which included a charge of $140 million for interest related to the Valdez litigation.", "Earnings per share for the year, excluding special items, were $6.22, up $2.21 from 2009. The corporation distributed $19.7 billion to shareholders in 2010 through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $11.2 billion was distributed to purchase shares. ", "Cap ex in 2010 was $32.2 billion, up $5.1 billion from 2009, mainly due to the addition of XTO and continued progress on our world-class project portfolio, including the Kearl Oil Sands project.", "Our cash generation remains very strong, with $51.7 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales. At the end of 2010, our cash balance was $8.5 billion and debt was $15 billion, which reflects the impact of retiring $7.3 billion of XTO debt.", "We will now provide a review of segmented earnings, starting on slide 6. ExxonMobil earnings increased $3.2 billion from the fourth quarter of 2009, with strong results across all business lines. Upstream earnings increased $1.7 billion, while downstream earnings improved by $1.3 billion and chemical earnings grew by $350 million. ", "Corporate and financing expenses were about $450 million during the quarter, up $190 million versus the fourth quarter of 2009, due mainly to financing activities. As shown on slide 7, ExxonMobil earnings increased $1.9 billion from the third quarter of 2010, mainly due to higher earnings in the upstream, partly offset by slightly lower chemical earnings. ", "Looking now at the full year comparison on slide 8, ExxonMobil's full year 2010 earnings excluding special items were $30.5 billion, up $11 billion from 2009, reflecting strong results in each of our businesses. Upstream earnings increased $7 billion while downstream and chemical earnings were up $1.8 billion and $2.6 billion respectively.", "Corporate and financing expenses, excluding special items, for the full year in 2010, were $2.1 billion, up $340 million from 2009, due mainly to a charge related to the U.S. healthcare legislation and financing activities. The average quarterly corporate and financing expense in 2010 was $530 million, consistent with our continued guidance of $500 million to $700 million per quarter.", "Moving next to the upstream results, and beginning on slide 9, ExxonMobil continues to make excellent progress on its global portfolio of high quality liquids projects. Our recent startup at Odoptu performed extremely well during the quarter, averaging more than 50,000 barrels per day of liquids production. ", "We also recently set a new world record for extended reach drilling on the Odoptu OP-11 well. Employing ExxonMobil's proprietary drilling capabilities, this well reached a total measured depth of 12,345 meters, or over 7.5 miles, with a horizontal reach of 11,475 meters, and was completed in only 60 days. ", "In addition, we sanctioned the Arkutun-Dagi project. This project will be developed via a new concrete gravity based structure, which will be located 25 km offshore and will be tied into the existing onshore processing facility. The development will require approximately 45 wells, and is anticipated to have peak production of 90,000 barrels per day gross. Startup of the Arkutun-Dagi project is anticipated in 2014.", "In Iraq, we have awarded contracts for drilling, well workovers, maintenance services, and early project activity. Our production is ramping up as a result of production optimization, well work, and facility tie-ins. There is currently one drilling rig operating and mobilization of additional rigs is progressing. We are also working with the South oil company to form a new field operating division, which will manage the planning, surveillance, and day-to-day activities of petroleum operations in the field. ", "In Canada, ExxonMobil continues to make strong progress at our Kearl Oil Sands project, which is on schedule for a year-end 2012 startup. ", "Turning now to our gas portfolio, on slide 10, in Papua New Guinea, project execution is underway, including infrastructure development. Contractors for the major worksites have been mobilized, and we are currently commencing pipe lay operations. The pipeline will be approximately 450 miles long, including both the onshore and offshore sections. The pipeline route traverses some extremely challenging terrain on its path from the Southern Highlands to the LNG facility located near Port Moresby. ", "Earlier this month, we signed a joint venture agreement with Qatar Petroleum to progress the Barzan project. This project is expected to supply 1.4 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas, beginning in 2014. The Barzan project will be located in Ras Laffan Industrial City, and will be operated by RasGas Company Limited. The project will produce and process gas from Qatar's North Field, supplying natural gas to local industry in Qatar, and associated hydrocarbon liquids to local and international markets.", "During the quarter, ExxonMobil announced the completion of an expansion to the carbon dioxide capture plant at our La Barge facility in Wyoming. The expansion has increased the amount of CO2 captured by the plant for third party use by 50%. On any one day, the facility is now capable of capturing a CO2 volume equivalent to the emissions of more than 1.5 million cars.", "Turning now to our North American unconventional portfolio, on slide 11, we have approximately 70 rigs working across the United States unconventional plays. These rigs are selectively deployed to the highest-priority locations from our large drilling inventory of over 20,000 wells. For example, in the Fayetteville, strong drilling results have doubled gross operated production between the beginning and end of 2010. In the Haynesville, gross operated production has quadrupled over the same period.", "During the quarter, we acquired Petrohawk Energy's Fayetteville shale assets, which include 150,000 net acres and 95 million cubic feet per day of net production. This represents an attractive addition to XTO's existing position in the Fayetteville play, which now comprises approximately 550,000 net acres. In the Haynesville, we are progressing our joint venture with EnCana across our 108,000-gross acre joint venture area.", "In both the EnCana joint venture and legacy XTO acreage, we are also drilling and testing the prospective Bossier reservoir in selected wells. We also continue to increase activity in our liquids-rich opportunities in the Eagle Ford and Bakken plays. During 2010, we drilled 15 wells in the Eagle Ford, with 5 wells drilled in the fourth quarter. In the Bakken, we drilled an additional 19 wells during the fourth quarter, bringing the total wells drilled in 2010 to 63.", "We are also continuing to expand our acreage position in other key North American unconventional plays. For example, in Canada, we added approximately 18,000 net acres adjacent to our core area at Horn River. ", "Turning now to unconventional activities outside of North America, on slide 12, we are actively evaluating our captured, unconventional opportunities in Europe, Indonesia, and Argentina, while also continuing to pursue other global opportunities. ", "In Germany, we completed drilling our first coal bed methane well in the lower Saxony area. In mid-November, we moved the drilling rig to a second location, which is also targeting coal bed methane. The data recovered from these and other planned wells will be used to assess the coal bed methane resource potential in the region.", "In Indonesia, we hold prospective coal bed methane acreage in the Barito Basin totaling approximately 290,000 net acres. We plan to conduct pilot tests to evaluate the viability of Indonesian coal bed methane as a gas resource and expect to initiate exploration drilling in February of this year.", "In Argentina, ExxonMobil and YPF acquired 2 blocks in the third Neuquen tender round covering approximately 48,000 net acres. In 2010, we captured a total of 132,000 acres in the Neuquen basin and look forward to the opportunity to work with our partner to evaluate the potential of this acreage to produce unconventional natural gas.", "Next, I would like to give you an exploration update on slide 13. Starting with our active program in the Gulf of Mexico, evaluation of the Hadrian North oil discovery is ongoing, and we plan to drill the Hadrian-5 well as soon as the permits are granted by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. We have submitted all the required permit applications.", "The Deepwater Champion drill ship is currently being mobilized to Turkey and is on track to arrive in the March-April timeframe. We will utilize the Deepwater Champion for our drilling campaign in the Black Sea, which will include wells in both Turkey and Romania. We have also recently entered into an agreement with Rosneft regarding joint development of oil and gas resources off the Russian coast of the Black Sea.", "We continue to have success in our established exploration program. We drilled a successful well in the Cepu block in Indonesia, and plan to drill another well this year. We also participated in a successful well near the Jansz field offshore Western Australia. This is the fifth gas discovery in this area in which we have participated during the last 18 months.", "Turning now to the upstream financial and operating results, starting on slide 14. Upstream earnings in the fourth quarter were $7.5 billion, up $1.7 billion from the fourth quarter of 2009. Stronger worldwide realizations resulted in an increase in earnings of $1.4 billion, as crude oil realizations increased $10.84 per barrel and gas realizations increased $0.29 per kcf. ", "Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $560 million, driven mainly by project startups in Qatar. Other items, primarily higher operating expenses and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, decreased earnings by $240 million. Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel were $16.37.", "Moving now to slide 15, oil equivalent volumes increased 19% from the fourth quarter of last year, as a result of the addition of XTO and strong project performance in Qatar. ", "Turning now to the sequential comparison, starting on slide 16. Versus the third quarter of 2010, upstream earnings increased by $2 billion, with stronger global realizations resulting in an additional $1.2 billion in earnings as crude oil realizations increased $9.81 per barrel and gas realizations increased $0.71 per kcf. Higher volumes increased earnings by $870 million as a result of higher seasonal gas demand in Europe and strong Qatar project volume performance.", "Moving to slide 17, oil equivalent volumes increased almost 12% from the third quarter of 2010, due primarily to stronger seasonal gas demand in Europe. ", "Turning now to the full-year comparison, and starting on slide 18, upstream earnings were $24.1 billion in 2010, an increase of $7 billion from 2009. Higher global realizations, primarily liquids, led to an increase in earnings of $6.5 billion. Higher volumes, mainly from Qatar projects, added another $1.2 billion to earnings. All other items, including unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and higher operating expenses, decreased earnings by $690 million.", "Moving now to slide 19, volumes grew by 13%, or 515,000 oil equivalent barrels per day compared to 2009. Excluding the addition of XTO, volumes increased a robust 6%, or 250,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, due to strong project performance in Qatar and strong operational results across our global upstream portfolio. For further data on regional volumes, please refer to the press release and IR supplement.", "Moving now to the downstream and starting on slide 20, during the quarter we continued to demonstrate our commitment to maintaining best in class operations. Recently, our Rotterdam refinery in the Netherlands marked two significant milestones. ", "First, the site marked 50 years of operation and second, it achieved four years without a single lost-time incident, sustaining an impressive safety performance trend. The site also continues to achieve industry-leading energy efficiency performance, consistently placing in the first quartile in the Solomon benchmark studies. Rotterdam continues to be an important hub in the global refining and petrochemical industry, and ExxonMobil has contributed to the economic success of this uniquely positioned international port within Europe. ", "As shown on slide 21, our lubricants business was selected as the preferred supplier of engine oil products for Nissan North America. As a result, Nissan and Infinity dealers in the United States will recommend Mobil branded engine oil products for all dealer-based vehicle service and will have access to ExxonMobil sales and marketing support.", "ExxonMobil is a market leader in synthetic oils and our global brands continue to grow in this high-value sector of the market. Technology leadership, supply reliability, and customer trust underpin the commercial success of our brands.", "Turning now to the downstream operating results, starting on slide 22, downstream earnings in the fourth quarter were $1.2 billion, up $1.3 billion from the fourth quarter of 2009. Higher industry refining margins were the main contributor, increasing earnings by more than $1.2 billion. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $10 billion, while other factors improved earnings by $130 million, primarily due to lower operating expenses.", "Moving to slide 23, sequentially, fourth quarter downstream earnings decreased by $10 million. Favorable margin factors increased earnings by $220 million, while volume and mix effects had a positive contribution of $30 million. Other factors decreased earnings by $260 million, including unfavorable foreign exchange effects and higher maintenance activity. ", "The full year comparison for the downstream is shown on slide 24. Downstream full-year 2010 earnings were $3.6 billion, up $1.8 billion from 2009. Higher margins increased earnings by $1.2 billion, reflecting stronger industry refining margins. Volume and mix effects improved earnings by $420 million due to positive mix effects and benefits from our refining optimization activities. Other effects increased earnings a total of $210 million, mainly due to lower operating expense. ", "Turning now to our chemical business and starting on slide 25, ExxonMobil Chemical completed two projects in the fourth quarter of 2010 that support the demand growth of butyl polymers, one of our key specialty businesses. ExxonMobil Chemical has a long history of developing premium butyl polymers used in tire inner liners that help keep tires properly inflated. Our products add value through enhanced performance in areas such as energy efficiency, longer product life, and greenhouse gas emission reduction. ", "In Kawasaki Japan, our joint venture, Japan Butyl Company, has implemented new proprietary process technology. A conventional butyl reaction occurs at cryogenic temperatures, but ExxonMobil has developed new technology that allows the reaction to occur at warmer temperatures, saving significant energy and capital investment.", "In November, this new technology was awarded the Thomas Alva Edison Patent Award in recognition of its innovation. Leveraging this new technology, the Kawasaki site capacity was increased by more than 20%. During a planned fourth-quarter 2010 downtime at our butyl plant in Fawley, in the UK, we upgraded critical equipment to help ensure reliable supply to our customers. The completion of these two projects in Japan and the UK demonstrate ExxonMobil's commitment to help meet the growing demand for butyl rubber.", "In addition to the butyl projects, we initiated a 10% capacity expansion at one of our flagship hydrocarbon fluids plants located in Antwerp, Belgium. This expansion will strengthen our supply reliability of high performance fluids used in applications such as water treatment, and is expected to be completed later this year.", "We also continue to progress one of the largest projects ever executed by ExxonMobil with the world-scale expansion of our chemical site in Singapore. These projects demonstrate our commitment to support growing chemical customer demand while leveraging our advantaged fee stock, products, and technology.", "Turning now to the chemical operating results, starting on slide 26, fourth quarter chemical earnings were $1.1 billion, up $350 million from the fourth quarter of 2009. Improved margins across our portfolio of commodity and specialty products added $380 million while volume and mix and other effects decreased earnings by $30 million.", "Moving to slide 27, sequentially, fourth quarter chemical earnings decreased by $160 million. Margin effects decreased earnings by $110 million, primarily reflecting higher feed stock costs. Volume and mix effects reduced earnings by $30 million, driven by seasonally lower volumes. Other effects decreased earnings $20 million.", "On slide 28, we show the full year comparison for chemical results. 2010 earnings were a record $4.9 billion, more than double 2009. Substantially stronger margin increased earnings by $2 billion, while volume and mix effects added $380 million. Other effects improved earnings by $200 million, primarily due to the absence of hurricane costs from 2009.", "Overall, the financial and operating results achieved in 2010 were a clear demonstration of the competitive strengths of our chemical company. As chemical demand began to recover from the economic downturn, we leveraged our advantaged feed stock, reliable operations, and unique product portfolio to deliver these record results.", "Moving to slide 29, while we manage our downstream and chemical businesses separately, we continue to capture benefits from the unique integration and optimization of these businesses. Both businesses delivered strong results in 2010, with combined earnings of $8.5 billion, up $4.4 billion from 2009, reflecting our competitive advantages and the strength of our business model.", "Moving to slide 30, ExxonMobil's fourth quarter and full year financial and operating performances were strong, and reflect the ability of our business model and competitive advantages to deliver superior results. We maintain a continuous focus on operational excellence and improving upon our industry-leading safety performance.

As we continue to deploy high-impact technologies and leverage our unparalleled global integration, ExxonMobil remains well-positioned to maximize shareholder value. ", "Finally, I would like to mention two upcoming events. First, in mid-February, we will be releasing our 2010 reserves performance data. Second, as many of you will already have seen, our analyst meeting this year will take place at the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, March 9. This will include a live audio webcast beginning at 9 am Eastern, 8 am Central time. ExxonMobil's presenters will be led by chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson. ", "That concludes my prepared remarks. I would now be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions.] And our first question comes from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse ", "Great results this morning. I guess just maybe thinking about the XTO. We're a few months more into it. What is surprising you? And particularly on the liquids side, if you could give us some details on, say, current production in the back and in Eagle Ford and the potential medium-term outlook for your liquids production elsewhere across the lower 48 portfolio?", "David Rosenthal", "First of all, thank you for your initial comment. As you would guess, we are very pleased with how the results turned out in the fourth quarter, and of course the full year 2010. In addition to the financial operating results that I mentioned, I would like to point out that once again we had an excellent year in the areas that really underpin our strong financial and operating results. We had record safety performance, we continued our overall focus on risk management and environmental performance, and generally across the portfolio had a very good year.", "If we look specifically at XTO, I don't know if I'd call it a surprise, but I can tell you that the integration has gone very, very well. We are very pleased with the way the organizations have come together and been able to seamlessly integrate all the strengths that XTO brought to the merger in addition to being able to quickly utilize some of the technology advantages that ExxonMobil had in order to begin to deliver the type of results that we were expecting in terms of improving production as well as lowering op ex. Attrition has remained low. Activity has increased over the year as you've seen, and as I've mentioned in my script. ", "We have had a number of increases in the areas that I mentioned in my text with the 70 rigs we have running, and there has been some particular focus and making sure we have equipment in the highest priority wells, in particular in the Bakken and Eagle Ford. So all in all, we are very pleased with the integration and how things are going, and I'll also tell you that we will discuss XTO and the integration at length in our analyst meeting in March and we look forward to your participation in that.", "Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse ", "And then maybe one follow-on. Specifically, just in the cash flow in Q4. Can you just say what the working capital contribution was to that $13 billion? And obviously your cap ex was up to $10 billion in 4Q. Normally you do spend a lot more money in Q4, but what should we expect in terms of, with the project sanctions, cap ex for 2011?", "David Rosenthal", "Let's talk about the cash flow first, and then take a look at cap ex. If we look at our cash flow from operations, fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the same quarter last year, of course it's really driven by the higher earnings that we saw and the depreciation and $1.3 billion in asset sales. And that really makes up the bulk of it. The working capital effects were basically negligible, very little. If we look at cap ex in the fourth quarter, it was a strong quarter, fairly typical of what we see in the fourth quarter of most years. We generally see a little higher activity including, of course, partner billings and that sort of thing. But really reflects the ongoing spending in our projects and we'll give you an update for the full year at the March analyst meeting, but it would not be appropriate to take the fourth quarter rate and multiply that by four for 2011. And again, we will give you a fulsome update of our cap ex outlook in March.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I've just got a couple of things. On the [Barzan] project, can you just talk a little bit about how does that compare to what you already have in Qatar? Are these locally priced contracts? And if you could give an idea what the condensate yield would be so we can kind of figure out what that means for the company in 2014? And I have a followup.", "David Rosenthal", "That gas will be priced into the local market and as you would expect that price is certainly going to be less than what LNG trades for on a global basis, but then the investment to produce and deliver that gas, of course, is less. As far as what the condensate yield is going to be, I don't think it's going to be way different than other projects, but it's really too early for me to quote an exact number on that.", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "My followup's more of a housekeeping question on the results. Obviously you had, I think you said $1.3 billion on your previous commentary, I thought it was $1.7 in the release of asset sales on cash flow? Anyway, nevertheless, what I'm looking for is what is the actual contribution to net income from gains on asset sales on foreign exchange, just to give us an idea of what the actual underlying [inaudible] number was. And if possible, I know you might be reluctant to do this, but can you give us an idea of what the contribution was from XTO in the quarter? That would be great.", "David Rosenthal", "Let me first of all hit the absolute asset sales cash generation, just so that we're all clear on that. The absolute value of asset sales in the fourth quarter was $1.7 billion, and that was an increase from the same quarter last year of about $1.3 billion. If you look at total asset sales across the company, in the fourth quarter, the earnings impact of those things compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, was minimal, around $200 million. We have an ongoing program, as you know, but there was really nothing substantial in the fourth quarter in total different from the prior-year's quarter.", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "So the proceeds in the fourth quarter, the $1.7 billion, that was from pre-[inaudible] sales, and that just happened to complete in the fourth quarter? Is that how I should think about it?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes. That's from the sales that closed in the fourth quarter, and for example would not include the Canada sale that we announced but hasn't closed yet.", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Would you care to give us the XTO contribution?", "David Rosenthal", "The XTO earnings contribution, or the XTO cash flow contribution?", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Earnings contribution if you have it.", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, as you'll see in the 10-K that we'll publish, the fourth quarter total earnings were $120 million, and for the full year about $259 million.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "I hope you won't count this as a question, but could you just give us the volumes associated with XTO as well, and I guess just make sure whether that includes the Fayetteville stuff that you bought?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure, are you interested in the full year or the fourth quarter in particular?", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Just the comparables for what you just told Doug on earnings.", "David Rosenthal", "The total volumes on an OEB basis were about 520, and in the third quarter they were about 498, so we're up quarter-on-quarter. And that includes a minimal bit from the acquisitions, but it's really all XTO.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "And then if I could have just a couple more on volumes. First on Iraq, I've read that you're producing about 255,000 barrels a day at West Qurna and if I remember rightly your base production [inaudible] is 244. You want to get to 268 to get to 10% above your base level and hit commercial production. Can you confirm that I'm firstly right on the 255, and secondly, give us an estimate of how long it will take you to hit that 268?", "David Rosenthal", "You're correct on your numbers by and large, and we would expect to hit that 268 by the end of the first half of this year.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "And then how much would you expect the total full-year contribution to be? How much more growth do you think you'll get in '11 over '10?", "David Rosenthal", "Oh I don't know, Paul. I don't have that number. It may be a little too early to tell until we can see where we are at the end of the first half and achieve what we're trying to do there. But I will tell you, as I mentioned, we're on track. Plans are progressing well, and I'll tell you we're very pleased with how things are going and we're looking forward to continuing on the plan we are, mobilizing the rigs that we've got contracted out, and really just continuing the progress that we've been making.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "Is there anything to add on the water? I think it's called the common sea water supply facility?", "David Rosenthal", "As we mentioned, I think in the past, we're leading that concept selection study and of course what we're trying to do is really provide the sea water that's needed to all the southern Iraqi oil fields for the pressure there. We're currently evaluating the study results, and thinking about what the best way is to proceed, what that timeline might be, and how to go about doing it. But I don't have anything more specific than that today. We're still really looking at it and trying to understand what's in front of us and how we go about working on it.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "And then if I could have just a final one on volume it would Qatar. I was just wondering what your exit rate was relative to your, I guess, nameplate capacity there, and how much, therefore, growth we could expect to see delivering in 2011 again? And that will be my last one.", "David Rosenthal", "Sure. If I step back I'll say in general all of the facilities that we have started up in Qatar exited the year at capacity. I'll tell you, the run rates and the uptime have just been phenomenal since those projects started up and so we exited the year basically you can think about it as being at full capacity and therefore in terms of a run rate I think we're pretty much spot on.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank", "And therefore the capacity will stay approximately the same in 2011?", "David Rosenthal", "I think by and large you would expect it to be generally about the same. Might be up just a little bit, but I think generally about the same.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jason Gammel with Macquarie. Your line is open.", "Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research", "I want to ask a couple of questions on your unconventional natural gas portfolio, starting with the Horn River. My understanding is that other operators in the Horn River area have reported reasonably high levels of CO2 and H2S in the gas stream and that's kind of slowed down their drilling this particular winter campaign. Can you talk about the gas quality that you're encountering, and then also confirm when you would expect significant pipeline capacity would be in place to allow you to actually move those volumes to market?", "David Rosenthal", "As you know, Horn River is a key focus area in our global unconventional portfolio, in particular in North America. We do have continued active drilling underway in our wells. We're testing those, both our wells as well as wells we have in a joint venture. I'll tell you those wells are performing well and they successfully verified the presence of multiple productive reservoir areas on our lease holds. Without giving totals, we're seeing average test rates of anywhere from a 0.5 to 1.5 million cubic feet a day from a single frak, so we're happy with that. In terms of your question on CO2 and H2S, I'll tell you while we're continuing our evaluation on that, I really don't have any information and couldn't comment on that specific question.", "Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research", "Okay, that's fine. And just a quick followup before I ask my second question, that's per-frak stage you're getting 0.5 to 1.5, and you would theoretically be looking at something on the order of 10-12 frak stages there?", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah, that would be about right, maybe a little bit more than that.", "Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research", "And the second question, I believe one of your executives was quoted as saying that [inaudible] in Westfalia would have about 2,100 billion cubic meters of gas potential. I appreciate that you talked about drilling a couple of CBM wells in Germany over the course of the quarter, but given that type of a resource phase when would you expect to really start ramping up drilling activity and putting 10-15-20 rigs into the field?", "David Rosenthal", "Well, as we come off of what's been a very successful 2009 and 2010 program, whereas we talked about before we've been testing wells both in the shale plays as well as in now in the coal bed methane, and those are going very well. As we look into 2011 we are going to be continuing with our drilling program, again both CBM and shale gas. We are still evaluating the wells that we have been drilling, and we're in the early evaluation stages. You know, it's kind of like the U.S. unconventional of several years ago. What I can tell you is we did drill our first two coal bed methane wells last year. We're taking a look at those and then we'll really be determining what the exact drilling plan is going into this year. But we would expect that to ramp up a little bit and in fact we're getting ready to spud a well on the western side of the lower Saxony acreage here in the first quarter. So progressing right along, kind of what you'd expect in an evaluation stage of a very large resource potential, and hopefully as the year progresses and we have more well results we'll be able to give a little more, better outlook on what to expect in terms of timing and activity.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Mark Gilman with The Benchmark Company. Your line is open.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "First, on the Barzan project, I guess there's maybe a little bit of confusion with respect to your working interest in the project. Your F&O from last year says 10%. I've seen references to 7% in the trades. Could you clarify what that is and my assumption that it's a production sharing contract. Is that accurate? And then I also have a followup.", "David Rosenthal", "Sure, let me start with the first part on our working interest. I can confirm that it is 7%. As we go forward with the project, in terms of what type of fiscal arrangement we have, we're still finalizing those agreements and I really don't have any comments in terms of other specificity at this point.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company", "My followup relates in general to Iraq and how you're accounting for it both in terms of production as well as earnings, and I was hoping you might be able to tie your response in that regard to what looks to me to be an unusual price-spend variance. On slide 17 in your presentation, where price-spend factors versus the third quarter increased volumes by 39,000 a day, if I'm interpreting it correctly. Is there an Iraq element to this? Or exactly what's driving that?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure Mark, I'd be happy to hit both of those. Let me start with the second one first. If we're looking at sequential volumes between the fourth quarter and the third quarter, the price and spend impact you saw there of 39,000 barrels a day. That was really generally attributable to much higher activity across a number of countries. We saw a much higher level of spending and again, just across West Africa and a number of other places, but nothing out of the ordinary. ", "If we back up and talk about your Iraq question, we have not booked any significant production or earnings or any of that sort of stuff yet this year. Obviously that will come on later in the year when we hit our improved production target and then as that progresses, we'll be able to get more information on that. But I can tell you in 2010 there just wasn't anything to talk about.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclay's Capital. Your line is open.", "Paul Cheng - Barclay's Capital", "Talking about Iraq, given that you're sort of the service contract, from an accounting standpoint are you guys going to be able to book reserves related to Iraq? [How are you going to attribute it?]", "David Rosenthal", "I think as I mentioned before, and would still say today, we do have an expectation that we'll be able to book reserves associated with our Iraq business.", "Paul Cheng - Barclay's Capital", "So should we assume that you did book reserves related to Iraq in 2010?", "David Rosenthal", "We'll be giving an update on our reserves performance here in a couple of weeks and I really wouldn't want to get out ahead of that release on either in total or in any specific country.", "Paul Cheng - Barclay's Capital", "Okay, that's fine. On XTO, you're saying the total production in the fourth quarter is 520,000 [inaudible] per day? Can you break out for us what is between the liquids and the gas side?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure, liquids production was 87 kbd, and then gas production was about 2.6 ncfd.", "Paul Cheng - Barclay's Capital", "And that $120 million, the net income, are you talking about for [inaudible] net of hedging? Or before hedging I should say.", "David Rosenthal", "Yes. Let's remember the discussion we had last quarter. There's some hedging that goes into earnings, and some that just goes into cash flow. And as you'll see, if I break the $120 million up, it's about $84 million associated with the derivative impact in earnings and about $36 million in the base.", "Paul Cheng - Barclay's Capital", "The $120 million is the net income you reported, right?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes. In our earnings. Yes.", "Paul Cheng - Barclay's Capital", "Right. And what's the $84 then? The mark-to-market loss or this is the realized hedging gain that you referred to?", "David Rosenthal", "No. If you think about when we completed the acquisition and we had the mark-to-market all of the hedges at the time, what flows to earnings after that - of course the original booking is based on the [inaudible] - what flows to earnings after that is gains that you make on those hedges as gas prices drop. And so it's that piece that then flows to earnings, and we saw that in the third quarter and then again on the fourth quarter.", "Paul Cheng - Barclay's Capital", "So if I look at it without hedging, the impact [inaudible], then the earnings is $36 million only?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, that would be the answer for the fourth quarter.", "Paul Cheng - Barclay's Capital", "And a final one from me, any update for Poland?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure, I'd be happy to give you an update where we are in Poland. As you know, we have a lot of acreage there and we've been analyzing that, running seismic and doing things really to get ready for a drilling campaign. We do expect as we head into this year we're going to have a couple of wells. In fact, we spud our first well in December, and we would expect to have a couple of those completed this year and really give us an opportunity to just get an early look at that. But I stress an early look, because we're just at the beginning stages of evaluating what we have in Poland. But as part of our global unconventional resource portfolio this is certainly one we're excited to move forward and get the evaluation of that resource under way.", "Paul Cheng - Barclay's Capital", "Do you have a total number of wells you target in Poland for this year?", "David Rosenthal", "The total number of wells as we look across 2011, I don't have a total outlook for you other than I know we're going to drill the first two. We'll see how those go, what we learn, and then later on in the year we can probably give you a full year outlook.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Faisel Khan with Citi. Your line is open.", "Faisel Khan - Citi ", "Just had a question on the accounting side. Your effective tax rate dropped sequentially from the third quarter of '10 to the fourth quarter of '10. I was wondering how much of that is the function of the mix of earnings coming from I guess lower tax jurisdictions versus kind of end of the year effects?", "David Rosenthal", "You know, that's an excellent question, and I can tell you it's basically all due to just the mix of both the businesses, between the upstream, downstream, and chemical, as well as the mix in geographies. But that's really it in a nutshell.", "Faisel Khan - Citi ", "Okay, understood. And then on the U.S. chemical side, it looks like prime product sales dropped pretty precipitously the third quarter of '10 to the fourth quarter of '10? I'm just wondering what's driving that large drop off in sales?", "David Rosenthal", "It's really the impact of a major turnaround we have going on at Beaumont.", "Faisel Khan - Citi ", "Okay. Would you say that had a major impact on the earnings number for the quarter?", "David Rosenthal", "It didn't have a major impact. It's part of the volume effect, but the biggest impact we saw quarter-on-quarter was the rapid rise in feed stock cost that really outpaced price increases as we went through the quarter.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil. Your line is open.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil ", "Question for you on Brazil. I was hoping maybe you could give us a status update - A) if you could confirm the recent dry hole there and then B) elaborate on any future plans?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure, let me step back just a second and give you an update kind of in general on Brazil. The well that we completed in the fourth quarter, the Sabia well, did encounter non-commercial quantities of hydrocarbons, so it was expensed in the fourth quarter. As we look across the block, we are continuing to analyze data from all three wells that we drilled in the block. As you would guess, a block that size and those three wells and different locations and complexities, there's a lot to look at and analyze with our co-venturers. But we're going to take some time, review all of that information, and then determine the next steps for our evaluation plan for the block. So we've got a lot of information, and there's a lot of analysis to do, and as we progress what we're going to do next, we'll provide that update in subsequent quarters.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil ", "And my second question was on the Gulf of Mexico. I'm just curious if you have any experience to date with permitting, what the status is on the well containment system, and if that's being embraced by the BOEM?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure, let me start first with the drilling. The most important well we have is the Hadrian-5 well. You might recall that was an appraisal well on our oil discovery up in Keathley Canyon. We were just about to commence operations when the moratorium started. I can tell you that a revised permit application has been submitted to the BOEM and we're waiting on their approval. We feel like we've submitted all the information that's required and we are anxiously awaiting those permits to be approved so that we can get after that well. ", "When we talk about the marine well containment system, we continue to make really good progress on the overall, the larger project that we talked about. We also have work continuing on the interim and expanded containment systems that we can have available literally very soon. I think the interim system, everybody can look forward to that being available here very quickly, and then the larger one that we've talked about before a little later on. So good progress being made there, and we look forward to getting both of those done and getting on with drilling.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Doug Terreson from ISI Group. Your line is open.", "Doug Terreson - ISI Group", "I had a question, first of all about ENP. In Indonesia, the Natuna gas seems to be making some progress and obviously this could be significant for you guys at some point. And so I just wanted to see if you'd comment on the next steps for 2011 for that project, and also whether it's likely to be pipeline gas, or LNG, or whether it's too early to know", "David Rosenthal", "Sure. If you look broadly in Indonesia, of course this was a big year for us with the progress we're making in Cepu, the wells that we successfully drilled here last year. So that's progressing. You did note Natuna. Yes, there has been progress in there. In December we signed a heads of agreement with Pertamina, and that's going to provide us a framework for negotiation of a new production sharing agreement with the government, and we look forward to progressing those discussions and getting mutually agreeable [terms] for development sometime later this year. So we would expect that to progress further. Now, as we look at Natuna in terms of the ultimate disposition of the gas, or how we're going to get that gas to market, obviously as you would guess we're looking at how we're going to maximize the value of that resource, but I'll tell you, it's too early to comment which way we're leaning, okay?", "Doug Terreson - ISI Group", "I see. And also, chemicals results were great, and so my question is do you have the annual earnings breakdown yet between the specialty and the commodity businesses?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure, I have that, but I will say to start off with, when you look at our chemical earnings we saw tremendous strength in both the commodity and the specialty business. The commodity business did exactly what you would expect when you have an ability to leverage your feed stock advantage. And then the specialty business, we saw nice volume increases in there, and with the margins that we have. And then if we look at the full year basis for those I think the commodity piece of that was the bulk of the year. Certainly the bulk of the year to year increase, I can tell you that. I don't have the absolute values here in front of me, but it drove the bulk of the year to year change.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your line is open.", "Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James ", "First on PNG LNG, we've seen a lot of comments about cost escalations, labor shortages in Australia, and of course recognizing that it's not quite the same scenario in PNG, I was wondering if you have any comments on how that might be affecting your PNG project.", "David Rosenthal", "Sure, I'd be happy to give you an update on the PNG project. It is underway, as I mentioned in my script. We've got infrastructure development underway. We've got a lot of work going on with our contractors. It is progressing right along. But I would tell you that we really haven't seen any impact on the PNG project from the items you noted. We're on track for a 2014 startup. Security, of course, is a very big focus area for us, and I know occasionally in the press you read about security items, but those are being managed with a very comprehensive risk management program in country. So like any project - large, complicated project - there are things that happen from time to time, but nothing out of the ordinary and we remain on track to start up that project on schedule.", "Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James ", "And then just a quick followup on Hadrian-5, once you get the permit, if and when that happens, what kind of completion time do you guys expect?", "David Rosenthal", "I don't know exactly how long the completion time is expected. I do know that once we get the permit, we're going to be able to get after it and get the well underway. And I would expect it would be typical of any Gulf of Mexico well in that depth of water, but nothing out of the ordinary.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from John Herrlin with Societe Generale. Your line is open.", "John Herrlin - Societe Generale", "Thank you. Three quick ones. David, you mentioned unconventional activities both in North American and abroad. Could you give us a sense of what spending will be like on unconventional in 2011 versus 2010?", "David Rosenthal", "I don't have an outlook for you yet for 2011. We will talk about that, of course, as part of our cap ex outlook in the analyst meeting in March. So I just have to ask for you to wait until then and we're going to give a pretty fulsome outlook on that business. It will be an active year, but the actual cap ex we'll have to give you in a few weeks.", "John Herrlin - Societe Generale", "Okay. Next one: With XTO, could you give us a sense of what kind of completion optimization success that you've had? Were you able to increase drilling times, reduce frak costs, that sort of thing?", "David Rosenthal", "I can tell you - of course it's still early, we're only 6 months into this - we have been able to take some ExxonMobil technology and apply it to some of the wells that are being drilled and do some crossover of that. We have seen some success in that regard, but again the specifics of which I think we'll save for, again, a more fulsome discussion at the analyst meeting in March. We'll talk a lot about the integration and the progress we're making. But rest assured, we are transferring technology. We are transferring best practices back and forth, and again, we'll talk more about that in March.", "John Herrlin - Societe Generale", "Okay. And last one from me, David. What were your net capitalized costs at the end of the year - upstream?", "David Rosenthal", "If you're talking about the total capital deployed in the business?", "John Herrlin - Societe Generale", "Well no, your net capitalized cost. Like in 2009 it was about $85 billion. I was wondering where you ended up last year.", "David Rosenthal", "We don't have the segmentation yet for the businesses.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Ian Reid from Jeffries. Your line is open.", "Ian Reid - Jeffries", "Would you mind if I asked you a question about your energy outlook?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure, that would be just fine.", "Ian Reid - Jeffries", "What's obvious from that is your more bullish view of natural gas demand versus coal compared to other commentators. I'm wondering if you could just characterize Exxon's view of natural gas versus coal, how it differs to other people, and what's kind of driving the numbers you're coming up with here?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure. Well, of course, the primary growth in the usage of natural gas is going to be in power generation, and I think if you've seen our energy outlook you see the growth in that. One of the fundamental reasons for the numbers that we've tabled, of course, is an assumption on cost of carbon, however form that might come, would certainly drive some conversion of coal to gas. I think one of the other things that we have out there as you see the economy ramp up and as you see the demand for power generation to ramp up, certainly the source of electricity generation that can be brought on the quickest, particularly here in the U.S., is fueled by natural gas. So if you're looking short-term increased industrial demand, increased need for power generation and electricity, and then longer term as we go out and look at the dynamics, the assumption that there will be some cost of carbon included. And as you know, natural gas has 60% less GHG emissions than a typical coal fired plant does, so you'll have an inherent competitive advantage.", "Ian Reid - Jeffries", "Okay. Thanks for that. Can I ask a question on the results? In European gas, are you seeing further pressures from your customers for your oil linked gas to try and renegotiate the contracts to try and reduce the oil linkage and to focus that more on spot?", "David Rosenthal", "Certainly if you look at the European gas market this year, it's been a good year, very robust demand, particularly in the fourth quarter. Prices have held up well, and it's been a good market. I tell you, I wouldn't want to comment on specific commercial discussions or commercial agreements that are underway other than saying that the strategy we've implied in Europe, which is both a supply with indigenously produced gas on the continent as well as the ability to bring cargos of LNG out of Qatar into the UK and into the Adriatic and benefit from a nice strong spot market. All of that business, as we look across the year, particularly in the latter half, has been very successful, but I wouldn't attribute that to any one contract that we have in place, or comment about what's going on with those other than to say diversified portfolio, diversified contract mix, divertible cargoes. That strategy has been very healthy for us this year.", "Ian Reid - Jeffries", "You just mentioned divertible cargoes. Is it possible to say what quantity of diverts you managed in the quarter?", "David Rosenthal", "I don't have a specific number for the quarter. I think if you think about in general, we've said the cargoes coming out of Qatar in total about two-thirds of them run out in long-term contracts and the balance are spot and those are divertible, which is kind of how the big picture looks there. And then again, we've benefited very well for that here in the year.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jacques Rousseau from RBC. Your line is open.", "Jacques Rousseau - RBC Capital Markets ", "Just a quick question on asset sales. I guess in the quarter you said about $1.7 billion of asset sales, which I think was about the same amount as you had sold through the first three quarters. So my question is in prior years you seemed to have sold more in higher commodity price environments. Is that something we should look forward to in the next couple of years, assuming oil and such stays around where it is?", "David Rosenthal", "That's an excellent question. I have to tell you though, the pace of our asset management program is not driven by swings in commodity prices and margins. We have a fairly robust ongoing program, and it's very disciplined in its approach and we don't have any specific targets year by year or business by business. What you do see, though, and have seen very strongly this past year, is a program where - it sounds simple, but if some assets of ours are worth more to others than they are to us, we're happy to sell them. And that's irrespective - you can do that in a low-price or margin environment. You can do that in a high price environment. But it's really just an ongoing disciplined program, and I wouldn't have an outlook for 2011. We'll just progress the year like we did last year, and see what opportunities are presented.", "Operator", "And we have no further questions at this time.", "David Rosenthal", "Great. Well thank you all very much for joining us this morning. We're very pleased, as I said at the outset, with the results that we've generated in the fourth quarter and the full year, and I thank you for your participation this morning and your excellent questions.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings call and webcast. The focus of this call is ExxonMobil's financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2011. I will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. But before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our customary cautionary statement shown on Slide 2.", "Moving to Slide 3. We provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. The global economic recovery remains uncertain as a result of continued sovereign debt concerns, inflationary pressures in major non-OECD markets and the tragic events in Japan. Energy markets are experiencing greater uncertainty with the political unrest in North Africa and the Middle East. These events, along with the effects of the weak U.S. dollar, have resulted in significantly higher crude oil prices. Natural gas prices outside the United States also increased relative to the first quarter of 2010. In addition, refining margins in the United States and the Asia Pacific region improved relative to a weak first quarter 2010 environment for the Downstream. We also saw strong Chemical margins, especially commodity margins in the United States and Europe.", "Turning now to the first quarter financial results as shown on Slide 4. ExxonMobil's first quarter 2011 earnings, excluding special items, were $10.7 billion, an increase of $4.4 billion from the first quarter of 2010. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 47%. Earnings per share for the quarter, excluding special items, were $2.14, up $0.81 from a year ago. ", "The corporation distributed more than $7 billion to shareholders in the first quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $5 billion was distributed to purchase shares. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $5 billion in the second quarter of 2011. CapEx in the first quarter was $7.8 billion, up over $900 million from the first quarter of 2010, reflecting the increase in our U.S. unconventional activities.", "Across our diverse portfolio, we continue to invest in robust projects through the business cycle to help meet global demand for crude oil, natural gas and finished products. Our cash generation remains very strong with $18.2 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales. At the end of the first quarter of 2011, our cash balance was $13.2 billion and debt was $15.9 billion. ", "The next slide provides additional detail on first quarter sources and uses of cash. Over the quarter, our cash balance grew from $8.5 billion to $13.2 billion. The combined impact of strong earnings, depreciation expense, lower working capital and the benefit of our ongoing asset management program yielded $18.2 billion of cash flow from operations. Uses of cash included additions to plant, property and equipment or PP&E of $7.1 billion and shareholder distributions of $7.2 billion. ", "We will now provide a review of segmented results starting on Slide 6. ExxonMobil's first quarter 2011 earnings of $10.7 billion increased $4.4 billion or 69% from the first quarter of 2010 with strong results across all business lines. Upstream earnings increased $2.9 billion, while Downstream earnings improved by $1.1 billion and Chemical earnings grew about $270 million. Corporate and financing expenses of $640 million during the quarter were down $160 million versus the first quarter of 2010 due mainly to the absence of the tax charge related to the U.S. healthcare legislation and remained within our continued guidance of $500 million to $700 million per quarter. ", "As shown on Slide 7, ExxonMobil's first quarter 2011 earnings of $10.7 billion increased $1.4 billion from the fourth quarter of 2010, mainly due to higher earnings in the Upstream and Chemical businesses.", "Moving next to the Upstream results and beginning on Slide 8. ExxonMobil, along with our co-venturers, reached a major production milestone in the redevelopment of the West Qurna 1 oil field in Southern Iraq. We achieved the improved production target under the contract by increasing production 10% above the initial field production rate of 244,000 barrels per day gross. The current field production is now about 320,000 barrels per day gross. Day-to-day operations have been transferred to the West Qurna 1 Field Operating division, which is staffed by personnel from the South Oil Company and ExxonMobil. Operations include drilling new wells, working over existing wells and debottlenecking and optimizing facilities. We currently have 3 drilling rigs operating in the field and expect to add additional rigs during the year.", "Turning now to our exploration and development activities on Slide 9. Beginning with our deepwater activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where ExxonMobil holds 2.1 million net acres, we are currently drilling the Hadrian-5 exploration well, which spud in March, within several days of receiving permit approval from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. Hadrian-5 is a further evaluation of the Hadrian North oil complex. The Hadrian South gas discovery is fully appraised. As you know, we and other members of the Marine Well Containment Company recently announced the readiness of an initial well containment response system. Work is continuing on additional enhancements to expand the system, which will be deployed next year. The Marine Well Containment Company membership continues to grow and now consists of 10 member companies. ", "Finally, building on our strong position in Norway, ExxonMobil was awarded 3 new production licenses as part of the Norwegian continental shelf 21st licensing round. These include one operated production license and 2 nonoperated licenses.", "Moving now to Slide 10. In Indonesia, ExxonMobil made another discovery on the Cepu Block in East Java Province. A Kedung Keris well was drilled to a total depth of 7,032 feet and encountered an oil column of 561 feet in the target carbonate zone. The Kedung Keris discovery is located approximately 9 miles from the Banyu Urip oil discovery, which was made in 2001. The Banyu Urip early production system continues to perform well, and activities are progressing on the future 450 million-barrel oilfield development.", "We are also evaluating our coal bed methane acreage in the onshore Barito Basin, which covers approximately 290,000 net acres. Exploration drilling commenced with the first coal bed methane well in early April, and drilling operations are ongoing.", "Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results and starting on Slide 11. Upstream earnings in the first quarter were $8.7 billion, up $2.9 billion from the first quarter of 2010. Stronger crude oil and natural gas realizations increased earnings by $2.6 billion as crude oil realizations increased over $25 per barrel and gas realizations increased $0.72 per kcf. Production mix and volume effects decreased earnings by $160 million due mainly to the impact of high prices on entitlement volumes, higher downtime and decline, partly offset by the ramp-up of Qatar projects and the addition of XTO. Other items, primarily a gain on the sale of Western Canada assets and the absence of prior year dry holes, increased earnings by $470 million. Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel were $20.", "Moving to Slide 12. Oil-equivalent volumes increased 10.5% from the first quarter of last year, mainly due to growth in our U.S. Unconventional Resource business and the impact of Qatar project ramp-up. Volumes were, however, negatively impacted by higher prices on entitlement volumes, higher downtime, decline and divestments.", "Turning now to the sequential comparison and starting on Slide 13. Versus the fourth quarter of 2010, Upstream earnings increased by $1.2 billion with stronger realizations resulting in an additional $1.3 billion in earnings as crude oil realizations increased over $16 per barrel and global gas realizations increased to $0.79 per kcf. Production mix and volume effects decreased earnings by $520 million due mainly to the impact of higher prices on entitlement volumes, higher downtime and divestments. Other items, primarily asset management activity and lower operating expenses, increased earnings by $410 million. ", "Moving to Slide 14. Oil-equivalent volumes decreased 3% from the fourth quarter of 2010 due mainly to the impact of higher prices on entitlement volumes, downtime and divestments. For further data on regional volumes, please refer to the press release and the IR supplement.", "Moving now to the Downstream and starting on Slide 15. During the quarter, ExxonMobil Lubricants & Specialties renewed the long-standing technology partnership with the Vodafone McLaren Mercedes Formula 1 team. The new multiyear agreement maintains the longest continuous oil company sponsorship of a Grand Prix race team. As part of the agreement, we will continue providing Vodafone McLaren Mercedes with Mobil 1 lubricant technology, expertise and support to develop next-generation lubricants for the race car engine and gearbox. ExxonMobil will continue to leverage learnings from the extreme conditions of Formula 1 racing to further enhance Mobil 1 synthetic oil formulations.", "With this agreement, ExxonMobil will also supply a range of specialized lubricant products for use at the McLaren Technology Center. These products will include high-performance cutting fluids used in the manufacturing of race car components: Mobil SHC synthetic grease for the wind tunnel and Mobil Delvac 1 synthetic diesel engine oil to help reduce fuel consumption and improve emissions of the Vodafone McLaren Mercedes truck fleet.", "Turning now to the Downstream financial and operating results starting on Slide 16. Downstream earnings in the first quarter were $1.1 billion, up $1.1 billion from the first quarter of 2010. Improved industry margins increased earnings by $470 million driven by higher refining margins, partly offset by lower marketing margins. Continued benefits from our refining optimization activities contributed $350 million in volume and mix effects, while other factors improved earnings by $240 million primarily due to favorable foreign exchange effects.", "Moving to Slide 17. Sequentially, first quarter Downstream earnings were essentially flat. Higher industry margins, higher industry refining margins, partly offset by lower marketing margins, increased earnings by $160 million. Volume and mix effects were a negative $270 million primarily due to higher turnaround and maintenance activities. Other factors contributed $60 million.", "Turning now to our Chemical business starting on Slide 18. ExxonMobil Chemical recently announced the grand opening of our world-class Shanghai Technology Center in China. Our investment in this new facility demonstrates the strategic importance of technology and its critical role in supporting the long-term value of our Chemical business. The 220,000 square foot facility is equipped with more than 200 state-of-the-art processing machines and analytical instruments. The center also has 22 development-scale and 16 commercial-scale product processing machines, allowing us to perform full-scale testing to serve our Chemical customer needs in the fast-growing China and broader Asia markets. The Shanghai Technology Center is supported by more than 300 employees from our technology, sales marketing and supply chain groups. ", "Today, the Chinese petrochemical market is the largest in the world. And through 2020, China will represent over 1/3 of global petrochemical demand growth. Shanghai Technology Center is well positioned to support this growth by providing our customers with product and processing solutions and add value to their businesses.", "Turning now to Slide 19. During the quarter, Saudi Basic Industries Corporation or SABIC announced that work on our proposed joint venture elastomers project has moved into the front-end engineering and design phase. As previously announced, plans are to establish a domestic supply of more than 400,000 tons per year of synthetic rubber, thermoplastic specialty polymers and carbon black to serve emerging local and international markets in Asia and the Middle East. ", "ExxonMobil and SABIC are targeting development of a globally competitive project with best-in-class industry cost and have selected Jubail Industrial City as the site for the new manufacturing units in order to expand integration opportunities within the existing KEMYA petrochemical joint venture. The Saudi elastomers project continues a long history of investment in Saudi Arabia and builds on the strong relationship with SABIC to meet the growing customer need for our products.", "Turning now to the Chemical financial and operating results and starting on Slide 20. First quarter Chemical earnings were a record $1.5 billion, up $267 million from the first quarter of 2010, again demonstrating the value of a balanced portfolio of commodity and specialty businesses, world-scale facilities with strong operational performance and technology application to deliver superior feedstock advantage. Higher margins contributed $470 million in earnings, primarily driven by stronger commodity chemicals margins and our feedstock advantage. Other effects decreased earnings by $200 million due to higher plant maintenance costs, unfavorable foreign exchange effects and the absence of asset management gains.", "Moving to Slide 21. Sequentially, first quarter Chemical earnings increased about $450 million. Margin effects increased earnings by $340 million primarily due to stronger global commodity chemicals margins. Other effects increased earnings by $100 million due mainly to lower turnaround and maintenance costs this quarter.", "Moving to Slide 22. While we manage our Downstream and Chemical businesses separately, we continue to capture benefits from the unique integration and optimization of these businesses. Looking at our combined Downstream and Chemical results, first quarter earnings were $2.6 billion, up $1.3 billion from the first quarter of 2010.", "Moving to Slide 23. ExxonMobil's first quarter financial and operating performance was strong and results -- and reflects the ability of our business model and competitive advantages to deliver superior results. We maintain a continuous focus on operational excellence and improving upon our industry-leading safety performance, while continuing with the disciplined execution of our long-term investment plan. As we continue to deploy high-impact technologies and leverage our unparalleled global integration, ExxonMobil remains well positioned to maximize long-term shareholder value.", "That concludes my prepared remarks. And I would now be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Mark Gilman from The Benchmark Company.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "I wonder if you could comment on what you did in the quarter with respect to the tax rate increase in the U.K. Did you accrue at the  higher rate and address that in the context of the overall increase in the effective tax rate, which one might have suspected from a higher price, but E&P earnings were actually a lower percentage than they were in the fourth quarter? I also had a follow-up.", "David Rosenthal", "Sure, Mark. That's a good question given some of the other results that are out there. We did not accrue any impact associated with the increase in taxes in the U.K. that were recently announced. As you probably know, for U.S. GAAP purposes, effective changes in tax laws are reflected only on the enactment date as opposed to IFRS where the effect of these changes are reflected for laws enacted or laws that are substantially enacted or are anticipated to have that kind of an effect. So we will reflect the impact of that in our earnings at the time that it's fully enacted.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "Okay. And in terms of the tax rate itself going up to 47% in the quarter despite the fact that the E&P percentage of income was lower in this quarter than in the fourth quarter?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, if you're looking sequentially -- I guess if you're looking at the increase then from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, where we went from 43% to 47%, the biggest factor in the increase there was some absences of favorable tax items that we had in the fourth quarter, as well as we did see a little change in the mix that added about 1% or so. So we're down quarter-on-quarter and up sequentially.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "Okay. My follow-up relates to Iraq, David, and whether or not you included any production in the quarter from Iraq, and if you could indicate what kind of impact that, that will have in terms of the way you're reporting your financials.", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, sure. If we look at volumes in the first quarter, they were de minimis given the timing that we reached the production target that we were looking for. So we will see increased volumes as we head into the second quarter.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG", "A quick opener. And forgive me if you gave this number, but do you have a net debt number for the end of the quarter?", "David Rosenthal", "Oh, yes. Sure. Net debt at the end of the quarter was right at about $15.9 billion.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG", "And how much of that is cash?", "David Rosenthal", "No, I'm sorry, that's the actual debt.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG", "All right.", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, I'm sorry. The cash balance was $13.2 billion. So the difference in those then is about $2.6 billion, $2.7 billion.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG", "If I could not count as a question and ask you too from here.", "David Rosenthal", "Okay.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG", "Firstly, on CapEx. In the U.S. clearly you've had a big jump in U.S. CapEx year-over-year. You had just over $2 billion of spending. I was wondering, could just talk a little bit more about that number going forward? And I'm thinking just given your comments on the Gulf of Mexico about where that $2 billion breaks down to and where you expect it to go from here.", "David Rosenthal", "Sure. If we look at the CapEx increase quarter-on-quarter in the U.S., that's really all the addition of XTO and the fact that we didn't report CapEx in the first quarter of last year for them and we've got it this year. And that's the bulk of the U.S. increase that you see in the first quarter.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG", "But I would imagine that you had a lower level activity in the Gulf of Mexico, right? And do you expect that to ramp back up going forward?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, I don't have an exact number, but I would assume the activity in the Gulf was a little bit less. And certainly, we'll see that increasing in this quarter as we're drilling the Hadrian well. And that well, as I mentioned, has spudded and is going down. And so yes, we'll see that. So we'll see a little pickup there in the second quarter.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG", "And what about for the XTO stuff? Do you -- I mean, I know you've reached the level of rigs that you've kind of held flat. Is that the expectation, let's say, for the remainder of 2011?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, that's pretty much. I think you'll see us probably be somewhere in that 65 to 70 rigs  quarter-on-quarter rate, which is about flat where we've been. Obviously, as we look at that portfolio, we are optimizing the use of those rigs and making sure that we're obviously hitting the liquids-rich areas to the extent possible and as well as prioritizing our gas rigs and utilization and, of course, utilization of frac-ing crews and other support services and equipment to make sure that we're maximizing the value of that program. But we're very pleased with how things are going in the first quarter. I'm looking forward to a good year.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG", "And then if we just roll that through the combination of the 2 things. You've got the rigs at around the same level. Would do you expect the CapEx for those rigs to remain at around the same level or are you seeing cost increases?", "David Rosenthal", "No, I think that's a reasonable expectation as we're looking across the year. That's consistent with the guidance that we had in the March Analyst Meeting. But as we look across the year, we would expect cost to be generally flat. And that's kind of what we're seeing now here in the first quarter.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG", "Great. And then just -- I hope it's not too long a question, but when I look at your financial and operating information, your refining capacity after 2010 has given that 6.25 million barrels a day. And if I look at your utilization rate in Q1, assuming that's the right number for Q1, 5.18 million of throughput. That's about an 82% utilization rate. If I remember rightly, 2010 was a, well, I can see from the history, was a low year for utilization at 84% with quite a lot of turnarounds. My question is, how come utilization is so low? Is it a Japan effect? Is there some other issue there? And would we expect that to bounce higher for the rest of the year? And I'll leave it there.", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, sure, Paul. That's a good question. We had a couple of factors going on. We did see in the first quarter, particularly relative to the first quarter of last year, some higher turnaround activity in Europe and across Asia. And of course, we did see some impact in Japan related to the tragic events there. I can tell you that all of our facilities in Japan are up and running full bore. We obviously brought those up as quickly as possible in order to help relieve the product supply disruption effects in Japan, and we're very pleased with how that effort is going. Utilization in the U.S. is doing well. So again, other than the planned maintenance and turnaround activities outside of the U.S., things were doing pretty well.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Yes. So David, a couple of questions. I'm trying to understand the production movements in the quarter. Obviously, there's a lot of moving parts here. So maybe, we'll just highlight some of the ones that had jumped out to us. Asia Pacific gas seems to be down a fair bit, and I'm guessing production sharing contracts impacted African oil. But if you could confirm those 2 things and maybe talk a bit about them. But if you could also explain what's going on with liquids in Europe. And then I have a follow-up please.", "David Rosenthal", "If you look broadly across our volumes, we did see some impacts, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, from downtime. And we did see that in the Asia Pacific Gas business. We had some -- we did have some downtime in Qatar, and that affected our gas business there. Liquids, of course you're seeing a big decline relative to the impact of the high prices on entitlements. And as we mentioned in the chart there, you are seeing some impact of divestments, the 2 divestments that we announced, the Gulf of Mexico and Canada, on both liquids and gas. But across the board, large impacts, of course, some PSC entitlement effects, and then the downtime that we had in a number of places. I'll also mention, while we're talking about overall volumes, we did have some downtime across West Africa that lowered our volumes there. And as you know, there was downtime up on the North Slope that affected the Prudhoe Bay volumes. So while we did see that downtime effect in the first quarter, and that's both relative to last year and the fourth quarter this year in particular, all of that production is back online. So we would expect to get those impacts back as well as the earnings in the second quarter.", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Broadly, David, can you quantify the absolute impact of what has come back on stream? Or do you want me to take that offline?", "David Rosenthal", "I don't have that number off the top of my head. So yes, you can -- we'll take that offline.", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay. My follow-up is fairly quick. I think the exploration charges were quite light, it appears, relative to the run rate from last year. Can you -- is that basically a reflection of the success that you've had? Is spending down? Is it seasonal? Or can you give us some idea of what the trend is there please? And I'll leave it there.", "David Rosenthal", "Sure. That one is pretty straightforward. It's just the absence of the dry hole costs that we had last year, in particular Libya and some of the other places that you're aware of. And then the rest is just timing. We have a very large exploration program getting under the way this year. We got the Hadrian well going down now. Turkey will be spudding in the second quarter. So some timing, of course, across the quarters. But the main quarter-on-quarter impact that you see on exploration expense is the absence of the dry hole costs that we booked last year.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Doug Terreson with ISI.", "Doug Terreson - ISI Group Inc.", "So in chemicals, you guys have historically invested when competitive advantages were present rather when you really have cyclical returns, and it's obviously served you well over time. But at the same time, the returns in U.S. Chemicals business are about the highest in the Global portfolio, which suggests that opportunities for value-added investment might be present. So while I don't think that the guys said too much on U.S. Chemical at the Analyst Meeting, I want to see if you'd comment on the level of interest and investment in this business, that is there is any. And if so, in what product areas, given the kind of the surprising strength in this area?", "David Rosenthal", "Doug, as you point out, we do have a long history of investing through the price cycle in the Chemicals business, and that has served us well. And it's, of course, serving us well now, and we would expect it to do the same in the future as we bring the Singapore plant up. When we look in the U.S., we are currently enjoying a terrific feedstock advantage. Basically, as you know, everybody is running,  everything, to the extent that they can into their crackers, and we're taking advantage of that. As we look longer term in the U.S. Chemical business, the first place you got to start is demand and demand growth for the product. And we don't see the demand in the U.S. being near as strong as opportunities that we have elsewhere, particularly the Asia Pacific region and, in particular, serving the markets there and, of course, in the Middle East. So I think the growth prospects for demand pull is definitely outside of the U.S. And then if we look at where we are today, we're happy with our portfolio and the integration that we have with our other refineries. And that, that we've talked about in the past. So while times are real good now and we're taking advantage of them, we're really focusing the bulk of our investment plan and our growth prospects outside of the U.S.", "Doug Terreson - ISI Group Inc.", "Okay, simple enough. And also given the geographical scope of your operations, your information on oil demand trends are usually as good or better than anybody's. And on this point, while most of the rise in oil prices unfolded in the latter part of the first quarter and there are lag effects in many countries, meaning it may be too early to know. I wanted to see if you'd comment on trends in OECD and non-OECD  demand that is if you have updated  information from these regions.", "David Rosenthal", "I don't have any really updated demand relative to the broad things that we talked about in our energy outlook. I think things are pretty consistent with that. As I mentioned, of course we are seeing some inflationary pressures in the developing countries, and the impact that, that might have near term on demand relative to economic growth remains to be seen. But as we look out long term, we expect to see growth consistent with our energy outlook. But no real change.", "Operator", "We'll take the next question from Edward Westlake with Credit Suisse.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And thanks for the cash flow statements in the presentation. Very, very helpful.", "David Rosenthal", "You're welcome, Ed.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Just a quick question on Chemicals in the international markets. I mean, obviously, there are meant to be start-ups coming on this year and, obviously, oil prices have pushed up and then that may impact demand. What is happening, David, because that was a lot of the surprise, the Chemical margins as you start into this quarter or your outlook for the rest of the year?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, as we're looking -- let's start with what we saw in the first quarter, which was very strong margins kind of across the board in particular in commodities in the U.S. and Europe. And, of course, those were levered up by our feedstock flexibility and the advantages we have there. So we had a real strong quarter. Specialties as well given the increase in economic activity in industrial man. so kind of hit on all cylinders there in the first quarter. So as we look into the future, it'll be very difficult for me to predict or speculate on margins going forward. A lot of that is driven by economic activity and what's going on. Margins are firm as we look around what's going on today. But again, given the impact that the economy and changes can have on growth and fairly quickly on prices, I wouldn't want to speculate. But I would say that one of the important things about taking advantage of what you get is to have your operations that are up and running, and we're focusing on that. We have very good high utilizations, and so margins remain strong. But we'll certainly take advantage of it and maximize feed flexibility. But overall prices and demand, so that would be tough for me to look out the window and speculate on that.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And then my follow-up is on this sort of volume-mix shift as we go quarter-to-quarter. Obviously, in Q4, you had $870 million gain versus Q3. And then this quarter, you lost $520 million. And you mentioned PSCs and downtime. Is it right for us to assume that most of that is downtime in terms of that vol. mix kind of impact?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, if you're looking quarter-on-quarter, one of the biggest impacts there is entitlements had a big impact. And again, as I mentioned, downtime was the other. And so what -- and that really hit our liquids. So what you see quarter-on-quarter sequentially is liquid volumes went down because of those effects and gas volumes went up. And we don't -- at current prices, we're not making the same money on the U.S. Gas business as we are on our liquids. So as I mentioned earlier, all of the downtime is back up and running, and we're pleased to have those volumes back. Crude oil prices remain strong. So to the extent that, that continues to have impacts on entitlements, we'll see those going forward. But I think when you look at what we control, it's good to have the downtime behind us and the volumes back online.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And a follow-on from Mark's question. Do you have a number for the U.K. tax charge at this point in terms of the charge you might take in Q3?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, I don't have that number yet. So we'll have that -- obviously, and if that goes through, we'll have that in the second quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Faisel Khan with Citi.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "I'm wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the -- so you talked about the asset management effects of I think about $410 million or so in that same business sequentially. What exactly is -- when you talked about asset management, what does that exactly mean?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure. We've got -- and asset management is only one factor in that $410 million. And you're basically seeing in there the impact of the Western Canada sale that we had in the first quarter of this year. But that was mostly offset by the gain on the sale of the Eastern Gulf of Mexico last quarter. So if we look at that $410 million quarter-to-quarter sequentially, the biggest impact in there is on lower operating expenses. So you have a combination of lower field expense and then, as the question was mentioned earlier, lower exploration expense quarter-on-quarter because of the effects I mentioned. So the big impact in that $410 million sequentially is really lower operating expense.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "Okay, got you. And then one last question. On the Chemical business, if I'm looking at U.S. Chemical prime product sales, and if I go back and look at those volumes kind of over the last few quarters, it looks like you've peaked out at about 2.6 million tons in the third quarter of last year, and you're still kind of operating around this 2.2 million-ton range. Is there something going on with some of the assets that you're selling less product than you did in the third quarter of last year?", "David Rosenthal", "No, there's really nothing going on from an asset perspective. We had a little higher turnaround activity in the fourth quarter. One, in the effects that you see, for example, when you compare our first quarter volumes in '11 compared to the first quarter volumes of last year, we did have an opportunity -- you might recall this time last year I mentioned that a number of our competitors' units were down for various reasons, and we had an opportunity to really pick up some spot sales particularly in the U.S. in the Commodity business and took advantage of that. And so that was being pretty opportunistic. As we look across the quarters kind of balancing things out and taking into account maintenance, timing and that sort of thing, no real change. In fact, I'll tell you, from a utilization standpoint, we're running our facilities at a rate that's above the industry averages that have been announced. Uptime has been great. And I think I said a minute ago, that business is kind of hitting on all cylinders right now, and we're very pleased with the financial results.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "Thanks for the time.", "David Rosenthal", "Sure thing.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated", "Question for you. I know you addressed the asset sales in Western Canada and the Gulf of Mexico. But when you look just in general, the asset divestitures have kind of ticked higher here in the last couple of quarters compared to where we where trending previously. And I'm just curious, is that a sign of increased divestiture activity to come?", "David Rosenthal", "No, I wouldn't read anything into that particularly. As you know, we have a long-standing practice and a long-standing program. I think we mentioned at the March Analyst Meeting that if you go back to the merger, we've divested about $40 billion worth of assets. That's a pretty big program. It's opportunistic. It's ongoing. Obviously, you'll have the timing of certain things. But nothing major, nothing out of the ordinary. Always evaluating opportunities, always talking to folks that are interested in our assets. And as we've said before, someone comes along and places a higher value for whatever reason on an asset than we do, we're certainly going to talk to them about that opportunity. But I wouldn't look at the recent trends as any sign or indicator of increased or lower activity levels to come.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated", "And then one follow-up, if I could, just on the share repurchases. It may not get very far on this, but I'll give it a stab anyway. I guess I was thinking maybe there's a chance that repurchase program would have bumped up a bit heading into 2Q just given the elevated commodity environment and the fact that the cash balance is back up to $13 billion. Would you say there is maybe an upward bias should commodity prices stay where they are here?", "David Rosenthal", "I wouldn't necessarily say there's any bias with respect to the share purchases. We did have very strong cash flows in the first quarter for the reasons I mentioned. That did enable us to really follow the cash strategy that we've talked about many times. We have a very large investment program this year. I hope everybody noticed the announcement yesterday of our fairly sizable dividend increase, So we are pleased to be able to fund that and then have the ability to fund another $5 billion of share repurchases, while at the same time maintaining our strong balance sheet and, most importantly, maintaining financial flexibility. And of course, as we talk about a lot, maintaining discipline in investments and uses of cash throughout the cycle is one of our key objectives, and we continue to manage the business along those lines.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated", "I appreciate it.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Iain Reid with Jefferies.", "Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "I'd like to echo the thanks for the cash flow statements, I'm looking forward to the balance sheet next quarter.", "David Rosenthal", "It will be out shortly.", "Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Yes, yes, I know. Just a couple of questions. Going back to Iraq. The industry gossip is that things are tougher than people expected in Iraq in terms of production buildup. There's a fair amount of infrastructure to be -- and so I think you're responsible for the water injection system. Can you talk about what you think these volumes might rise to over the balance of this year and going into next couple of years? And also, how we should think about what your -- how your booked production is going to look like out of that?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure. Let me kind of hit the second question first and then move back to the first one. If we look at our production and the increases that we've got and are achieving, they're right on schedule, they're right on plan. We're not seeing any real constraints moving up to 320,000 barrels a day. And so from that standpoint, we're pleased and look forward to continuing our progress. As I mentioned from a production booking standpoint, very low in the first quarter because of the timing of hitting that target. And you'll see that ramp-up here a bit over the second quarter. We've got 3 rigs running now. We've got more rigs coming, workovers, facilities optimizations. So all of that stuff is up and running. Now as we go down the road, not only ourselves but the rest of industry, there are infrastructure needs to be addressed, one of which on the water injection side, ExxonMobil is leading that study, and that progresses. There are also needs for additional export capacity and facilities to move the oil out of the country, and those are being addressed as well. But both of those are large-scale efforts. They need to be undertaken. But it's too early for me to predict either the timing or the ultimate potential because it'll be -- there'll a number of factors that affect that. But I think your observation is spot on. Things are going very well right now, and we've got some infrastructure issues to address in the coming months and years.", "Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay. And can I ask, last quarter, you gave us a number for XTO's earnings per barrel, as distinct from the rest of the portfolio. Can you just update on that for this quarter?", "David Rosenthal", "I wasn't planning on giving any XTO-specific earnings numbers. We've kind of got that all wrapped up in our U.S. results that you've seen reported, and would continue to do that. I would offer, though, as we look at that unconventional business now through the end of the first quarter, we are very pleased with the progress we're making on integration. We're especially pleased with the synergistic results that we're starting to see, the fruition coming to bear of our efforts both on the addition of XTO resources to our global unconventional program. We've got folks working on planning and of our efforts there. And we have drilled some wells. We've got others planned. And we are certainly benefiting from the expertise that they bring to the table. Likewise, here in the U.S., we're really starting to see the benefit of combining some of heritage ExxonMobil's technology capabilities and research capabilities and some of the technologies that we developed in the tight gas realm being applied to the XTO business. And I don't have any numbers quote today, but I can tell you directionally, if you look at the objectives we have of improving capital efficiency, improving productivity and lowering operating costs, we are making good progress and are very pleased with how that's going. So the story there remains very positive, and we look forward to the upcoming quarters and years to again really, really get out of that resource what we had planned.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.", "Paul Cheng", "Dave, when I'm looking at your entire European gas output in the first quarter, it's 4.8 Bcf versus the first quarter 2010 is 5.1. And it's a little bit surprised that you dropped that much given the first quarter of 2011 weather was pretty cold and the pricing was strong. So we would expect that you will probably max out your gas output because the demand is there. So if -- that means that year-over-year we are dropping by, say, around 8% on the -- over 7% on the underlying decline curve on your European gas capacity or that the first quarter 2010 is just maybe some one-off accounting issue that number is high.", "David Rosenthal", "Paul, that is an excellent question. And interestingly enough, even though European demand was high in the first quarter '11, it was actually less than first quarter of '10 and really accounted for at least half, if not a little more, of the decrease you saw quarter-on-quarter, with the balance basically being a decline. But yes, we did see an overall demand drop relative to the first quarter of last year.", "Paul Cheng", "Interesting. I would have thought that the demand -- so the underlying decline is more like in the 3% to 4%? It's not the 7%?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, I didn't do that calculation. But yes, if you're looking overall at the decline figure, about half of that is demand and the other half is decline.", "Paul Cheng", "Okay. And then, you're talking about Iraq earlier. Can you tell us how the accounting works in terms of reporting the production and earnings now that you are about 10%? So does that mean that if the production in excess of the baseline, then you just report your 65% share? Or how exactly is the accounting in terms of reporting the production and the earning is going to be?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure, Paul. As you know, those contracts in Iraq are unique. They do have -- they do exhibit some elements that look like a PSC in terms of cost recovery. You do have, of course, then the remuneration, the fee that you get above the 10%. And then, of course, the actual volumes that you book are impacted by prices as well. So as we move forward, we'll be booking production just as the way we said those contracts work. We'll get the volumes for cost recovery, and then we'll get the volumes associated with the remuneration fee. And then we'll book the reserves accordingly as well.", "Paul Cheng", "So you basically will book similar like what you did in the PSC? So you have your -- let's say you have -- you'll spend $100 million in the cost and then your fee, for argument's sake, is going to be $10 million. So you will book -- your production will be equal to whatever. Let's say if it's $100 oil, then you book 11 million barrels in the production -- 1.1 million barrel in production. Is that the way that you're going to do?", "David Rosenthal", "Directionally, Paul, I think the math flows the way you're suggesting, and I'm sure there's a few nuances. But directionally speaking, that's how that's going to work.", "Paul Cheng", "Okay. If I could sneak in just a quick one.", "David Rosenthal", "Sure.", "Paul Cheng", "You're not going to talk about the XTO contribution. Can you tell us what is the XTO hours [ph] at oil and gas production for the quarter?", "David Rosenthal", "No, we really -- again, heading into this year, now that we've fully integrated that business into the rest of the U.S. results, we weren't planning to break out either the earnings or absolute production levels. But of course, if you look at the net growth year-over-year that we show in the volume start, the bulk of that is XTO. So again, I'll give you an indicator. We drilled, I think, 900-and-some wells in XTO last year, and we've already drilled 200 in the first quarter this year. So again, the business is doing well. But it's now going to be reported and fully integrated in with the rest of our U.S. results.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Katherine Minyard with JPMorgan.", "Katherine Minyard", "Just a couple of quick questions on the entitlement sensitivity both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. In your slide where you compare year-over-year, you've got about a 65,000 barrel a day change, and I've got about a $28 change in the Brent oil price. So that's about 2,300 barrels a day per $1 change in oil. Then if I look at the quarter-over-quarter, it looks to be about a 5,000-barrel a day change per dollar per barrel oil price change. So I was curious as to what the ratable sensitivity is on a go-forward basis and whether there was any one-off impact in the most recent quarter or over the course of the last year that would be skewing that.", "David Rosenthal", "Sure, Katherine. That's an excellent question. And the biggest factor we have in the sequential quarter more so than in the quarter-on-quarter is really in the price and spend effect. And the thing you have to keep in mind is both price and spend impact that. And so what we saw was we had higher prices quarter-to-quarter from the fourth quarter to the first quarter and much lower spending. But you kind of got a double whammy there of lower spending and higher prices, significantly lowering the volumes that you get.", "Katherine Minyard", "Okay.", "David Rosenthal", "We didn't see that impact quarter.", "Katherine Minyard", "And is there a rate we should be -- thinking about on a go-forward basis?", "David Rosenthal", "On a go-forward basis, I really couldn't give you a number because, again, I don't know what crude oil prices are going to do. And directionally, our spend levels tend to increase across the year. Particularly, relative fourth quarter to first quarter, you tend to see higher spending in the fourth quarter and lower spending in the first quarter, and we've seen that effect. So I really wouldn't have a number going forward other than to say the biggest impact on us is going to be the level of spending and then, of course, what crude oil prices do.", "Katherine Minyard", "Okay, great.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Allen Good with Morningstar.", "Allen Good", "Just a quick question. Can you give an update on Golden Pass and what kind of activity you're seeing down there?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure, I'd be happy to give you an overall update on that project. Things are going quite well. As you know, we are commissioning that in 2 phases. We've got the first phase done. That commissioning cargo actually arrived, the first one in the fourth quarter last year. And we brought in 5 additional cargoes. We got that thing up and running, actually exported some gas into the pipeline. And all the facilities are working. As we sit here today, Phase 2 is complete and in the commissioning stage, and we brought in our cargo for that. So we continue on the full commissioning and start-up of that terminal. And as you know, that's part of a broader strategy out of Qatar to have a footprint in all the -- a regas footprint in all the major markets and have left about a third of our volumes out of Qatar to be available to the spot market. And as the strategy was unfolded, the ability to divert those cargoes to get the highest netback is exactly what we're seeing today. And so we're taking all available cargoes into Europe, where we enjoy a nice spread there, as well as demand in the Asia Pac market for spot cargoes, in addition to our term contracts, is also strong. So we're very pleased with how all these facilities are coming along and especially pleased with the performance of our balance and mix of commercial arrangements.", "Allen Good", "Thanks for those comments on the LNG market. Just one more follow up on the Downstream earnings for international, there was a drop-off there from 4Q to this first quarter. I just want to confirm if that was due to the turnarounds you mentioned earlier throughout Europe and Asia. And I wanted to confirm that most of those facilities are back online and producing at full capacity.", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, you're right, the primary impact was the turnaround and maintenance-related activities. And as we're looking today --- and that was across Europe and Asia Pacific. And where we're sitting here today, those facilities are back up and running and came out of a very successful maintenance period.", "Allen Good", "Okay. And any more anticipated turnarounds either in Europe or throughout the U.S. for the remainder of the year?", "David Rosenthal", "I don't have a turnaround schedule, but I think you'll see normal turnaround and maintenance activities in the U.S. here in the second quarter kind of consistent with what we normally do and what industry normally does.", "Allen Good", "Okay, appreciate very much.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.", "Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Kind of a broad question, if I may. It's been almost a year, of course, since XTO closed. And I'm curious, how has the company's unconventional gas plans evolved for your overseas acreage and, in particular, if any of the drilling timetables have changed?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, I wouldn't say any of the drilling timetables have changed. Nonetheless, we do have a very active program underway, both coming out of 2010 as well as into 2011. For example, if you look at the Poland resources, we've been actively acquiring 3D seismic. We did get a well down in one of our licenses in the first quarter, and it finished up in February. We've got a second well that spud in February. So we're starting to do our evaluation program, our drilling program and would expect to continue to do that as the year goes on. If you look at Germany, there again, we have continued our evaluation efforts there and are drilling some additional wells. And we expect that program to continue on. But again, things are going about as we have planned, both in the shale gas in Germany as well in coal bed methane. We are getting wells down and are evaluating those results. And that'll determine the pace and extent of our program going forward. But we continue to view those opportunities very highly. I'll tell you, another area for us outside of the country is Argentina where we have also acquired a fairly large acreage position there. And we are doing evaluation and preparations to commence drilling there later on. So if I kind of step back and look at our total global unconventional portfolio, we continue to add to our acreage position. We are continuing to pursue additional acreage positions and, again, as I mentioned a little earlier, really leveraging the capabilities of ExxonMobil and XTO to both evaluate those prospects and, to the extent that any of them prove to be commercial, move into the development program. So about as planned but certainly a higher level of activity recently than a couple of years ago.", "Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "I appreciate the color on that. And then just real quick. Any changes at PNG LNG on either start-up of -- timing start-up or CapEx estimates?", "David Rosenthal", "No, I don't have any updated information. That project is on plan and doing fine, and we continue to project that we're going to deliver our first LNG out of there sometime in 2014. So that project is going well.", "Operator", "The final question comes from Mark Gilman with The Benchmark Company.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "David, what specifically was the gain on the Western Canada asset sale in the quarter?", "David Rosenthal", "Mark, as I typically do or don't do, I really don't have a number specifically for any one asset sale in the quarter.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "Okay, I'm going to try just one other one in light of that. Was there any lifting variance at all in this quarter, David, that could have impacted the Upstream side sales as less than or greater than the underlying level of production?", "David Rosenthal", "As we look quarter-on-quarter sequentially, I don't recall there being any impact.  ", "All right, well, I'll conclude the conversation then by thanking everyone for your time today and your questions. And we'll look forward to the second quarter earnings call in July.

The focus of this call is ExxonMobil's financial and operating results for the second quarter of 2011. I will refer to the slides that are available through the Investor section of our website. ", "Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our customary cautionary statement shown on Slide 2.", "Moving to Slide 3. We provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. The global economy and energy markets are being influenced by slower growth and continued uncertainty in the macro environment. A sustained economic recovery remains elusive as a result of persistent sovereign debt concerns, sluggish business investment and lower consumer spending. ", "Energy market continued to see strengthening in crude oil prices in the second quarter, while U.S. natural gas prices showed a modest increase. Downstream industry refining and marketing margins also improved during the quarter, while commodity Chemical margins weakened slightly.", "Turning now to the second quarter financial results as shown on Slide 4. ExxonMobil's second quarter 2011 earnings, excluding special items, were $10.7 billion, an increase of $3.1 billion from the second quarter of 2010. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 45%. Earnings per share for the quarter, excluding special items, were $2.18, up $0.58 from a year ago.", "The corporation distributed more than $7 billion to shareholders in the second quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $5 billion was distributed to purchase shares. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $5 billion in the third quarter of 2011. ", "CapEx from the second quarter was $10.3 billion, up $3.8 billion from the second quarter of 2010, reflecting the increase on our U.S. unconventional activities, including the recently completed acquisition of the Phillips Companies. Across our diverse portfolio, we continue to invest in robust projects through the business cycle to help meet global demand for crude oil, natural gas and finished products. ", "Our cash generation remains very strong with $14.4 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales. At the end of the second quarter, cash and marketable securities totaled $10.3 billion, and debt was $16.5 billion.", "The next slide provides additional detail on second quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter, cash and marketable securities decreased from $13.2 billion to $10.3 billion. The combined impact of strong earnings, depreciation expense, higher working capital and the benefit of our ongoing asset management program yielded $14.4 billion of cash flow from operations. ", "Uses included additions to plant, property and equipment or PP&E of $7.8 billion and shareholder distributions of $7.3 billion. Additional financing and investing reduced our cash and marketable securities by $2.2 billion including the acquisition of the Phillips companies. ", "We will now provide a review of segmented results starting on Slide 6. ExxonMobil's second quarter 2011 earnings of $10.7 billion increased $3.1 billion or 41% from the second quarter of 2010. Upstream earnings increased $3.2 billion, while Downstream earnings improved by $136 million. ", "Chemical earnings were essentially flat. ", "Higher corporate and financing expenses decreased earnings $174 million versus the second quarter of 2010 due mainly to the absence of favorable tax items. Corporate and financing expenses remain within our continued guidance of $500 million to $700 million per quarter. ", "As shown on Slide 7, ExxonMobil's second quarter 2011 earnings of $10.7 billion were in line with the first quarter of 2011 mainly due to higher Downstream earnings, offset by slightly lower Chemical and Upstream earnings.", "Moving next to the second quarter business highlights and beginning on Slide 8. We will begin with an update on a number of our Upstream liquids projects. During the quarter, we fully funded the Banyu Urip project on the Cepu Block in Indonesia. The full field development is expected to recover $450 billion oil equivalent barrels of reserves and deliver gross production of 165,000 barrels per day via a 60-mile pipeline to an offshore floating storage and offtake vessel in the Java Sea. ", "In Eastern Canada, we achieved early oil production from the first well of the Hibernia Southern Extension project. Project development will continue over the next few years, including drilling more wells and providing water injection capability with full production plateau anticipated in 2014.", "We also continue to ramp up activity in Iraq and currently have 5 drilling rigs operating. Current gross production is approximately 340,000 barrels per day. We are also progressing front-end engineering and agreements for the common seawater supply project. ", "And lastly, we continue to make strong progress at Kearl, where we are currently 68% complete with construction.", "Turning now to our exploration activities on Slide 9. Beginning in the Black Sea, where ExxonMobil holds 6.6 million net acres, the Deepwater Champion drillship arrived in the second quarter. We are now drilling in the Kastamonu exploration well in the Turkish Black Sea. We expect to have results from this high-risk, high-potential exploration well later this year. ", "In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where ExxonMobil holds 2.1 million net acres, we made a significant oil discovery with the Hadrian-5 exploration well, which commenced drilling in March, 3 days after receiving permit approval from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. ", "As recently reported, the Hadrian-5 wildcat confirmed the presence of a second oil accumulation in Keathley Canyon block 919. The well encountered 475 feet of net oil pay and a minor amount of gas. We are drilling ahead to deeper objectives and have encountered an additional 250 feet of net oil pay to date.", "Combined with our other Keathley Canyon blocks, we estimate a recoverable resource of more than 700 million oil equivalent barrels, making this one of the largest discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico in the last decade. More than 85% of the resource is oil. We're also working with our joint venture partners and other lessees in the areas to determine the best way to safely develop these resources as rapidly as possible.", "Turning now to the Phillips acquisition on Slide 10. ExxonMobil concluded the acquisition of the Phillips companies on June 2, 2011. The Phillips transaction included 317,000 net acres across the heart of the rapidly growing Marcellus Shale play and nearly doubles ExxonMobil's acreage to more than 700,000 net acres in the play. XTO will manage the Phillips assets from the recently established Appalachia Division headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ", "Given the proximity to our current operations in Southwestern Pennsylvania, the addition of the Phillips acreage will create significant value by leveraging regional synergies and also makes ExxonMobil a leading leaseholder in the Marcellus. The Phillips properties currently produce 50 million net cubic feet per day of natural gas, which includes both shallow gas and deeper Marcellus production. ", "Turning now to our total U.S. unconventional portfolio on Slide 11. In the U.S., XTO is currently managing total resources of 76 trillion cubic feet equivalent, which represents an increase of almost 70% from what was initially recognized at the time of the merger. As shown in the chart, nearly 2/3 of the resource additions are from revisions and corporate transfers, demonstrating the benefit of the XTO merger. The revisions resulted from buy-the-bid activities such as down spacing, additional development and new plays. ", "Over 12 trillion cubic feet equivalent of resource additions have been added through acquisitions, including the 2010 Ellora-Haynesville-Bossier and Petrohawk-Fayetteville acquisitions, the 2011 acquisition of the Phillips companies and several other low-cost acquisitions. These resources were added at an average cost of approximately $0.28 per thousand cubic feet equivalent.", "Turning now to our global unconventional portfolio on Slide 12. ExxonMobil has a diverse portfolio of the emerging unconventional resource opportunities with access to more than 10 million net acres in North and South America, Europe and Southeast Asia. ", "Beginning in Argentina, we hold approximately 240,000 net acres in the prospective Neuquen Basin and will begin drilling in the fourth quarter of 2011. In Canada, we are continuing drilling in the Cardium and the Horn River basins. In Columbia, we are preparing to begin core hole drilling in the fourth quarter to evaluate heavy oil potential. ", "In Poland, we are preparing for well testing. And in Germany, we are progressing permit approvals for our well testing program. In China, we are progressing opportunities with the Chinese national oil companies to apply ExxonMobil's leading-edge technology to develop unconventional gas resources. ", "Finally, in Indonesia, we've commenced coal bed methane drilling in the quarter and are now on our third well in the Barito Basin. ", "These opportunities represent a large and growing global portfolio of unconventional assets with the potential for significant value creation through the application of ExxonMobil's advanced technologies and XTO's strong operational and technical expertise.", "Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results starting on Slide 13. Upstream earnings in the second quarter were $8.5 billion, up $3.2 billion from the second quarter of 2010. Stronger crude oil and natural gas realizations increased earnings by $3.6 billion as crude oil realizations increased approximately $36 per barrel, and gas realizations increased $1.42 per kcf. ", "Production mix and volume effects decreased earnings by $480 million due mainly to the impact of lower entitlement volumes, downtime and decline, partly offset by the ramp-up of Qatar and Iraq projects and the addition of XTO. Additionally, earnings were negatively impacted by the timing of lifts. Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel were $21.35.", "Moving to Slide 14. Oil equivalent volumes increased 10% from the second quarter of last year, mainly due to growth in our U.S. unconventional resource business and the impact of Qatar and Iraq project ramp-up. Volumes were, however, negatively impacted by lower entitlement volumes, divestments, downtime, lower gas demand in Europe and decline.", "Turning now to the sequential comparison starting on Slide 15. Versus the first quarter of 2011, Upstream earnings decreased by $134 million. Stronger realizations improved earnings by $1.2 billion as crude oil realizations increased over $11 per barrel. Production mix and volume effects decreased earnings by a $1.1 billion due mainly to lower seasonal demand in Europe, higher maintenance and the impact of lower entitlement volumes. Additionally, earnings were negatively impacted by the timing of liftings. Other items, primarily higher exploration and operating expenses, decreased earnings by $310 million.", "Moving to Slide 16. Oil equivalent volumes decreased 9% from the first quarter of 2011 due mainly to lower seasonal demand in Europe, downtime and the impact of lower entitlement volumes. The facilities that experienced downtime during the second quarter of 2011 are now essentially up and running. ", "Lastly, I'll note that year-to-date oil equivalent volumes increased 10% or over 400,000 oil equivalent barrels per day compared to the first 6 months of 2010. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, quota effects and divestments, production was up over 12% and remains consistent with the 2011 volume guidance we communicated at the March Analyst Meeting of 3% to 4% growth versus 2010. For further data on regional volumes, please refer to the press release and IR supplement.", "Moving now to the Downstream financial and operating results starting on Slide 17. Downstream earnings in the second quarter were $1.4 billion, up $136 million from the second quarter of 2010. Improved margins increased earnings by $60 million, primarily driven by improved industry refining margins. Continued benefits from our refining optimization activities contributed $150 million in volume and mix effects while other factors were a negative $70 million.", "Moving to Slide 18. Sequentially, second quarter Downstream earnings increased $257 million. Higher industry refining and marketing margins increased earnings by $350 million, while volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $50 million. Other factors were a negative $40 million.", "Turning now to the Chemical financial and operating results and starting on Slide 19. Second quarter Chemical earnings were $1.3 billion, resulting in a record $2.8 billion of earnings for the first half of 2011. This performance demonstrates the value of our balanced portfolio of commodity and specialty businesses, integrated world scale facilities, premium products and technology application that delivers superior feedstock advantage. ", "Second quarter earnings were essentially even with the second quarter of 2010. Increased Chemical margins contributed $120 million, driven by strong demand. Volume and mix effects lowered earnings by $90 million, mainly due to higher plant maintenance activities. Other effects decreased earnings by $80 million.", "Moving to Slide 20. Sequentially, second quarter Chemical earnings decreased $195 million. Lower margins decreased earnings by $80 million, primarily due to weaker global aromatics margins. Other effects decreased earnings $110 million due mainly to higher turnaround and maintenance cost and some unfavorable tax benefits.", "Moving to Slide 21. While we manage our Downstream and Chemical businesses separately, we continue to capture benefits from the unique integration and optimization of these businesses. Looking at our combined Downstream and Chemical results, second quarter earnings were $2.7 billion.", "Moving to Slide 22. ExxonMobil's second quarter financial and operating performance was strong and reflects the ability of our business model and competitive advantages to deliver strong results. As we continue to focus on operational excellence, deploy high-impact technologies and leverage our unparalleled global integration, ExxonMobil remains well positioned to maximize long-term shareholder value. ", "That concludes my prepared remarks. I would now be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Doug Terreson at ISI.", "Doug Terreson - ISI Group Inc.", "I have a question, really just kind of a clarification. In the Upstream, you mentioned that the other item, which was fairly meaningful this quarter, was -- which was $310 million was exploration and something else. What was that something else, number one? And number two, was most of the delta this quarter exploration?", "David Rosenthal", "You're looking sequential at the $310 million?", "Doug Terreson - ISI Group Inc.", "Right.", "David Rosenthal", "Yes. The primary items there were the higher exploration expense as well as some higher production OpEx associated with the maintenance activities I mentioned.", "Doug Terreson - ISI Group Inc.", "Okay. And then together, that added up to a decent sales number. The $150 million in refining and marketing and Chemicals, just generally, what were those?", "David Rosenthal", "Oh, on the volume mix effects?", "Doug Terreson - ISI Group Inc.", "The other item, sequential?", "David Rosenthal", "Oh, sequential. Okay.", "Doug Terreson - ISI Group Inc.", "Yes. Sorry.", "David Rosenthal", "Yes. If you're looking sequentially on the Downstream earnings, the $40 million, there's really nothing significant to highlight. We did have some higher maintenance OpEx that I mentioned. That was the primary driver there.", "Doug Terreson - ISI Group Inc.", "Same in Chemicals? Is that the way to think about it?", "David Rosenthal", "In Chemicals, if you're looking at both, actually sequentially and quarter-over-quarter, it's really higher turnaround OpEx, the primary drivers there.", "Doug Terreson - ISI Group Inc.", "Okay. And also, you guys have obviously been very successful in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and I think you said you haven't TD-ed the exploration well yet. But so maybe earlier -- early, but do you have an idea as to future evaluation and approximate timing for that play? And also, is there transportation infrastructure in the area?", "David Rosenthal", "Well, if you look at what we're doing in the area -- and again, we do have a very nice oil discovery there. And as we've mentioned publicly, we are going to work with our partners and other lessees in the area, particularly with the Lucius discovery, to take that well and include it with their reserve so that we can give that production on safely and rapidly. The rest of the block, of course, we have both the Hadrian North discovery, which is a standalone oil discovery that will not be included in that unit. We're working on what the optimal development scenario in that might be. And we've also announced that the Hadrian South discovery, which is gas, will also be processed up through the assets in the Lucius discovery, again, to get that gas to market. So it's very fortunate that we have the ability to monetize a big portion of those reserves quickly, but at the same point, we're pretty excited. We're still drilling, and we got a lot of additional evaluation and appraisal to do out there. So it's a good success story and a nice opportunity to get some production on pretty quickly.", "Operator", "Next we'll move to Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated", "Just wanted to clarify on Hadrian while we're talking that -- you mentioned that the incremental 250 feet of pay, I wanted to just confirm, is that over and above what you had previously reported in the press release? And if so, does that indicate potential upside to the 700 million BOE?", "David Rosenthal", "The answer to that is yes to both of your questions. That's an addition to what we had announced earlier, and it certainly provides some upside. And also, as you know, it's normal in the -- in this business that there will also be some redetermination opportunities as we progress the current development of the Hadrian-5 well. So again, good news so far, lots more to look at and evaluate. And certainly, we'll be evaluating the upside, and we'll assess the total that we have once we hit TD.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated", "Okay. Great. And my second question, Dave, was on CapEx. If you look at the run rate for the first half of the year, it's an average of about $9 billion a quarter, which would kind of suggest about $36 billion total, which is maybe a couple of billion above what your guidance is. I'm just curious, does second half of the year likely fall off a bit? Or you may be trending above where guidance was?", "David Rosenthal", "Well, I think the first thing to note is if you take out the Phillips acquisition, the CapEx in the first half is right in line with what we talked about at the March Analyst Meeting. So ex any acquisition opportunities that come along, I really don't have any different guidance than what we talked about earlier in the year.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Mark Gilman at The Benchmark Company.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "If you could just help me and clarify, in your sources and uses of funds and that reconciliation, exactly where is the Phillips acquisition showing up. I thought it was in the additions to PP&E. And then there's this $2.2 billion item, which I guess, even with your comment, I still don't quite understand what it represents. Was there debt associated with Phillips and that's part of that $2.2 billion?", "David Rosenthal", "No, Mark. Mark, thanks for the opportunity to clarify that. No, the entire $1.7 billion that we've paid for the Phillips acquisition is in that $2.2 billion number called additional financing and investing. That's what that amount is. It's not in addition to PP&E.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "Okay. Was there debt associated with that acquisition, which I believe was a stock acquisition, not an asset acquisition?", "David Rosenthal", "No. There was no debt associated with that.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "Okay. My second one, you referred in your comments to liftings and timing effects on the production numbers. Does that mean or should I assume that your liftings in the second quarter of '11 were lower than production? Or was that delta versus the year ago period associated with second quarter 2010?", "David Rosenthal", "No. That's a good question. Let me clarify that. We were underlifted in the second quarter by about, in absolute terms, 69,000 barrels a day. And we were underlifted in the second quarter of last year about 26,000. So the delta is an additional 43,000 barrels a day underlift. And then sequentially, the factor was actually a little bigger. We were in the delta. We were a little overlifted in the first quarter. So if we look at the delta between first and second quarter sequentially, we're net under-lift position of 87,000.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "Try that last line one more time.", "David Rosenthal", "If you're looking sequentially, we were underlifted in the second quarter 69,000 barrels a day. We were overlifted a little bit in the first quarter 18,000 barrels a day. So that net between quarters was 87,000 barrels a day.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "Okay. Got it. That 6,900 lift, any particular region?", "David Rosenthal", "The bulk of it was in West Africa and the North Sea.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC", "So relatively high-margin barrels?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes.", "Operator", "Next, we'll move to Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Just a question on this CapEx. I mean, obviously, you are still responding after the XTO acquisition and picking up acreage here and there. I mean, should we think of sort of $2 billion here and there as a reasonable addition to your organic CapEx over the next couple of years?", "David Rosenthal", "Ed, I really don't have an answer to that, because we don't have a specific target or objective. It's purely opportunistic. As I've mentioned before, we, of course, are pursuing resources around the world, including unconventional in the U.S., all the time. And when we find a really good opportunity, like the Phillips acquisition for example, where we can leverage either some already existing assets that we have or bring some technology to bear, we will take advantage of that opportunity. But again, it's all about increasing value and particularly, leveraging what we have in the base through the merger with XTO. As you kind of start to see on that chart that we showed, you're really starting to see how that acquisition has enabled the growth in that business that otherwise would have been very, very difficult to accomplish. And then in particular, when you look at the low-cost that these incremental reserves and acreage are adding, and you start to look across that portfolio and then in addition, the opportunities that may come along from the additional volumes from overseas, you really start to see kind of what might be the value created by this global portfolio of unconventional assets. And again, with XTO as the enabler, just a year ago, it's pretty remarkable that 12 months after this merger, we've gone from 45 TCF under management to 76. So we're pretty pleased with that progress.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Maybe asking it a slightly different way. At 76 TCF, do you think you've got enough? Or do you think there's still going to be opportunities to continue to...", "David Rosenthal", "Well, we never have enough. I hope we can find some additional opportunities. We're certainly pursuing those. And again, if we come across something that's attractive, that we can bring something to the party to get value that others can't, we will, of course, take advantage of that. And again, as we've said from day one, we're looking for large high-quality resources with upside potential, where we can generate some synergies with the technology and operating expertise that we have. And again, we're actively pursuing those things but without any specific target or objective.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And then one final question on the Downstream in the U.S. I guess, perhaps a smaller uptick q-on-q than I guess I was looking for given the margin environment. Could this just be that 1Q was particularly strong? Or it could that Q2, there was some operational hiccup? Can you give -- talk to any funds that might be between the sequential differences?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure. As you mentioned, we did see some nice margin improvement in the U.S., particularly not only along the Gulf coast but as you're well aware of, in the mid-con area. We did have some downtime and maintenance in the second quarter. In particular, we were able to basically get back some of the volumes we lost in the first quarter from weather in the Gulf Coast, but that was offset by some maintenance activities in our Midwest refinery in Joliet.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Paul Cheng from Barclays Capital.", "Paul Cheng", "Dave, in the -- we heard from some industry news magazine talking about Papua New Guinea your LNG project may have some high copper, that some delay due to the labor or the way how the construction. So can you give us an update on what's going on over there? And is that going to result in any delay of the project startup?", "David Rosenthal", "No, Paul. Thank you. I'd be happy to give an update on that project. Things are going quite well. As a matter of fact, the project is progressing well. We've got project execution underway, including all the infrastructure development, roads, bridges, site preparation, camps, et cetera. We're scaling up the mobilization of the contractors as we get into the larger facility build. In fact, we've recently completed some very key milestones, and the project continues as planned. So I mean there's always minor things that come up in any projects, and we manage those. But as we look forward, the project is on target to deliver first LNG in 2014.", "Paul Cheng", "Okay. Second question, in the second quarter, can you tell us then what is the production with cost from your Iraqi project? And also that you talked about the underlift in the second quarter and overlift in the first quarter. At the end of June, are you, from an inventory standpoint, very neutral or that you are underlift, overlift? As well as the -- in the second quarter, is there any meaningful asset sales gain or not?", "David Rosenthal", "Okay, Paul. Let me track all 3 of these. Okay. When we look at the Iraq project, as we typically don't give individual country volume numbers, I don't have a specific number for you from Iraq. I think the key issue in Iraq is the progress that we're making there. That's going very well. We got 5 rigs running. I got production that grossed up to about 340,000 barrels a day. We're meeting our milestones, and we're working on the infrastructure necessary to continue to grow volumes. As you know, the actual production that you might record in any given quarter is really going to be a function of the price in that quarter as you divide your total revenue by the price to get the barrel. So I don't think that number would be as meaningful as really letting everybody know that the activity level is up. The production is up. We're meeting our expectations, and things are going pretty well in Iraq. If we look at the underlift position, I mentioned that in the second quarter, we were underlifted, on an absolute basis, about 69 kbd. And that's kind of where we are at the end of the second quarter.", "Paul Cheng", "So you're underneath by about 69 at the end.", "David Rosenthal", "Yes.", "Paul Cheng", "Okay. And then in terms of asset sales gain, is there any meaningful asset sales gain in the second quarter? Given your cash proceeds on asset sales is about in the $1.7 billion, and your CapEx base is pretty low, so I presume that you have some decent asset sales gain.", "David Rosenthal", "We have an ongoing asset management program, and we've had some nice sales this year already. Of course, we had sales in the first quarter that we talked about. And in the second quarter, we did sell our gas-led assets in Europe, and we did book a -- an asset gain on that. I don't have a specific number for it, but that is included. When you look -- and if you look quarter-on-quarter, in the second quarter, where we have the $60 million other effect, that asset gain is in that number.", "Paul Cheng", "Dave, then asset sales, you say your gas is in international E&P?", "David Rosenthal", "I'm sorry. Excuse me. Could you repeat?", "Paul Cheng", "The gain that you report, under which segment?", "David Rosenthal", "Oh, yes. That'll be in the non-US E&P, in the Upstream.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Faisel Khan in Citigroup.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "It's Faisel from Citi. I just wanted to go back to your comments on the resources you've kind of -- the resource evolution of XTO.", "David Rosenthal", "Sure.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "And I want to tie that, if I can, to the production volumes you've seen over the last few quarters. It seems like overall U.S. gas production volumes are relatively flat over the last few quarters, and oil production is relatively flat too. So can you talk to me a little bit about the underlying growth of those assets and where we are today?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure. If you're looking at the -- let's talk about the XTO first and looking at that chart. Of course, the chart I showed is really the evolution of the resource base itself. And so most of that is acreage that we're just now evaluating the pricing and drilling and that sort of thing, so you don't see a whole lot of production from those resource adds just yet. If you're looking at overall liquids and gas volumes in the U.S, if you're looking quarter-on-quarter this year versus last year, you do see about 72,000 barrels a day increase in liquids. The bulk of that, of course, comes from XTO. And then you do see in the U.S. about a 2.4 BCF a day increase in gas, the bulk of that, of course, coming from XTO. So that gets you year-over-year. When you're looking sequentially first quarter into the second quarter, U.S. liquids are flat, and that does reflect some improvement in the XTO volumes, offset by decline in downtime effect. Gas, as well, in the U.S., about flat quarter-on-quarter sequentially, and that's just reflecting just kind of the normal decline offset by the work programs. And we also had, you might recall, a sale of some Gulf of Mexico assets, and that's contributing a little bit to the overall U.S. numbers there. But overall, things are just as we expected.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "So overall, you continue to expect this portfolio to grow production in the U.S. over the foreseeable future?", "David Rosenthal", "Oh, sure. I mean, as we said in our -- in the Analyst Meeting, we do expect that production to grow over time as we develop and bring some of these resources online. But of course, that takes a little time. And it's over time, but we're working on it very aggressively.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "Last question for me. On the -- in your refinery throughput volumes in Asia Pacific, the fourth -- it looks -- it's in the fourth quarter into the first quarter. Those numbers went down for maintenance. And I thought -- in the second quarter, I thought your numbers will come back up. It looks like volume has ticked down sequentially in Asia Pacific first quarter, second quarter. I'm just wondering if you missed some sort of downtime of maintenance activity.", "David Rosenthal", "Well, it is. We did have continued maintenance, and it was actually a little higher even sequentially second quarter versus first quarter. So, second quarter was a big maintenance and turnaround quarter for us, in general, across the regions. But yes, you did see it in the Asia Pacific area.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc", "Okay. Is that -- are those facilities back up and running now at 100%?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, 100%. I know that most of that maintenance and downtime is up and running, and certainly, the turnaround, we're getting behind it.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "Two questions. As you discussed, Exxon clearly lead the foray into unconventional gas and oil globally, and my questions are on Polish shale. I know you're -- I know we're approaching some important industry well results in the next few months. You have a second well in 4Q. I guess with XTO's expertise, why not a faster ramp-up in Poland, where we have very attractive royalties, receptive host country, at least with the rash of hydro frac-ing concerns and oil-linked commodity prices? I mean, why not a faster ramp there? And maybe you can discuss your recent farm out of 49% interest of the Podlasie Basin to Total.", "David Rosenthal", "Sure. Let me step back and give you an overall update on Poland. Actually, we are progressing our activities there fairly rapidly. We had a 3D seismic acquisition program that we concluded in April of this year, and we've got -- we are currently processing those surveys on one of the concessions. And also, we have drilled -- we drilled one well that we suspended in February. We drilled another well that we suspended in April. And well test activity on those wells is underway, and we would expect to have those results sometime in the fall. So we are progressing what we would view as pretty aggressively here. And one of the things that, of course, helps that is the ability to leverage the XTO resources and have them help work on this and both define the appraisal program as well as understand what we have there as we move forward.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "Yes. With local services, recently, one of your competitors locked up Halliburton in a contract. I mean, how do you see availability of services? And how are you proceeding to make sure that you have what you need to develop that resource?", "David Rosenthal", "Well, clearly, getting services is a challenge to the broader industry as we all advance our plans there. I can tell you, without being specific in terms of contracts that we have in place that we don't have any issues with services and getting the facilities we need. And so we're moving right along. And again, there's no obstacle in the way of progress, and we continue to progress that fairly rapidly.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. A second question on international gas realizations. It's typically been well correlated with a lagged Brent. Some correlations have been dropping, which I guess would be a function in mix in Qatar volumes. I mean can you give me -- provide any regional delivery destination on uncontracted LNG volumes generally? And then I guess it would be interesting to know what percent was moving into Asian markets, where slopes are north of 14 today?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure. Let me hit the latter one and then I'll come back to the former one. There really hasn't been any change in the delivery destinations of the LNG coming out of Qatar. As we've said before, about 2/3 of it is heading into the Asia Pac area. And the other third, which is a core spot, some of that's going to Europe. Some of it's going into the Asia Pac area. So I think that strategy is working out very well. We did see when you look at the price realization, a bit of a mix effect in the quarter. We did have some downtime on the LNG trains, but that volume was offset by higher flowing gas deliveries into the local market. As we've talked about before, the realizations in the margins in the local market are less than what you see, obviously, in the delivered LNG. So we did have a mix effect on the overall realization that you saw in our international gas business.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "And just one last question on a matter of clarification. I think on volumes, you said in your remarks that volumes off-line in the quarter were -- they were out for maintenance or back. Were you referencing both European and Qatar gas volumes?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes. As we look out at where we have the maintenance and downtime over the quarter and again, a lot of that -- of course, a lot of that is your normal scheduled maintenance that you have seasonally in the second quarter, and so we saw some of that. And yes, that maintenance -- if you look at that maintenance by and large, that's back online. We do still have some stuff we're working on, but all of it is either online or coming online and will be up shortly.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Iain Reid at Jefferies.", "Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Can I ask 2 questions? On the resource base you're showing there for XTO, what you've managed to, obviously, improve significantly since the day of the merger, can you say how much of that is liquids in terms of the way you've determined the resource?", "David Rosenthal", "I don't have the exact split with me. I can tell you, obviously, the bulk of it is going to be gas. I know there is some liquids content in there, but I just don't -- I don't have the breakdown of that resource.", "Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay. I'm just thinking more generally about your unconventional gas in the U.S. in particular. I think you've made statements about trying to shift some of your activities towards oil. Could we expect to see quite a lot of that resource remaining undeveloped at this sort of level of gas prices? Or how do you think about the kind of short-term economics of developing this enormous resource now in the U.S.?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes. Let me make a couple of comments on that. Certainly, we are optimizing the rigs and equipment that we have in the human resources that we have available to the highest return opportunities, which of course, does include trying to optimize that mix between liquids and gas volumes. And we're actively pursuing that, as are others, and that's going quite well. I will tell you, in the U.S., when we're looking at our gas wells, all of our gas wells are economically attractive that we're drilling. We have a paced development of the gas resources. We're fortunate that we have very few leases that we have to drill the hole. We've got a very high percentage held by production or fee property, so we're really able to maximize the returns we're getting and optimize where we're locating our drilling activities. So as we look out today, we've got between 65 and 70 rigs running, and those rigs are drilling economically attractive rigs even at today's prices.", "Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "And how many of those rigs are drilling oil prospects or unconventional prospects?", "David Rosenthal", "Let's see. I don't know that I have that detailed breakdown. Clearly, when you look at the size and the relative size of our resource, most of them, of course, are in gas. I can tell you, just as an example, we've got 7 rigs running in the Bakken, whereas -- that's up, as you know, from the rigs that were running at the time of the merger. So we continue to progress that. And of course, we do have a number of rigs running in the Eagle Ford. If I recall right, that's probably left about 2 rigs running in the Eagle Ford, for example, and we continue to access those resources as quickly as possible. So I would say, in summary, other than the Bakken and the Eagle Ford, anywhere we have an opportunity to optimize a rig and get it on liquids production, we're certainly doing that. Another area, although I don't have the exact rig count, we're pursuing tight oil in West Texas. That's just another example of where we've ramped up that activity here recently. So overall, again, it's take that resource, optimize your people and your equipment for the highest-impact wells. And that could be liquids, and it could also be very attractive gas wells.", "Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Just ask one more clarification, actually, which I think I missed earlier. What was the absolute volume number in terms of maintenance in the quarter in the Upstream?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure. If I look at maintenance -- absolute level of maintenance in the Upstream, for the quarter, we had about an extra 37,000 barrels a day if you look at what we're doing in the second quarter of 2011 versus the second quarter of '10. And sequentially, it is probably a more important number to you. If I look sequentially first quarter to second quarter, we had right at 100,000 barrels a day additional maintenance in the second quarter compared to the first quarter.", "Operator", "And next, we'll move to Doug Leggate at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I'm sorry to lever this maintenance issue. I -- clearly, there's -- there seems to be an issue relating to the kind of margins that came off-line. Could you quantify please the, if possible, order of magnitude as to the absolute maintenance off-line in the second quarter as opposed to the deltas versus prior quarters? And if I may dig a little bit into Qatar in particular, because my understanding is you kind of got $1, $1.50 type domestic prices versus oil link prices internationally. So if you could maybe quantify how much Qatari volumes are off-line also? And I've got a quick follow-up please.", "David Rosenthal", "Doug, I don't have any specific details on the absolute amounts of the downtime. I can tell you if you're looking sequentially in Qatar, we had about 27,000 barrels oil equivalent a day off-line as we did some work there. But that's the delta. I don't know what the absolute amounts were between the quarters. But we did see, sequentially, some maintenance activity there.", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Would it be fair to characterize the 27,000 as moving from oil link to something in a $1, $1.50 type level?", "David Rosenthal", "Well, I think you could see it as moving from delivered LNG as instead going in flowing gas into the country. I don't want to quote any prices or differentials, but as we've talked about before, the flowing gas in the domestic market sells at a much lower price than our delivered LNG does.", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Got it. My follow-up is just a very quick one. I don't know if you mentioned this earlier, and if you did, I apologize. I was late getting on the call. Cash flow, what was the working capital impact in the quarter? Because it looked a bit light relative to what the run rate should probably have been. I'll leave it there.", "David Rosenthal", "Sure. If you're looking just in the second quarter, we did see a working capital build of about $2 billion in the quarter.", "Douglas Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Great stuff and any thoughts on how the share buybacks evolved beyond the third quarter given the current environment?", "David Rosenthal", "No. I don't have any guidance to give on that other than in the third quarter, we intend to purchase another $5 million worth of shares.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Paul Sankey at Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG", "David, we've been obviously over a lot of this various stuff. But just on the European gas volumes, can you clarify what looks like a 20% down move year-over-year in volumes? I think you were -- excuse me, 3.26 BCF a day down to 2.69. I know that it's probably worth passing what you've previously said into an answer on this, but what was the kind of dynamic behind that down move?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes. If we look at that -- the move down of notionally 600 a day -- you're talking about quarter-on-quarter, second quarter?", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG", "Yes.", "David Rosenthal", "Actually, about 1/3 of that was European demand, just lower demand quarter-on-quarter. And then the bulk, the rest of it was just normal decline, and we also had some downtime, additional downtime in the second quarter.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. I assume -- I know I can check the dates, but you can probably just tell me that you're not bringing any LNG into the U.S. market.", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, we're not bringing any LNG to speak of into the U.S. market.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG", "When we were together earlier this year, you did say that you will use changing on exports of LNG from the U.S. Can you update us on that, please?", "David Rosenthal", "Well, I remember discussing this, because I don't think I said our views have changed. I said we, like everybody else, of course, are always analyzing all the opportunities that might be out there. Some folks are already announcing and discussing plans that they have. And what I can clarify for you is that we don't currently have any plans to either re-export LNG or export LNG from the U.S. market. But again, we have a lot of gas, and we're continually evaluating all the opportunities to bring that gas to market.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG", "Yes, I think that should clarify. I think what you're saying is that 2, 3 years ago, you would have thought exports were totally out of the question. Whereas now, it becomes a bet on whether or not these differentials, these price, these regional price differentials will hold for...", "David Rosenthal", "Yes. Clearly, for those who are looking at this and when you got to talk about building liquefaction capacity in the U.S., you're either making that 25- or 30-year bet on the continued spread between European spot prices and U.S. spot prices as they exist today, or you're going to find a way to get that gas to the Far East. So yes, 3 or 4 years ago, I don't think anybody was talking about it. As we've noted across the industry, there are folks talking about it, but we'll need to see how that progresses over time.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG", "Sure. I think what you've also said, more or less, is that, really, you're going to continue pursuing the XTO business model, I guess, with the merger of the best practices of both companies but essentially, the business model of quite aggressive growth and acquisitions on an ongoing basis. And it seems that you've kept up the pace of XTO acquisitions since the takeover. Is it fair to say that we should -- and I think Ed Westlake was referring to this -- consider that to be the business model going forward and therefore, as we've seen in this quarter's results, add in an extra slug of acquisition capital on top of the guidance of I think $33 billion to $37 billion a year of CapEx that you gave us at the Analyst Meeting?", "David Rosenthal", "Paul, let me answer that kind of in 2 separate ways. Yes, the XTO model is continuing. We are -- we have been able to acquire both a lot of small acreage positions in terms of getting acreage that's surrounding acreage that we already have. And we don't talk about those, but those are all going. And then we have, as I mentioned, between last year and this year, in just 12 months, made some really nice opportunistic acquisitions at very attractive prices to what we have. So assuming that we can continue to find these things and we're looking at them, I don't have a number for you or anything to put in the model other than to say as these things come up, and we find them, and they have the same characteristics as what we've been looking at, yes, you would -- I would expect us to take advantage of those opportunities. Particularly again, given the leverage we get from that XTO organization and where it's located and what they already have and the ability to add these things without adding a lot of overhead and without having to change organizations and do that sort of thing, these things are very attractive. And we certainly hope we'll continue to have these opportunities, but I just wouldn't have any guidance in terms of a number, because it could be a fairly wide range.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG", "Yes, I understand. On the pipelines, firstly, could you update us on the near Billings spill? Any news that you would want to share with us on that? And secondly, are you intending to do anything to address the big spread that we have between these inland crudes obviously manifested in the Brent-WTI spread? Have you -- what's your view on that and any potential investments you would make to address that spread?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure. Let me hit the Silvertip pipeline incident first. And I'd like to say right up front that we deeply regret that incident, and we are fully committed to completing the cleanup, learning about what happened there, how to prevent something like it from happening again and really maintaining our focus on effective cleanup and remediation of the impacting area and taking care of the folks that were impacted by this incident. Progress is going very well. We got about 800 people working out there on that, and the cleanup is progressing very well. When we look at Billings, Billings is still running at reduced rates. We are working on the logistics to be able to supply feed to that refinery other than what used to come through the pipeline. We have begun some preliminary work on replacing the pipeline, including discussions on permitting requirements and that sort of thing, lining up equipment and materials. I can't give you a time as when we might be fully restored there, but we are progressing that at the same time, again, as we are progressing the cleanup and the impacts from the initial spill. If we looked more broadly at our supplier organization and what's going on today, in the mid-con in particular and folks talking about, as we all know, the constraints there that are generating this wide spread, we are, as we talked about before, optimizing to the extent possible not only the advantage you can get in the mid-con with the Brent-WTI spread, but also, when you look at our refining circuit all the way from Canada, all the way down to the U.S. Gulf Coast, we continue to optimize our own feed plates and really to process a number of advantaged crudes including the Canadian heavy crudes, shale oil, other heavy crudes, shale oil that's coming out of the U.S. So a lot of those things are advantaged to a Brent or an LLS crude, for example. And to the extent we're able to get those and run them into our refining circuit, we're certainly doing so. So it's not just the WTI-Brent, in fact, in the mid-con but also the ability to move these other crudes into your refineries, again, both in Canada and the Gulf Coast. And we are actively pursuing that, and that's reflected in some of the volume mix impacts that you see.", "Paul Cheng", "I've got the idea. There's probably one minute to go on this call, but are you using rail at all?", "David Rosenthal", "Are we using rail to move crudes?", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG", "Yes.", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, I believe we're moving some of our Bakken crude out by rail.", "Operator", "And next we'll go to John Herrlin of Societe Generale.", "John Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research", "Your international exploration expense was about $0.5 billion higher than normal. Could you attribute it to projects? Or were you spending more on seismic? What was going on there internationally?", "David Rosenthal", "If you look internationally at the exploration expense, the driver there for the increase, we had some dry hole expense in the Philippines and also in Vietnam in the quarter.", "John Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research", "Okay. You gave the one piece for your unconventional reserve adds to -- or 3P at $0.28. What about 1P for the unconventional, for proven?", "David Rosenthal", "I don't have a number just for the proven. The way we look at this, really, is how much acreage are we getting and what are we paying for it? And then as we look at that total resource base that's out there, what are we getting? And how much were we paying for that? And annually, as we always do and we'll do that in February, we'll do a more robust reserves reporting of the proved as well as the unproved. The real purpose of the chart today was just kind of to step back at the one year post merger mark and kind of give you folks an update on the progress we've made in just a short year in terms of leveraging what we got at the merger and really showing the advantages that we're getting now in the resource base and also, tell you from a transition standpoint things continue to go very well. Attrition remains low. Management team is still in place, and the organization is working hard on the opportunities they had at the time of the merger and then all the opportunities that we've added over the last 12 months. So when you think strategically about the acquisition and the objectives we laid out at the time, we talked about the merger. Those objectives are being met, and we're very pleased with the progress and very excited about the future.", "John Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research", "Okay. Two more. You mentioned the attrition rate. What is low percentage-wise?", "David Rosenthal", "We're not quoting percentage. It\u2019s equivalent to what it's been prior to the merger, the same rates kind of that people have had before. It's fairly low. But again, I think the important thing for us is 13 months after the merger, it's remaining low, and it's -- it just hasn't been an issue for us.", "John Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research", "Okay. With the Phillips acquisition, are you capitalizing most of that?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, we'll be capitalizing that acquisition.", "John Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research", "Okay. Last one for me. As you get more unconventional, as you start losing things like West African output, I think a lot of people have been getting around the question of maybe you're losing higher-margin barrels, and you're going to more cost-intensive type activities on a unit basis. Should we assume that your operating cost Upstream are going to start to increase a little bit?", "David Rosenthal", "When you look across our portfolio and the diversity, both from a resource standpoint as well as a geographic standpoint, at any given time, depending on how we're bringing those volumes onstream, you might see upturns and downturns in both profitability and unit cost. A lot of these things come on in big chunks. Obviously, bringing Qatar on over the last few years had an impact. We've talked about the impact Kearl will have in some of the other major projects. So I wouldn't want to make an overall judgment as to what to expect going forward. I mean, in quarter-to-quarter, of course, as we saw this quarter, you do you see impacts of things like exploration expense.  [indiscernible] Going forward, [indiscernible] one way or the other.", "Operator", "And we'll go to Pavel Molchanov at Raymond James.", "Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "I'll squeeze this one in. Since the last call, we've seen yet another one of your peer companies split into upstream and downstream halves. And of course, we've seen others gradually divesting refineries. Exxon's been kind of absent from that process. Just wanted to get your thoughts on that industry dynamic.", "David Rosenthal", "Well, I really can't speak for some of our competitors and what they're doing with their business plans. Clearly, when we look at our Downstream business and the tremendous value we generate with integration with the Chemicals business and how that whole portfolio is generating the types of earnings and the types of returns that you've seen them generate over the last couple of years, every time we look at this, we conclude that our integrated model combined with our global functional organization just delivers what we've referred to in the past as a \"sum of the parts plus\" kind of valuation. And so for ExxonMobil, as long as we can continue to maintain that advantage and in fact, increase it through technology advances in some of the investments we're making, I think you'll see, over time, that model will continue to work for us. Now if it's broken for others or others don't see the same kind of advantage that we do, it's not surprising that you might see some different approaches, but I wouldn't classify it as lagging some of the others. I'd really view it as just continuing to take advantage of the unique situation we have and the competitive advantages we get out of that and continue to exploit it. ", "Okay. Thank you all very much.", "Operator", "And that does conclude today's conference.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call and Webcast. The focus of this call is ExxonMobil's financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2011. I will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. ", "Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our customary cautionary statement shown on Slide 2. Moving to Slide 3, I'll start with an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global economic recovery was slower in the fourth quarter, largely due to weakness in Europe. GDP improvement in the United States and Japan was tempered by negative growth in the European Union. U.S. real GDP growth was 2.8%, improving from 1.8% in the third quarter, while Japan delivered another quarter of positive growth as post-earthquake recovery continues. In general, non-OECD growth remains robust, even with the slight decline in growth from China. Energy markets were mixed in the fourth quarter. Crude oil and non-U.S. natural gas prices remain strong, while worldwide industry refining margins saw significant declines, as did commodity chemicals margins. ", "Turning now to the fourth quarter financial results as shown on Slide 4. ExxonMobil's fourth quarter 2011 earnings, excluding special items, were $9.4 billion, an increase of $150 million from the fourth quarter of 2010. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 47%. Earnings per share for the quarter, excluding special items, were $1.97, up $0.12 from a year ago. The corporation distributed more than $7.2 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $5 billion was utilized to purchase shares. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $5 billion in the first quarter of 2012. CapEx in the fourth quarter was $10 billion, consistent with the fourth quarter of 2010. ", "We continue to invest in robust projects throughout the business cycle, all of which served to help meet global demand for crude oil, natural gas and finished products, while supporting economic growth, including job creation. Our cash generation remains strong with $17.6 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales, including $6.9 billion associated with asset sales. At the end of the fourth quarter 2011, cash and marketable securities totaled $13.1 billion, and debt was $17 billion. ", "The next slide provides additional detail on fourth quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter, cash and marketable securities increased from $11.3 billion to $13.1 billion, including cash on deposit associated with potential asset sales, which have not yet closed and, therefore, are not reflected in earnings. The combined impact of strong earnings, depreciation expense, higher working capital and the benefit of our ongoing asset management program yielded $17.6 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included additions to plant, property and equipment, or PP&E, of $8.6 billion and shareholder distributions of $7.2 billion. Additional financing and investing activities had no net impact in the quarter. ", "Moving now to the full year results as shown on Slide 6. ExxonMobil's full year 2011 earnings, excluding special items, were $41.1 billion, up $10.6 billion from 2010. Earnings per share for the year, excluding special items, were $8.42, up $2.20 from 2010. The corporation distributed $29 billion to shareholders in 2011 through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $20 billion was utilized to purchase shares. CapEx in 2011 was $36.8 billion, up $4.5 billion from 2010, mainly due to acquisitions of unconventional assets, including the Phillips companies, and continued progress on our world class project portfolio, including the Kearl oil sands project. Our cash generation was very strong with $66.5 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales, including $11.1 billion associated with asset sales. ", "Moving now to the full year cash flow statement as shown on Slide 7. During the year, cash and marketable securities increased from $8.5 billion to $13.1 billion, including cash on deposit associated with potential asset sales which have not yet closed and, therefore, are not reflected in earnings. The combined impact of strong earnings, depreciation expense, higher working capital and the benefit of our ongoing asset management program yielded $66.5 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included additions to plant, property and equipment, or PP&E, of $31 billion and shareholder distributions of $29 billion. Additional financing and investing activities decreased our cash and marketable securities by $1.9 billion. ", "Moving on to Slide 8 and a review of our segmented results. ExxonMobil's fourth quarter 2011 earnings of $9.4 billion increased $150 million from the fourth quarter of 2010. Upstream earnings increased $1.3 billion, while Downstream earnings decreased by $725 million. Chemical earnings were down $524 million. Lower corporate and financing expenses increased earnings $50 million versus the fourth quarter of 2010. ", "As shown on Slide 9, ExxonMobil's fourth quarter 2011 earnings of $9.4 billion declined by $930 million compared with the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to lower industry refining and chemicals margins. ", "Looking now at the full year comparison on Slide 10, ExxonMobil's full year 2011 earnings, excluding special items, were up $10.6 billion to $41.1 billion, an increase of 35% from 2010, primarily due to strong oil and gas realizations. Upstream earnings increased $10.3 billion, while Downstream earnings were up $892 million, and Chemical earnings were down $530 million. Corporate and financing expenses for the full year in 2011 were $2.2 billion, down $104 million from 2010. Our guidance for corporate and financing expenses continues to be $500 million to $700 million per quarter. ", "Moving next to fourth quarter business highlights, beginning on Slide 11. The offshore installation of our deepwater Angola Satellites project is nearly 50% complete, with development drilling well underway and targeting startup in mid-2012. The project will involve a subsea tie-back to the existing Kizomba A and B FPSOs and produced approximately 100,000 barrels per day on a gross basis. This level of production is similar to levels achieved by FPSOs at our Saxi Batuque and Mondo development. The PNG project is also progressing as planned towards a 2014 startup. Recent milestones include completion of over 130 kilometers of offshore pipeline, welding of over 100 kilometers on the onshore pipeline and commencement of piling work at the Hides gas conditioning plant. At Banyu Urip in Indonesia, we have issued 5 major EPC contracts, including those associated with the onshore and offshore pipelines and mooring tower. The project remains on schedule for full field production in 2014 with a targeted initial gross production of 165,000 barrels per day. ", "In the Gulf of Mexico, we funded our interest in the Lucius development, which is scheduled for a 2014 startup. ExxonMobil's Hadrian South discovery will also tie into the Lucius facility with startup planned for 2014. Also, during the quarter, we completed a settlement with the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Department of Justice regarding the Julia field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. This will allow us to progress the initial phase of development of this important discovery. ", "Now turning to Slide 12. Construction at the Kearl Initial Development is now 87% complete and is on schedule to start up in late 2012 with an initial gross production rate of approximately 110,000 barrels per day. Also, during the quarter, we funded the Kearl expansion project, which will add an additional 110,000 barrels per day of production and is anticipated to start up in late 2015. When combined with the Kearl Initial Development, the expansion will develop 3.2 billion barrels. Future debottlenecking of both phases will increase output to reach the regulatory capacity of 345,000 barrels per day and fully develop the 4.6 billion barrel resource. ", "Turning now to an exploration update on Slide 13. ExxonMobil maintains a balanced global exploration portfolio, which supports an active exploration drilling program aimed at testing new play concepts, opportunities in existing basins and near field wildcats across the globe. For example, we are currently drilling a well in the Black Sea offshore Romania and participating in an exploration well offshore Tanzania, both of which will test new deepwater play concepts. In Nigeria, we mobilized the West Polaris rig and commenced a new deepwater exploration program in oil production License 214. In the Gulf of Mexico, we were the high bidder on 50 new exploration blocks in Lease Sale 218, which further strengthened our acreage position in the western Gulf of Mexico and leveraged our advanced seismic imaging capability. This technology will allow us to progress new exploration opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico and other basins around the world. We also maintain an active global unconventional exploration drilling program. ", "I will now provide an update on some of these activities on Slide 14. We continue to focus our drilling activity to maximize development of liquids-rich plays. In the Woodford Ardmore, we added another rig and now have 8 operated rigs developing this recently discovered liquids-rich resource where we hold more than 170,000 net acres. Current drilling is focused on delineating this acreage, which more than tripled in 2011, as well as determining optimal well spacing and drilling and completion practices. Ardmore well performance continues to be strong, and we completed a total of 31 new wells in 2011. In the Bakken Shale, we have 7 operated rigs developing roughly 400,000 net acres of leasehold. In 2011, we drilled and completed a total of 51 wells, including 18 in the fourth quarter. And notwithstanding severe weather in the first half of 2011 and increased downtime, our net Bakken liquids production increased 27% in 2011 versus 2010. In the fourth quarter alone, net Bakken liquids production increased 13% versus the third quarter 2011 and 41% versus the fourth quarter of 2010. In the Permian Basin of West Texas, we have 5 operated rigs which are developing conventional plays, as well as testing new liquids-rich unconventional opportunities. In Canada, we have had encouraging early results in the Cardium, with 2 wells on production at year end and additional drilling planned in 2012. Finally, we commenced drilling 2 wells in the Neuquen Basin in Argentina in December to test unconventional liquids and gas potential. ", "Turning now to Slide 15 with an update on the Downstream. We continue to make targeted investments where there is an attractive growth opportunity. We are investing to help meet growing demand for motor fuels with cleaner burning formulas and to sustain the competitiveness of our refining portfolio well into the future. During the quarter, we completed a lower-sulfur fuels project at our Sriracha Thailand refinery, which will increase production of cleaner gasoline and diesel fuels at the refinery by over 50,000 barrels per day. Additionally, construction of a lower-sulfur fuels project has begun at the joint Saudi Aramco and ExxonMobil SAMREF Refinery in Yanbu, Saudi Arabia. The project will include new gasoline and diesel hydrotreating and sulfur recovery equipment with completion expected by the end of 2013. ", "Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results and starting on Slide 16. Upstream earnings in the fourth quarter were $8.8 billion, up $1.3 billion from the fourth quarter of 2010. Stronger crude oil and natural gas realizations increased earnings by $2 billion as crude oil realizations increased over $22 per barrel and gas realizations increased $1.09 per kcf. Production mix and volume effects decreased earnings by $1.5 billion due mainly to the impact of lower entitlement volumes in West Africa, base decline, downtime, divestments and lower-than-normal seasonal demand in Europe, partly offset by the ramp-up of Angola and Iraq projects. All other items, primarily gains from asset divestments, increased earnings by approximately $800 million. Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel for the fourth quarter of 2011 were $21.18. ", "Moving now to Slide 17. Oil equivalent volumes decreased 9% from the fourth quarter of last year, mainly due to the impact of lower entitlement volumes in West Africa, decline, downtime, lower-than-normal seasonal demand in Europe and divestments. Volumes were positively impacted by the ramp-up of projects in Angola and Iraq and continued strong performance in our U.S. unconventional resource business. Excluding the impacts of lower entitlement volumes, quotas and divestments, production declined about 4%. ", "Turning now to the sequential comparison starting on Slide 18. Versus the third quarter of 2011, Upstream earnings increased by $435 million. Higher realizations increased earnings by $190 million as crude oil realizations remained strong and natural gas realizations increased $0.46 per kcf. Production mix and volume effects increased earnings by $50 million due mainly to higher seasonal demand in Europe, partly offset by the impact of divestments. Other items, primarily gains from asset divestments and lower exploration expenses, partly offset by higher operating expenses at unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, increased earnings by $190 million. ", "Moving to Slide 19. Oil equivalent volumes increased 6% from the third quarter of 2011 due mainly to higher seasonal demand in Europe and the ramp-up of projects in Angola, partly offset by the impact of divestments. ", "Turning now to the full year comparison and starting on Slide 20. Upstream earnings were $34.4 billion in 2011, an increase of $10.3 billion from 2010. Improvements in global realizations led to an increase in earnings of $10.6 billion. Lower liquid volumes, mainly due to lower entitlement volumes in West Africa and base decline, partly offset by project ramp-up in Qatar, lowered earnings by $2.5 billion. All other items, driven by higher gains on asset sales of about $2.7 billion, increased earnings by $2.2 billion. ", "Moving to Slide 21. Volumes grew by 1% or 59,000 oil equivalent barrels per day compared to 2010. Ramp-up of projects in Russia, Qatar, Iraq and Angola, combined with continued strong performance in our U.S. unconventional resource business, more than offset the impacts of base decline, divestments and lower entitlement volumes in West Africa. Excluding the impacts of lower entitlement volumes, quotas and divestments, production was up over 4%. For further data on regional volumes, please refer to the press release and the IR supplement. ", "Moving now to the Downstream financial and operating results and starting on Slide 22. Downstream earnings in the fourth quarter were $425 million, down $725 million from the fourth quarter of 2010. Lower industry refining margins contributed to a decrease in earnings of $740 million, while volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $30 million. Other factors increased earnings by $40 million. ", "Moving to Slide 23. Sequentially, fourth quarter Downstream earnings declined $1.2 billion, largely driven by significantly lower industry refining margins. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $60 million, while other factors increased earnings by $360 million, primarily due to inventory or LIFO benefits and the higher gains on asset sales. ", "The full year comparison of the Downstream is shown on Slide 24. Downstream full year 2011 earnings were nearly $4.5 billion, up $892 million from 2010. Higher industry refining margins contributed to an increase in earnings of $800 million. Volume and mix effects improved earnings by $630 million, reflecting the ongoing benefits from investments and refining optimization activities. Other effects decreased earnings by $540 million, mainly due to the absence of favorable tax effects and higher expenses. ", "Turning now to the Chemical financial and operating results and starting on Slide 25. Fourth quarter Chemical earnings were $543 million, a decrease of $524 million versus the fourth quarter of 2010. Lower margins decreased earnings by $230 million mainly in commodity chemicals, while volume effects decreased earnings $40 million. Other factors decreased earnings by $250 million, primarily due to unfavorable tax affects. ", "Moving to Slide 26. Sequentially, fourth quarter Chemical earnings decreased $460 million. Commodity chemical margins declined significantly, driving a negative earnings impact of $390 million. Volume effects increased earnings by $10 million, while other effects decreased earnings by $80 million. ", "On Slide 27, we show the full year comparison for Chemical results. 2011 earnings were nearly $4.4 billion, including record specialty chemical earnings of about $1.8 billion. Overall, stronger margins increased earnings by $260 million, while volume effects decreased earnings by $180 million, mainly due to higher planned maintenance in 2011. Other effects reduced earnings by $610 million, primarily due to unfavorable tax effects and higher planned maintenance expenses. While the fourth quarter was a reminder that the Chemical business is cyclical in nature, ExxonMobil's quality portfolio of both commodity and specialty chemicals provides upside benefit when commodity margins are strong and a stable, less cyclical specialties earnings base when commodity chemical margins are weaker. We continue to leverage our feed advantage, integration, cost discipline and premium product offerings to outperform throughout the cycle. While we manage our Downstream and Chemical businesses separately, we continue to capture benefits from the unique integration and optimization of these businesses. Both businesses delivered strong results in 2011, with combined earnings of $8.8 billion, up $360 million from 2010. ", "Moving to Slide 28. ExxonMobil's fourth quarter and full year financial and operating performance was strong and reflects the ability of our business model and competitive advantages to deliver superior results. As we continue to focus on operational excellence, deploy high-impact technologies and leverage our unparalleled global integration, ExxonMobil remains well positioned to maximize long-term shareholder value. ", "And finally, I would like to mention 2 upcoming events. First, in mid- February, we will be releasing our 2011 reserves performance data. Second, as many of you have already have seen, our Analyst Meeting this year will take place at the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, March 8. This will include a live audio webcast beginning at 9:00 a.m. Eastern, 8:00 a.m. Central Time. ExxonMobil's presenters will be led by Chairman and CEO, Rex Tillerson. ", "That concludes my prepared remarks. I would now be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Arjun Murti with Goldman Sachs.", "Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Dave, 2 somewhat unrelated questions. Can you comment on the status of West Qurna and how that project is going? And then the related part of that is, can you make any comments on adding acreage in Kurdistan? There's obviously been a lot of press about that. I don't think you've put out anything officially. That was -- that's the first question.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, let me -- Arjun, let me actually answer those in reverse. I don't have any comments to make today on Kurdistan. I will, though, tell you that in the West Qurna field, things are proceeding on plan. We continue to meet our production commitments and progress the redevelopment projects in West Qurna, and that's going very well. The common sea water supply project is also progressing, and we are in the process of finalizing commercial terms with the Ministry of Oil and other participating IOCs. So things are going well and continuing to progress as planned.", "Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "The other question was just on U.S. gas. Looks like your production ticked up here in the fourth quarter. Obviously, the current gas outlook is pretty weak. You all, I know, take a longer-term view. Can you provide any comments on how you're thinking about your U.S. gas rig count and outlook and in light of what at least are currently pretty weak prices?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, thank you for that question, Arjun. That's a very topical item today, and I know there's a lot of questions and a lot of interest in the U.S. gas business and what we're seeing and what we're doing. So I might just take a moment and kind of address the broader picture of U.S. gas. I'll start by saying we remain bullish on the future of natural gas as an energy source. For those of you that are familiar with our recently released energy outlook, you know we are very bullish on the demand side of natural gas as an energy source in the U.S. And as we all know, given the fairly steep decline in conventional gas, unconventional gas will play the dominant role going forward. In that regard, we are very pleased with our unconventional resource portfolio and look forward to a major participation in that space. Now as we all know, due to record production this year and record storage levels and a relatively mild winter to date, prices have weakened significantly recently. I can tell you that we have not curtailed any gas production, and we're still running 65 to 70 rigs across the space. What has changed over the year is we have reallocated a large number of those rigs to liquids and liquids-rich plays. For example, if you were to step back a year and then come forward to today, we have actually doubled the percentage of the rigs in that fleet that are drilling either liquids or liquids-rich plays, and I mentioned some of those examples in my prepared remarks. So although the overall size of the fleet has remained about the same, a very substantial portion of that -- those rigs are drilling liquids or liquids-rich plays. Nonetheless, I can also tell you that we are still drilling dry gas wells. We do have a few of those that are required for lease maintenance or meeting other contractual obligations, but we are drilling a number that continue to provide good economics. As you would expect, with a drillable well inventory of over 40,000 wells, we're able to put those things in order and have significant optionality and flexibility to drill them, and that really gives us an opportunity to maximize the value of that resource over a long period of time. So if you look at the total market, we continue to be focused long term while making the adjustments in our rig fleet to head to the higher-value, higher-margin products.", "Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "David, just a really quick follow up, given the comments on the Cardium and some of the oil plays, do you see the opportunity to raise your overall rig count more towards the liquids and liquids-rich plays, or a 65 to 70 kind of plus or minus your number for this year?", "David S. Rosenthal", "I think as we look across the year, I wouldn't expect the 65 to 70 to change a whole lot in total. But I think it would be reasonable to expect that we will continue to expand the focus of that drilling to the liquids and the liquids-rich plays, particularly in some of the areas where we are having good initial success. And we look forward to, again, bringing on some more wells there. So I think that's what you'll see kind of as the year progresses.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "David, obviously, with these PSC effects, you've had quite a significant step-down in volumes. Thinking about your analyst meeting, I think that the 2011 number was guided to be around 4.6 million barrels a day of production. You're about 100,000 barrels a day lower than that. Should we sort of reset your trajectory of growth from that lower level, or should we think about a structurally lower level you've talked about? I guess, PSC volumes, which I guess are now lost because I assume you're blowing through tranches there. Any change in how you're handling -- or somewhat of a change in how you're handling U.S. drilling? Can you just sort of update us on the outlook for 2012? And I have a follow-up.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure, Paul. I think we'll give you a broad outlook on 2012 at the March analyst meeting, and we'll look at both this year and what the go forward. Certainly, if you look at our overall projection -- or production for the year, again, if you back out the effects, in particular on entitlements, we did, in fact, actually do a little better than the 4%. I think we had targeted 3% to 4%. So if I just look at the operational performance, we actually did as expected or perhaps even a little better than expected. As you did note, and as we note in the charts, we did see a fairly significant impact from entitlement volumes across the year. In particular, if you look year-on-year, it's about 124,000 barrels a day in total. About 100,000 of that was price-related and the other 20,000 was tranche-related as we talked about, particularly in Nigeria and Angola. So clearly, at the prices that we saw this year, we did see an impact. The prices that we were looking at and we put together our outlook back in March were a little more conservative than what we saw actually. And so that had the big effect. But we'll look forward to giving a fulsome discussion in the March analyst meeting of volumes and drivers for those going forward here again in about a month.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And just more specifically -- forgive me if I missed this in the comments, but the -- there was a large gain in asset sales in Upstream, I think with Apache. I think it's probably there was a deal with Apache in the North Sea. But could you talk about what else was sold? I'm not clear what that was.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, we had a -- that was the biggest one. The biggest impact that you saw was in the North Sea. We had some minor other things going on, but the North Sea was the biggest deal and accounted for the bulk of the asset management gain that we talked about there that you see in the other category.", "Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, so that's quite specific that it was obviously more than 50% of the number was that specific deal?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure, sure. Yes, that was the main item in that, Paul.", "Operator", "Next, we hear from Faisel Khan with Citi.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just one more time, just on the absolute gain in the quarter on the asset sales that -- because it's  -- it's $810 million year-over-year, but what's the absolute number for the quarter? And also if you can give us the absolute number for the effects that took place in Chemicals, the unfavorable tax, I think, change?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure. The absolute impact in the quarter, if you're looking on that $800 million, we had an impact of about $1 billion in the quarter was the absolute number.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, understood. And then the effect of the tax incentive or tax impact in Chemicals?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Are you interested in the full year impact or looking at the quarterly?", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just the fourth quarter.", "David S. Rosenthal", "If you look at the fourth quarter, again, relative to the prior year, that impact was really most of that $250 million that you see there. That was the bulk of it.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, got you. And then last question for me, on your -- if you could be a little more specific about the rig count in the U.S. You said you've been shifting a lot of the rigs to the liquids-rich plays. But of the 65 to 70 rigs you're running, how many of those rigs now are running in the liquids-rich plays versus the dry gas plays?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, I'll tell you, Faisel, for commercial reasons, we don't want to be that specific. I think what's important is, that it is now a substantial proportion of the total. And, again, I mentioned several examples in my prepared remarks, and you can see the increase we've had in the rigs there. So without adding all that up and giving you a total, it's been a significant increase over the last 12 months.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, then what about the lower 48 production of liquids, how has that trended? Or what number is that in the quarterly number to the volumes?", "David S. Rosenthal", "I don't think we've ever given a -- typically give a specific lower 48 number. If you look at the total in the U.S., that number has been trending about flat or so over the course, and we've seen a number of ups and downs there, but nothing real specific to highlight.", "Operator", "We'll move on to Ed Westlake with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "David, just coming back to the volumes, if I look at it year-over-year, I mean, all of it's European gas, and that's probably weathering the economy. But of that 214 of net growth, is there any other areas that you feel, as you look at the performance, that has disappointed you?", "David S. Rosenthal", "When we look across the year, in particular on the full year effect, I'll tell you one area where we did not perform quite as well as we would've expected would've been in downtime. For example, if you look at the full year downtime year-over-year was worth about 35,000 barrels a day on a decrease in a number of areas. And I'm pleased to report that as we came across the end of the year, particularly as we went from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, we actually got a lot of that back. And that was a big piece of the increase that you saw sequentially. Other than that, I think as we look across the year, all of our projects that came online performing very well. The base decline performed about as expected. The projects that came online are doing well. And overall operations were good, but I think I mentioned off and on across the year, we did have some unplanned downtime and maintenance outages, and we are working on that. I'll say scheduled downtime was about as expected, so it was clearly the unplanned outages. But again, about 35 KBD. Other than that, we're pretty pleased with how things went.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And then if I look at the cash flow, you've got $10 billion of total CapEx. You've got asset sales increasing. Should I read into this that you're going to be a little bit more aggressive about spending organically and then just perhaps selling some of the tail assets, or is it just timing in Q4 for that $10 billion run rate?", "David S. Rosenthal", "I wouldn't read anything into that. We had $10 billion in the fourth quarter. I think that was about the same as it is in the prior year. We generally see a pretty big ramp-up quarter-on-quarter as we get to the end of the year. Likewise, on divestments, and you've seen a number those announced that haven't closed yet and will as we move across this year particularly in the Downstream, I don't think there's anything special other than it's all part of our ongoing asset management program. I'll tell you, a lot of these deals are a long time in the making, some years in the making. And others come up rather quickly as the situation warrants. So no change in direction, no change of philosophy for us, again, timing and -- but we do have a continued program to look at the portfolio, add where we need to add, divest where it's favorable to us and then restructure where it meets all the stakeholders' needs. And I think you saw a lot of that over 2011. And again, many of those deals will close in the first half of this year.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I just want to make sure that I get the number right. And you're saying that the absolute asset sales gain in the Upstream is about $1 billion in the fourth quarter?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, in the fourth quarter.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And that when I looking at from the fourth to the third quarter, the other item is a positive $190 million. Does that means that in the third quarter, we have about $800 million in asset sales gain, or that there's other things in there also?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Order of magnitude, that's about right. There are some puts and takes, but that's pretty close.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "So what is the full year absolute asset sales gain? Is the $2.2 billion that you show us, either that is the number or that there's other things inside there also?", "David S. Rosenthal", "No. If you're looking at the full year number, where we show the $2.2 billion, yes, the full year for the Upstream, is about -- the delta is about $2.7 billion with an absolute of about $2.9 billion.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "All right. So absolute is about $2.9 billion in 2011? Okay.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "In Europe, the European gas is down 730 year-over-year. How much of them is related to weather? And how much is actually that their underlying capacity decline?", "David S. Rosenthal", "I think if you look at the total amount, I think about half of that is weather and the other half is decline, more or less. Clearly, sequentially, third quarter to fourth quarter, we didn't see near what we were expecting.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And I think you had mentioned -- I probably just missed that, there's a cash on deposit from the future asset sales. How much is that and related to which deal?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Paul, a good question. It's $3.6 billion that we have on deposit for potential asset sales that haven't closed. And although I won't -- don't want to give the specific details of what that relates to because, obviously, the deal hasn't closed and that means we continue to have commercial discussions going on, but I do want you to know it was there because what you have is cash without an earnings impact. And should the transactions mature and close, then you'll see an earnings effect some quarter in the future without a cash flow. But that number is $3.6 billion.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "When you suppose -- when you expected to close your deal in Japan?", "David S. Rosenthal", "By about mid-year.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Mid-year. And that until -- wondering, some of your other competitor in the Downstream, they are independent refining company that, in the quarter, they have some significant hedging losses due to using WTI to hedge for the long-haul crude supply. Wondering whether Exxon did any of that at all. Do you hedge and not in the defense for your long-haul crude supply in your Downstream? And if you do, do you use WTI or brand contracts?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Paul, that's a good question, and a pretty straightforward answer, no to all parts of that question. We don't do any hedging, and we certainly don't speculate in the futures markets.", "Operator", "Next, we'll hear from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I'm going to try a couple also, if I may. And the first one is really more of a philosophical question on your U.S. gas statements that you spent some time on earlier. We're all obviously fairly familiar with the XTO economics from the legacy portfolio. And I think it's probably fair to say that some of your dry gas production is probably challenged from a return on capital on an MPD standpoint. So has that given Exxon's focus on returns -- given the early revenue or the early dependence of those early wells on the early part of the production to basically justify the economics, at what point would Exxon consider basically zeroing out its dry gas drilling or indeed curtailing production? Is it a gas price or is it a philosophical decision that you just keep drilling right through?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Doug, I really can't comment or speculate on any forward operating decisions. The comments I made earlier really talk about where we are today and, again, the plan that I talked about in terms of what we're drilling and where we're going. But I really don't have a comment to make on what any future operating decisions that we might take.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, I thought it was worth a try, David. The second one is also a kind of philosophical question. As we look forward, and I guess you'll give us an update in March, but you have an awful lot of long-life assets that are either already in or will be in the portfolio for the next couple of years arguably stabilizing the underlying cash flow, maybe think about it another way of reducing the maintenance capital. How do you ultimately think about changing the balance between dividends and share buybacks, noting that through all your share buybacks in the last few years, your absolute dividend payment as a percentage of cash flow has actually declined fairly precipitously? How do you think about that? And I'll leave it there.", "David S. Rosenthal", "That's good. Let me hit that in a couple of areas. One, in terms of the CapEx, yes, as you know, we are in a CapEx mode now and have been for the last year or 2 and will for the next couple years, investing in large legacy projects that as we talked about before, have all of their -- or most all of their CapEx upfront. Certainly, in the last few years, the Qatar investments would qualify for that. Now the 2 Kearl oil sands projects, Morgan [ph] LNG, Papua New Guinea LNG and those sorts of things. So surely, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, a number of projects are due to come on in the 2012, 2014 time frame, and we'll begin to see both the production and cash flows from that. Without going too far beyond that, we've got a lot other opportunities we're working on as we've discussed, and we'll discuss more at the analyst meeting that we hope give us the opportunities to continue to spend CapEx in order to grow the business profitably. As you know, one of the opportunities we have, in addition to our ongoing drilling program, is the strategic cooperation agreement with Rosneft, which we are progressing and progressing as planned. And as I've mentioned in prior calls, that gives us tremendous exposure to what could be a very, very attractive opportunity. Now as far as the dividend versus share buyback, I don't have any change in our approach to communicate today. We are committed to continuing to provide a reliable and growing stable dividend to our shareholders. And then once we've invested in all the attractive projects and opportunities we have available, returning a lot of the cash to the shareholders through share repurchases. So that's a long-term kind of approach we've taken over the last many years. And I would expect, going forward, although we continue to look at that all the time every quarter, I don't have any change to communicate today.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Terreson with ISI Group.", "Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "In the Downstream, between sales in Malaysia, I think, was in Q3 and then Japan and consolidation of fuels marketing and lubes, restructuring is become fairly, fairly meaningful in refining and marketing. And so my question regards the strategic rationale behind these moves, and whether you consider these actions is normal course of business or maybe more. And either way, do you know the productivity benefits that the company expects to realize from these actions?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, that's a good question. I'll say, it's really part of an ongoing program we've had in the Downstream for a long time as opposed to any specific change in strategy or event. We, like others, have been looking at our Downstream assets around the world. And where we have had areas where, in certain locations, that our assets are of significantly more value to others, we've actually sold those businesses. The resulting impact has been very positive on our returns in the Downstream, and so we continue to progress and look at those things. We've about finished up the retail conversion in the U.S. and that has gone on very well, and the earnings associated with those divestments have been very strong. As you mentioned, a couple of the other sales that we have out there in Malaysia, in Argentina and Central America that we announced last year, should close some time in the first quarter or second quarter of this year. And then the Japan restructuring that we mentioned here in the last couple of days, we should also close again by mid-year. So -- but taking all that into account, we do continue to invest in the business where it makes sense, the ultra-low sulfur diesel investments that we've made in the last couple of years. I mentioned some additional lower-sulfur and cleaner-burning fuel projects that are underway, as well as, of course, the chemicals projects that we have underway. So we remain committed to these businesses. But again, as we said in our outlook for energy, in certain parts of the world, the demand for transportation of fuels is flat to down, and I would expect us to optimize there. And where we have opportunities for growth, we will. But I would say, overall, if you look over the last couple of years and kind of what's out there now, it's been a very successful asset management program, and we're very pleased with it. But it is an opportunistic program, and I don't have any guidance going forward other than the deals we got there to close.", "Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, I follow. So -- and also, in U.S. E&P, profitability has been a little soft over the past couple of quarters. And I realize that natural gas prices have been weak, but crude oil performed pretty well. And so my question is whether you could comment on the cost trend that you're experiencing in U.S. E&P and/or any other color that you can provide on U.S. E&P profitability.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure. Certainly, on the overall unit margin or unit profitability, we are, of course, impacted by the decline in gas prices. And while we do intend to give a nice update in March on the unconventional business in the U.S., I can tell you that some of the objectives we set out at the time of the merger are coming to fruition. We are seeing improvement in capital efficiency. We are seeing reductions in operating expense. We're seeing improved productivity on the wells through a number of things, everything from pad spacing to length of laterals to how we array the laterals in certain areas. So a number of both engineering and technology. Things we've brought to the table are paying off, and I think that helps mitigate the impact of the lower expenses or the lower prices, if you will. So from that standpoint, I think we're progressing well and optimizing again that portfolio. But at the end of the day, the profitability on a book basis is certainly impacted by the declining price trend that we've seen over the course of the year.", "Operator", "We'll move on to Robert Kessler with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.", "Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "One quick clarification on the U.S. natural gas commentary and then also on the unconventional liquids. So on U.S. natural gas, with your unchanged bullish long-term outlook, any thoughts on being a continued consolidator in the U.S. E&P space? And then on the unconventional liquids, thanks for the color and activity there in the different areas. Can you provide some maybe IP rates? And if I can sort of shoot for the moon, well specific costs on the areas you highlighted?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, sure, let me hit those 2 questions. In terms of the first question, I don't have any specific guidance, but as we have said for a long time, I will continue to say we are always looking for opportunities that are out there and you've seen that in some of the acquisitions that we've made over the last year or so. We continue to look at opportunities. Certainly, as the environment changes over time, we're always checking to see what's available and what might be of value to us. But again, no specifics. In terms of the individual IP rates, I don't have any specifics to give you. I will say that if you look, for example, up in the Cardium, where some of the tight oil well rates that you've heard from others, ours are certainly doing well and at the upper end of that range. We're getting good rates in the Woodford Ardmore. We're looking forward to some of the other ones. But again, a lot of our drilling has been delineation in nature, and we have yet to bring a lot of those wells on production. So I wouldn't want to give specifics other than to just conclude and say, that program is going well, and we're very optimistic, and again, in particular, the Bakken, the Cardium and the Woodford Ardmore are all looking very attractive, and I look forward to giving you more update on those areas as this year progresses.", "Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. If I could ask one quick clarification on the Downstream, you mentioned the benefit of inventory liquidation. It sounds like you blew through a couple of LIFO liquidation layers. Any quantification that benefit to earnings more explicitly and then any kind of strategy around liquidation of inventories around year end, ad valorem tax purposes for example, or is this just kind of an inherent volatility in the inventory balances?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, I'll tell you, you didn't see a real big change. I'll tell you the absolute inventory. The LIFO effect for this year in the fourth quarter was $200 million. And frankly, that's about what it was last year. So we didn't see much of a change in any of our businesses, about $200 million. But again, no big shift in program. That's kind of typical as we optimize our inventories at year end.", "Operator", "Next, we'll hear from Jason Gammel with Macquarie.", "Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research", "I just wanted to ask really for an update on some of the other unconventional activity that weren't mentioned in the discussion. So I'll hold it to one, but it's going to be multi-part, if that's okay. First of all, Utica Shale, have you actually spud a well there yet? And are you -- so an acreage position around 75,000, or have you increased that?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure. As I mentioned, we would be spudding a well in the first quarter of this year, and we do have one going down as we speak. The acreage position there is about 75,000 acres today, and we're looking forward to working on that.", "Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research", "Great. And then on the Horn River Basin, David, can you talk about what activity levels are like during this particular drilling campaign and if you have advanced any strategy towards potentially exporting that gas as LNG?", "David S. Rosenthal", "I'll hit the first one. We are. We do have a drilling program planned for this year. I think it'll be about the same as we had last year. And again, it's really related to evaluation and delineation as opposed to production, so a similar size program. And it's going to be -- I think it'll be about 2 wells, 2 to 3 wells, which is typically what we've been doing. In terms of strategies for eventual monetization, I don't have any specific information to provide other than, of course, with a resource potentially as large as that, we are exploring all of the options that are out there, and we'll continue to do so. And as soon as I have an update on that, I'll give it to you. I might also mention the Neuquen Basin. I think I mentioned it briefly in my prepared remarks. We do have 2 wells going down there. They are not completed yet, so I can't give you any specifics. But we continue to add acreage down there and looking forward to an active drilling program and really trying to test the potential for both liquids and gas. So that is active. Another country that we've talked about before is Poland, and I think I mentioned in the last call that we would have had the 2 wells down in Poland. Those 2 wells did complete in the fourth quarter. And while we did find gas, it did not flow in commercial quantities in either of those 2 wells, so we'll be analyzing that, evaluating the various characteristics of the shale there and working on our go-forward plans. I think that's kind of an update. If there's a country I missed that you're interested in, I'd be happy to talk about it.", "Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research", "Maybe just as a follow-up, David, what is the condition of the service industry in Argentina? Are you able to find rigs and pressure pumping equipment, or are things really tight? And then I'll leave it at that.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes. In Argentina, we're doing okay. We have a -- we farmed into a block there, and the operator there is pretty well established. So at least for the activity that we have ongoing and the wells that we're trying to drill, it's not impacting our program. But we'll see how that turns out as we go forward and the activity in the area increases in general.", "Operator", "Allen Good with Morningstar has our next question.", "Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Most of my questions have been answered. I just had a quick one. I know you said the reserve report was coming out in February. But could you give us any indication if any reserves from Iraq were booked this year or anything else related more to Kearl given the go ahead with the expansion there?", "David S. Rosenthal", "No, I think I'll wait and we'll, of course, talk about both of those, but both of those will be included in our press release. And it'll be out in mid-February, so we're only a couple of weeks away.", "Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just one quick follow-up on Kashagan. Is that still on schedule for this year? And any update you could give there would be helpful.", "David S. Rosenthal", "I think the target is still for year-end this year, and I don't have any update for you different than that.", "Operator", "Next, we'll hear from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.", "Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "One quick one about -- back to U.S. gas. With 18 months having passed since you closed XTO, has the employee attrition rate been consistent with your expectations prior to closing?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Well, yes. In fact, that's turned out to be a pretty positive for us. It's been very stable. We haven't seen any significant increase. And on that front, things are pretty good. I think the folks over there are very pleased with the progress we're making in the business, in the program, the integration, the availability of technology and other resources to advance the programs that were under way. And so, again, that's been a positive for us.", "Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then a quick one about Japan. The transaction with TonenGeneral, was that brought about by Exxon proactively, or were you approached by the buyer in this deal who was interested in making this happen? Or just can you tell us a little bit about the background to that deal?", "David S. Rosenthal", "I really can't share any specifics along those lines. I can tell you, when you look at the restructuring and the assets involved and how they're structured and managed today and how they will be after the deal, this is a positive for all the stakeholders involved and really better positions that combined business to meet the market needs of Japan. And I think that's probably the most important part without getting into specifics about how it was initiated.", "Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Will Exxon have any wholly owned refineries in Japan after this closes?", "David S. Rosenthal", "No, we won't.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Philip Weiss with Argus Research.", "Philip Weiss - Argus Research Company", "I just have one -- most of my questions have been answered, but I do have one follow-up on U.S. You said that the rig count that's being used for liquids-rich is rising. But when I look at production, natural gas, as a percentage of your total production, has grown and liquids has actually fallen a little bit. So I wonder if you could just comment on when we might start to see that trend change.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure. The falloff in the liquids is really just the overall decline in the conventional, as well as some divestments. You'll recall, we had a divestment in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and that had an impact on us year-over-year and particularly in the second half. In terms of when we'll see significant production growth out of the unconventional, a lot -- I mentioned some of the increases in percentages, although we haven't given all the specific production volumes, but we'll do that as we progress. One of the things we've seen is a lot of the drilling is really around delineating the resource and appraising it, finding where the sweet spots are, determining what the best approach to frac-ing or otherwise producing those resources, a lot of time being spent on evaluating well spacing. So I think the best way to think about this is a lot of activity and a lot of drilling and a lot of planning as opposed to being in a huge hurry to get a well on production and over to sales. But clearly, as that program advances this year and we continue to put in the wells and the infrastructure, we would expect to see those volumes increase at a fairly hefty rate. And again, we'll talk a little bit more about the overall program and what to expect at the meeting we have in March.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Herrlin with Societe Generale.", "John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research", "Just some quick ones. For the Woodford Cana, what's your split do you know between gas and liquids?", "David S. Rosenthal", "In the Woodford Ardmore?", "John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research", "Yes. I'm sorry, yes. Sorry, yes.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, the -- I don't have a specific split number on that. I think what's more important as opposed to specific production is the emergence and the discovery, really, in the Ardmore Basin of the liquids potential. I'll tell you, if you were thinking about rigs in particular on that, we've got 8 rigs drilling liquids and 2 rigs drilling gas, if that was the real nature of the -- of your question. And so, again, early mover in there on our part over the last year or so and really looking forward to ramping up the activity there.", "John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research", "Okay. With many of the U.S. liquids plays you, spoke of being in a delineation mode. Does that mean you're having to deal with HBP acreage capture issues, or you're just trying to get a sense of field sizes?", "David S. Rosenthal", "No, it's not really the HBP capture. It's really figuring out what we've got and what the best way is to go about developing and producing it so that we optimize the total over a long period of time as opposed to, again, being in a big hurry. It's -- if you think about it, it's what's the field size and the acreage position that we have, where are the sweet spots, and then where do you go first and then how do you develop that to optimally produce. And we do -- I will say, we probably spend a little more time than others working on the front-end design and evaluation because, again, we're focused on what the overall long-term value is we can get out of that. And that's kind of the upfront investment in time and resources that we've seen here over the last year. I guess the last thing I'll mention is, even as we're doing some of these delineation and appraisal wells, even that, we find some fairly significant efficiency gains as we go from one area to the other and then capturing those allow us once we get to really producing the resource. We're not starting out from scratch. We've already got some experience. So again, more to that as the year progresses.", "John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research", "Okay. In terms of going from a delineation mode to development mode, how long do you think that will take before you get your comfort level to reach that sort of level or degree of planning?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Well, I think it depends on the various areas and the resources. Some we've had efforts underway for a while now, and some, we're just starting -- really getting things underway, and it'll vary. But again, I think what you'll find as the year progresses, I'll give you updates as we progress and really get to kind of the production level because it will be different amongst the various fields.", "Operator", "Next, we'll hear from Katherine Minyard with JPMorgan.", "Katherine Lucas Minyard - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just a couple of quick ones. What's the -- as we kind of look at ExxonMobil's portfolio in North American natural gas, what's the usage been over either 2011 or the fourth quarter just in terms of consumption at the refinery and even the oil sands level?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Kate, I don't have those specific numbers. I can tell you, directionally, in the U.S., one of the benefits we got out of the merger with XTO was an ability to optimize gas feeds into all of our refineries along the Gulf Coast and optimizing feed into there versus sales to third parties. So I don't have those specific rates, but I can tell you, we've been able to optimize that to the benefit of our refining economics. Additionally, we've been able to also, through integration, optimize our feeds, both natural gas for utilities, as well as ethane into the Chemical business. So that's ongoing. And probably, if you talk about integration, that's probably more important than anything that we have going on up in the oil sands space, so a clear benefit and one we're taking advantage of.", "Katherine Lucas Minyard - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just switching gears to the cash position. When we think about ExxonMobil's potential uses of cash over the next, say, year or so, should we be considering potential underfunded pension liabilities as a use of cash? I can appreciate that maybe at the year-end 2011, they didn't completely finalize. But is that something that might be on the table as it's been in years past?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Again, I think they're still sorting through all of that, and I think we'll publish that number when the K comes out here in a little while. But I'm not aware of anything significant on the table relative to what we've seen historically.", "Operator", "Next, we'll hear from Mark Gilman with The Benchmark Company.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division", "Just couple, if I could. You mentioned in your prepared remarks asset sales gains in the Downstream. Could you quantify that on an absolute basis in the quarter?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure. It was about $200 million.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. It's been indicated in the trades that you are in arrears, or I should say, Baghdad is in arrears to the tune of $500-odd million on West Qurna. Can you comment on the validity of that?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Mark, I really can't comment specifically on the items that you mentioned, particularly in the trade press. What I can tell you is, we have an ongoing relationship with the Ministry on a number of administrative items. But things are -- we're working through that, but I don't have any specific on any one item. We work on issues from procurement to invoicing to payment to a number of things, and those are ongoing.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, I was curious about the Tonen transaction. 22%, kind of an odd number in terms of your retained interest in Tonen. Can you give me some idea how that number came about and, well, why it is that you would want to retain a 22% interest?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, I can tell you, the 22% is -- represents the 80 million shares that we're keeping in the business. I can tell you, again, the whole transaction is really around optimizing the commercial structure in Japan. And when we looked at the various restructuring and consolidations and optimization of the assets in there, that's where we ended up. And it really represents -- we're not -- we're still committed to Japan. You'll see a large presence of ExxonMobil in there. All of our brands will be in there. We'll continue to provide services and technology. But it's really just -- I think, if you looked at the Japan market and how it's evolving, that restructuring was really kind of a natural next step in the integration of those assets and again, will position the combined company to better meet the needs of the market and add value for the stakeholders.", "Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Last one for me. You've got some license renewals coming up in Abu Dhabi, you and others in the consortium. I think the expiration of those licenses is 2014. In your case, in particular, is there any linkage between these -- the potential renewal of those licenses and the terms under which they get renewed and your Upper Zakum project?", "David S. Rosenthal", "We are involved in commercial discussions that are ongoing. But, Mark, I think as you can appreciate, I really couldn't comment on anything that had to do with the negotiations there or any of the specifics with fiscal terms or anything else. ", "Thank you, Mark, and thanks to everybody for being on the call today. Appreciate your time and questions and look forward to visiting with you at the March analyst meeting. So thank you very much.", "Operator", "That does conclude today's conference call.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings call and webcast. The focus of this call is ExxonMobil's financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2012. I will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. ", "Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our customary cautionary statement shown on Slide 2. ", "Moving to Slide 3. We provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global economic growth slowed in the first quarter, primarily due to continued contraction in the European Union. The U.S. and Japanese economies are also expected to show declines from fourth quarter levels. China growth, while still robust, was also lower in the first quarter. ", "Energy markets were mixed in the first quarter, with higher crude oil and non-U.S. natural gas prices. Industry refining margins also improved from the fourth quarter. While U.S. chemical margins remained strong, Europe and Asia continued at near bottom-of-cycle conditions. ", "Turning now to the first quarter financial results as shown on Slide 4. ExxonMobil's first quarter 2012 earnings, excluding special items, were $9.5 billion, a decrease of $1.2 billion from the first quarter of 2011. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 49%. Earnings per share for the quarter, excluding special items, were $2, down $0.14 from a year ago. ", "Corporation distributed more than $7 billion to shareholders in the first quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. ", "Of that total, $5 billion was distributed to purchase shares. Through the end of the first quarter 2012, we have repurchased the number of shares issued for XTO, and total shares outstanding are now lower than they were prior to the acquisition. ", "Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share, a 21% increase from the last quarter. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $5 million in the second quarter of 2012, unchanged from last quarter. CapEx in the first quarter was $8.8 billion, up 13% from the first quarter of 2011. ", "Across our diverse portfolio, we continued to invest in robust projects through the business cycle to help meet global demand for crude oil, natural gas and finished products while supporting economic growth, including job creation. Our cash generation remains strong, $21.8 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales. At the end of the first quarter of 2012, cash totaled $19.1 billion and debt was $15.7 billion. ", "The next slide provides additional detail on first quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter, cash increased from $13.1 billion to $19.1 billion, including cash on deposit associated with asset sales which have not yet closed and therefore are not yet reflected in earnings. The combined impact of strong earnings, depreciation expense, lower working capital and the benefit of our ongoing asset management program yielded $21.8 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included additions to plant, property and equipment or PP&E, $7.8 billion and shareholder distributions of $7.2 billion. Additional financing and investing activities decreased our cash by $0.8 billion. ", "Moving on to Slide 6 and a review of our segmented results. ExxonMobil's first quarter 2012 earnings of $9.5 billion decreased $1.2 billion or 11% from the first quarter of 2011. Upstream earnings decreased $873 million, while downstream earnings improved by $487 million. Chemical earnings were down $815 million. ", "Corporate and financing expenses were flat. Corporate and financing expenses remain within our continued guidance of $500 million to $700 million per quarter. As shown on Slide 7, ExxonMobil's first quarter 2012 earnings were essentially flat compared with the fourth quarter of 2011. ", "Moving next to the first quarter business highlights beginning on Slide 8. We continue to advance our global portfolio of high-quality projects. The Kearl Initial Development project is now 90% complete and is on schedule to start up later this year, with initial gross production of approximately 110,000 barrels per day. The initial fleet of haul trucks and shovels are on site and assembled, and all pipelines are mechanically complete. ", "In Angola, the Kizomba Satellites project remains on schedule for a mid-2012 startup, with peak capacity of 100,000 gross barrels of oil per day. The development design will optimize the capabilities of existing facilities, allowing for increased production levels without the investment in an additional floating production, storage and offloading vessel. Onshore fabrication is complete, while FPSO modifications and subsea pipeline installation are expected to finish in the second quarter. ", "In Nigeria, we completed construction of 3 wellhead platforms as part of the Nigeria Satellites project. The structures are currently being moved to the field site for installation. These are the first offshore platform structures to be fully constructed in Nigeria. The project is on schedule to start up in late 2012, with peak capacity of 70,000 gross barrels per day. Also in Nigeria, the Usan deepwater development achieved first oil in February and has a production capacity of 180,000 gross barrels per day. ", "In Russia, construction is complete on the Arkutun-Dagi gravity-based structure, with float-out scheduled for later this year. The project remains on schedule for startup in 2014. ", "In March, ExxonMobil, along with our partners, finalized the settlement agreement with the state of Alaska regarding the Point Thomson unit, which enables the progression of the initial development phase of the Point Thomson project. The settlement agreement sets out the near-term development plan for the Point Thomson field. The initial production system will include processing capacity of 200 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and 10,000 barrels of condensate per day. ", "Detailed engineering and purchasing of long lead equipment is currently underway. Pending approval of the draft environmental impact statement and other required permits, startup of the initial phase at Point Thomson is anticipated in the first quarter of 2016. Alaska's North Slope holds more than 35 trillion cubic feet of discovered natural gas, and Point Thomson is a key component to the development of this resource. ", "Turning now to Slide 9. We continue to make progress on our strategic cooperation with Rosneft. Earlier this month, Rosneft and ExxonMobil signed a series of agreements to implement the long-term Strategic Cooperation Agreement that our companies announced last August. The execution of these foundation agreements for our joint venture with Rosneft establishes the key terms for our cooperative exploration and development of the Kara Sea and the Black Sea. ", "President-elect Putin also recently announced fiscal terms to encourage offshore development in Russia. These improved terms eliminate the export tax and lower the mineral extraction tax. Fiscal terms will be fixed at 15 years for the Kara Sea and 10 years for the Black Sea deepwater. ", "In addition, we commenced joint exploration activities in the Black Sea. Our seismic acquisition is now nearing completion. We are also planning for seismic acquisition in the Kara Sea for later this year. We expect to begin exploration drilling in the 2014 to 2015 time frame as soon as prospect mapping is complete and a rig is contracted. ", "Additionally, Rosneft will take equity in promising exploration and development projects in the United States and Canada, including the La Escalera Ranch project in the Delaware Basin in West Texas and equity in the Harmattan acreage in the Cardium play of the western Canada basin in Alberta. Rosneft also has the opportunity to acquire a 30% interest in 20 blocks in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In addition, Rosneft and ExxonMobil will jointly study tight oil production technologies in western Siberia. ", "Turning now to deepwater exploration on Slide 10. ExxonMobil maintains a diverse and robust global deepwater portfolio which supports an active drilling program aimed at testing new play concepts, exploiting opportunities in proven basins and drilling near-field wildcats. For example, in Romania, we drilled a successful deepwater play test on the Neptune block in the Black Sea with the Deepwater Champion drillship. Following this encouraging play test, we are planning additional 3-D seismic data acquisition to support future drilling opportunities on the block. ", "We also participated in an exploration well offshore Tanzania in the first quarter, which discovered approximately 5 TCF of recoverable gas in a high-quality reservoir. A second exploration well is planned for second quarter 2012 to test another prospect on the block. ", "We also maintain an active global unconventional exploration drilling program as discussed on Slide 11. In North America, we hold a material position in multiple unconventional plays across 8 million acres, and we continue to increase our lease holdings in emerging liquids-rich plays, like the Woodford Ardmore. Our acreage position in the Woodford Ardmore play tripled in 2011 to more than 170,000 acres, with acquisition costs on a per-acre basis roughly 50% below major industry acquisitions in the Eagle Ford play. ", "In the first quarter, we entered into an agreement to purchase an additional 58,000 acres through a strategic acquisition, which will increase our total acreage position to more than 230,000 acres. This will further expand our position in a play where we already hold 170,000 net acres, with an estimated potential to recover 600 million oil equivalent barrels at an attractive unit development cost of approximately $10 per barrel. We continue to focus drilling activity to maximize the development of this liquids-rich play with 10 operated rigs. Current drilling is focused on delineating the acreage, as well as determining optimal well spacing and drilling and completion practices. ", "We also hold a large heritage position in tight oil plays in western Canada, including the Cardium and Viking plays. We are actively drilling in the Cardium and achieved first oil production in the fourth quarter of 2011. We are currently drilling in the Viking and have additional drilling planned this year to further delineate this tight oil resource. ", "Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results and starting on Slide 12. Upstream earnings in the first quarter were $7.8 billion, down $873 million from the first quarter of 2011. Stronger crude oil and non-U.S. natural gas realizations increased earnings by approximately $1.3 billion, as  crude oil realizations increased by more than $13 a barrel, and non-U.S. average gas realizations increased $1.27 per thousand cubic feet. ", "However, positive effects resulting from the increase in realizations were mitigated by a higher effective tax rate. The decrease in U.S. natural gas realizations of $1.25 per thousand cubic feet also negatively impacted earnings by more than $300 million. Production mix and volume effects decreased earnings by $850 million, due mainly to the impact of lower entitlement volumes in West Africa, base decline and divestments, partly offset by the ramp-up of Angola and Iraq projects. ", "Earnings were also negatively impacted by the unfavorable timing of liftings, as we were underlifted in higher-margin areas, such as the North Sea and West Africa. All other items, primarily the absence of gains from asset divestments, combined with higher exploration and operating expenses, decreased earnings by $1 billion. Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel for the first quarter of 2012 were $18.83, reflecting the unfavorable mix impacts and higher effective tax rate. ", "Moving to Slide 13. Oil equivalent volumes decreased by more than 5% from the first quarter of last year, mainly due to the impact of lower entitlement volumes in West Africa, decline and divestments. Volumes were positively impacted by the ramp-up of projects in Angola and Iraq and less downtime. Excluding the impact of higher prices on entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production was down about 1%. ", "Turning now to Slide 14. First quarter operational performance was consistent with plans, including the successful startup of the Nigeria Usan development. Additional project startups expected in the second half of the year, including Angola Satellites, Nigeria Satellites and the Kearl Initial Development project, are key to achieving our 2012 volumes outlook. Although seasonal factors, including demand and the timing of planned maintenance activities, will impact volume profiles during the year, we expect full year volume performance to be consistent with our March outlook. ", "Turning now to the sequential comparison starting on Slide 15. Upstream earnings decreased by $1 billion versus the fourth quarter of 2011. Stronger crude oil realizations and non-U.S. natural gas realizations positively impacted earnings by more than $300 million, as crude oil realizations increased by more than $7 per barrel and non-U.S. average gas realizations increased $0.26 per thousand cubic feet. ", "However, positive effects resulting from the increase in realizations were mitigated by a higher effective tax rate. A decrease in U.S. natural gas realizations of $0.70 per thousand cubic feet also negatively impacted earnings by $170 million. Production and mix effects, mainly higher natural gas volumes from stronger seasonal demand in Europe, increased earnings by $100 million. Earnings were negatively impacted, however, by the unfavorable timing of liftings as we were underlifted in higher-margin West Africa. Other items, primarily the absence of gains from asset divestments, decreased earnings by more than $1.2 billion. ", "Moving to Slide 16. Oil equivalent volumes were up slightly from the fourth quarter of 2011 as the impact of lower entitlement volumes in West Africa and divestments were more than offset by stronger seasonal gas demand in Europe. Excluding the impact of higher prices on entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production was up almost 3%. For further data on regional volumes, please refer to the press release and IR supplement. ", "Moving now to the Downstream financial and operating results and starting on Slide 17. Downstream earnings in the first quarter were $1.6 billion, up $487 million from the first quarter of 2011. Margin effects decreased earnings by $40 million. Continued benefits from our refining optimization activities contributed to the positive $210 million in volume and mix effects. Other factors, primarily higher gains on asset sales, increased earnings by $320 million. ", "Moving to Slide 18. Sequentially, first quarter Downstream earnings increased by $1.2 billion. Improved industry refining margins contributed increased earnings of $840 million. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $70 million. Other factors increased earnings by $390 million, largely due to higher gains on asset sales and favorable foreign exchange effects. ", "Turning now to the Chemical financial and operating results and starting on Slide 19. First quarter Chemical earnings were $701 million, a decrease of $815 million versus the first quarter of 2011. Lower margins decreased earnings by $520 million, especially in Asia Pacific and Europe, while volumes and mix effects were flat. Other factors decreased earnings by $300 million, reflecting higher planned maintenance expense and the absence of favorable tax items. ", "Moving to Slide 20.  Sequentially, first quarter Chemical earnings increased by $158 million, driven by stronger demand for specialty products. Margin effects increased earnings by $50 million. Volume and mix increased earnings by $60 million, while all other items increased earnings a total of $50 million. While the first quarter continued to show cyclical weakness in Europe and Asia margins, ExxonMobil continues to leverage feed advantage, integration, cost discipline and premium product offerings to strongly position us throughout the Chemical business cycle. ", "Moving to Slide 21. ExxonMobil's first quarter financial and operating performance was strong. It reflects the ability of our business model and competitive advantages to deliver strong results. As we continue to focus on operational excellence, deploy high-impact technologies and leverage our unparalleled global integration, ExxonMobil remains well positioned to maximize long-term shareholder value. ", "That concludes my prepared remarks this morning. I would now be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Doug Terreson with ISI Group.", "Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "My question's on the big increase in the dividend. And specifically, at the analyst meeting, Rex seemed pretty clear that a more balanced approach to distributions might be forthcoming. But on this point, the size of the increase represents a fairly marked departure from the 6% to 7% annualized growth rate you guys have provided over 5, 10, and I think, even 15 years. So my question's whether or not you could provide some color on this change and specifically, how we should consider it in the context of overall dividend policy at ExxonMobil.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, Doug, that's an excellent question given our announcement yesterday. Let me kind of start with your last comment and move backwards from there. We really had no change in our dividend policy. The policy remains the same, as does our total allocation of cash generated by the business. We do have a continued trend in dividend increases as we have said before. If you go back over a long history of the company, we have, in other quarters, had fairly significant dividend increases. So again, no change in policy. But as we said at the analyst meeting, we are always evaluating the dividend policy and our cash distributions and studying how things are going. And the board decided yesterday to make the increase they did. But you also notice that our share repurchases remained at the $5 billion level that you saw across last year. So I would say the strategy remains the same, invest in that very robust investment program we have, and you saw our first quarter CapEx, very strong as those projects proceed, have a continuously growing dividend and then take the balance of the cash and buy the shares. And that policy and strategy, I think, continues on.", "Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And let me just ask you one more question. There's been a lot of crosscurrents about the position in Iraq and specifically Exxon's current license, the strategy in Kurdistan and eligibility and/or interest on the upcoming licensing round. And so could you provide an update on that position, which covers these items, to the degree possible, David?", "David S. Rosenthal", "I really can't comment a lot on that other than just say the contracts that we have in place and it's our intent to honor and fulfill those contractual obligations. I will note in the South, we reached another milestone at West Qurna, where production has reached right at 400,000 barrels a day, and we're very pleased how that effort is coming along and the progress we're making there. We continue to develop the field and do the things that we committed to do, and so progress continues. But other than that, I really wouldn't have any further comments.", "Operator", "And now we'll hear from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I have a couple, also, if I may. You mentioned on your prepared remarks about the higher E&P tax rate. I'm wondering if you could just give us a little bit of color as to why that was, if it was just mix effects and what the driver was. And in the context of the same issue, you also mentioned underlifts in the international portfolio. It's unusual for you to mention that, I guess. To the extent that it was material, could you quantify that for us, either absolute or on a per barrel basis?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure, I'd be happy to do -- answer both of those, Doug. First of all, I'll start with the tax rate. You got the right word. You said mix. We have -- and it's a number of mix effects that we saw across the first quarter. One of those that kind of goes unmentioned is really the difference in a lot of the crude prices around the world. People tend to focus in on Brent and WTI. There was a lot of variability. For example, the Middle East crudes tended to do better than those markers. Some of the Canadian crudes, particularly the heavier crudes, tended to do less. You also have different fiscal regimes in each of these countries. And frankly, we saw some of the highest realization increases in countries with higher tax rates and some of the lower-than-average increases or even decreases in countries with lower tax rates. So the mix -- that mix there and then the corresponding mix of where your earnings were generated that uptick in this quarter on the tax rate. Let me talk about the underlifts. They were a factor this quarter, so maybe I'll go ahead and give some specifics here. In the first quarter of 2012, on a absolute basis, we were underlifted about 45,000 barrels a day. Last year, in the first quarter we were actually overlifted by about 18,000 barrels a day, though the delta quarter-on-quarter was about 63,000 barrels a day. All of that underlift was in either West Africa or the North Sea, which tend to be some of our higher-margin areas. The impact was actually, quarter-on-quarter, a little bit bigger sequentially, so let me provide those numbers to you. Again, on an absolute basis, we were 45,000 barrels a day underlifted in the first quarter. As I mentioned last quarter, we were actually overlifted about 37,000 barrels a day. You might recall across last year, we talked about kind of quarter-to-quarter, we were a little underlifted and we made a bunch of that up at the end of the year. So if you take the 45,000, we were underlifted in the first quarter and the 37,000 we were overlifted in the fourth quarter. Sequentially, we were down about 82,000 barrels a day. And again, all of that was in West Africa. So it's a bit unusual that you have that level of a lifting timing effect, but it did occur in the first quarter. And as you would guess by doing the math, did have an impact on our reported earnings.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "David, would you be able to quantify the net income impact? Or is that not something you want to get into?", "David S. Rosenthal", "No, I don't have the net income effect on that. But again, as I mentioned, those are some of our higher-margin barrels, and you can probably use your own estimates and come up with a number. But I don't have one for you today.", "Operator", "Moving on, we'll go to Robert Kessler with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company.", "Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Congratulations again on the Rosneft exploration JV. I wanted to go back to that for a minute. Your recent presentation and that of Rosneft highlighted or focused extensively on the oil prospectivity of the Kara Sea. So what about gas? By that, I mean estimates from, say, the USGS and others place more discoverable gas potential in the area than oil. To the extent that you discover natural gas, do the agreements contemplate and does the fiscal structure allow for economic development of the gas?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Well, that's an excellent question, and I'm glad you highlighted, to begin with, the progress we made because we really have made substantial progress. I think in the meeting we had last week, the term historic was actually used, and so we're very pleased as are our partners in Rosneft with the progress that we've made. I know there's a number of estimates out there in terms of the prospectivity in the Kara Sea. I think I've seen some different ones, the one you've mentioned. I think WoodMac has some numbers out there. Clearly, there's oil and gas potential out there. I don't think we know yet how to assess that, and really, that process is just getting underway. I really, in terms, so -- but again, as we said at the meeting, we are highly encouraged by the prospectivity on the oil side because of the extension of the prolific West Siberia basin plays that are already in existence and are already producing, so that's what kind of lends  that. Looking forward, it's really premature to start discussing the contract details or arrangements or fiscal terms and that sort of stuff in detail. I would just point out, again, for those on the call that aren't as familiar, the Kara -- our position in the Kara Sea is equivalent in size to basically the North Sea and all of the leased acreage in the Gulf of Mexico. So again, a huge area of land, over 30 million acres, highly prospective. But again, under some rather harsh conditions, a challenging environment to work in and will require all of the technological and operational capabilities of the 2 partners to explore that resource and should it be successful, to then exploit those resources and move forward with development and production. We have a lot of experience in the Arctic, even in Russia. And again, if you just kind of look at the parameters and the vectors, we're encouraged by the progress. We're certainly excited and looking forward to the joint venture, as are our partners and in particular, as I mentioned, getting the seismic activity underway and preparing to drill our first wells here in the next 2 to 3 years.", "Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "The scenario that was presented in terms of potential FID date and potential first production, both of those were presuming this was an oil discovery that would be made. Is that right?", "David S. Rosenthal", "I think that's generally correct. Again, though, I would just caution on looking forward. There's a lot of work to do, a lot of effort to be done here, and so I don't want to really start getting into specifics about FID dates and production and that sort of thing other than to say the schedule that we have in front of us, which is really getting that seismic underway this year, developing that drillable prospect inventory, siting that first well and getting that well done in what industry perspective-wise would be a fairly short time frame. So again, we're going after it aggressively. But this is true frontier exploration, and we'll certainly be disciplined and diligent in our approach. And, again, it is early days, so I think we'll focus a little more on the prospectivity and potential and a little less on what some of those specific dates might be in the outer years.", "Operator", "Morgan Stanley's Evan Calio has our next questions.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "A question on Kearl. I appreciate your comments and then progress update. I know you guys have secured a transportation solution, but can you provide more color on the planned route to market so we can better understand potential relative realizations versus waterborne crudes? I know you mentioned earlier they're -- they've been quite lower than others.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, if we're thinking about the initial phase, the first phase that's coming on this year, I can tell you we already have placement for that first page -- first phase, I'm sorry, so it's not an issue. We have multiple options within our own refining circuit to begin with, as well as some other options. But basically, we're looking to place those first barrels with existing infrastructure and routes. And again, the bulk of that will likely find its way within our own system, but we have some other options. I think what's important to know is that we can start up Kearl, take it up to its full initial production of 110,000 barrels a day without any concerns over logistical constraints.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, good. And secondly, on Argentina, I mean, have your plans, pace of activity or thoughts changed at all in Argentina following the YPF nationalization? I know you have almost a 900,000-acre position and curious to see how you're thinking or kind of accounting for any potential investment risk there.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure. Let me start out by saying that our position, ExxonMobil and our activity down there has not been affected by some of the recent activities that you mentioned that have occurred down there. Our activity, our exploration activity, is continuing. In fact, I can tell you in the first quarter, we did complete our first 2 wells and get those down. We're in the process here in the second quarter of frac-ing those wells, and we'll be testing them in the second quarter, so those plans continue, and the objectives are being met. As you mentioned, we have a very large acreage position there. We're encouraged by the early results that we're seeing down there and look forward to profitably moving on with that venture. Having said that, of course, we are monitoring events that are occurring down there and what's happening, and we'll take all of that into consideration. But as we sit here today, we're meeting the objectives we set for the year, and plans are continuing. And again, we have a very long, successful history in Argentina and going forward, got a great set of acreage down there. And again, we continue to work on that per our plan coming into the year.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Have you had [ph] contact with the government and have some confirmation? Or is there any update on dialogue going there of your importance to the development of that resource?", "David S. Rosenthal", "I don't have anything specific to identify. Obviously, in any country where we have a lot of activity going on and investments, we're always in contact, in dialogue with the appropriate government agencies, as well as our partners. So I wouldn't look for anything specific out of any meetings or contacts. Those are ongoing just as they always have been, but wouldn't have any specifics to offer other than normal conversations that go on as we continue to really look at what we have down there and put together our plans and move forward.", "Operator", "And now we'll hear from Arjun Murti with Goldman Sachs.", "Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "David, a couple of questions regarding North America gas potential. ExxonMobil has a successful and large global petrochemicals business, global LNG business. The petrochemicals is focused on Asia and some in the Middle East growth. Can you comment on whether you see your now large domestic gas position as creating opportunities on both the export of LNG from the U.S. or potentially the western Canada and/or coming back to the U.S. in terms of some of the petrochemical expansions which you guys have otherwise focused on in the rest of the world? Do you see that as more of an opportunity going forward for you? And/or how do you plan to take advantage of that?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Arjun, that's a good question. And of course, behind that, it all starts with some of the obvious competitive advantages that we have across the entire space that you covered: our large prolific gas acreage that we have in the U.S., the advantages we have certainly and have already demonstrated and you're seeing in our U.S.-based Chemical business and of course, our global position in LNG. So given that competitive advantage background, I think -- don't think it'll come as any surprise to you that we're studying and assessing the very opportunities that you referred to. I don't have any specifics to offer you, again, other than to say we do have some advantages from all the way through the integration of resources in the products. And as we're always doing, we're thinking about how to optimally develop those, take advantage of the acreage position we have, the resource potential we have, the technology, the marketing advantages, et cetera, to, again, on an integrated basis, exploit those resources. So any ideas you have and are thinking about and the things you read others are doing, you can rest assured we got folks looking at that and studying that as well.", "Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And maybe just a related question, can you talk about any update on your activities in the Marcellus and Utica, as well as the Bakken in terms of maybe how the rig counts are trending and what you're expected to do here over the rest of this year?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure, I'd be happy to. Let me start with the Bakken and back up a little bit because that is an area where we have been, over the last many months, increasing rigs, and we have continued to increase our rigs. We're now -- we've now got 8 operated rigs running in the Bakken. And that is progressing very well, and we are encouraged by that. In the Marcellus, we've got 5 rigs operating. And as you -- well, actually, we got 4 rigs operating. And as you know, we've got just under 700,000 acres in the Marcellus and another 87,000 in the Utica, and so we continue to progress there. But I can tell you, overall, when you're looking at our rig count and what we're doing, I think it's important to kind of step back and think about what we're doing overall. You might recall across most of last year or so, we tended to have, I recall, 70, 72 rigs running in total. We've got about 64 on average in the first quarter. We're running 61 rigs today, and we have continued to shift those to the liquids-rich plays that I mentioned, really focusing on the Bakken, Permian, the Ardmore that I mentioned there. We're looking at and getting ready to plan some wells, get some wells down in the Utica, so all of that's going well and, again, continuing to acquire liquids-rich acreage at attractive prices and shift our rig fleet over to those areas while minimizing the incremental exposure to dry gas wells.", "Operator", "And now we'll hear from Iain Reid with Jefferies.", "Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Can I come back on the production in Africa? You talked about the underlift. But if you add that back, you're still going to face substantial fall from the first quarter of last year in your African production, and I think you said PSC effects. You've been through some threshold effects. Is that right to say that, that, the kind of 50,000, 60,000 barrel a day decline x the underlifts is due to threshold effects, profit all or cost all?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, let me come at it a different way, and remember, the production that we list is the production, and the underlift is really just the sale. So if you come back to the -- just the Africa production decline that you saw in the supplement between the first quarter of last year and the first quarter this year, the bulk of that is accounted for by the entitlement effects that I mentioned, mostly the pricing spend but a little on the net interest side. Everything else kind of washed out.", "Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So this is production, not liftings?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, what we show you -- let me clarify that. What we show you in the supplement, that's a production number. And again, we had some project ramp-up that I mentioned, and we also had some better downtime performance, I'm pleased to say. And then that was basically offset mostly by declines, so the impact you're seeing there really is the impact of higher prices on our entitlement volumes.", "Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Are we talking about Angola mainly here and some -- is it possible to say which fields, Blocks 15 or 17?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Well, I mean , a lot of it's Angola, but it's also Nigeria and some other places and then, of course, our large producing operations there, our Blocks 15 and 17.", "Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And just thinking more generally about second quarter production. You've got some maintenance, I believe, in Angola coming up. Maybe a little bit of field ramp-up, but it was kind of past flow [ph]. Are we looking generally around the same sort of level of production in the second quarter as we saw in the first quarter?", "David S. Rosenthal", "I really don't have any guidance to give you on second quarter production, no real specific events. We do see the projects continuing to ramp up a bit, but I really don't have a real forward outlook for you.", "Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, David, could I just ask one more? You mentioned a couple of times asset sales affecting earnings, and yet there's nothing in the special items here. Is it possible you could tell us what the absolute asset sales was in the first quarter relative to the first quarter of last year in terms of the impact on earnings?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure,  if you look at across the total corporation, as we mentioned in the press release, the absolute earnings associated with asset sales in the first quarter of '12 was about $400 million, and that was generally all in the Downstream. If you look compared to the first quarter of 2011, the number was about the same, about $500 million. But there, the bulk of that was in the Upstream, so you had kind of a switch there. The key variance that you see in our sequential earnings, as we go from the fourth quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year, the total earnings from asset sales in the fourth quarter last year were about $1.4 billion, about $1.1 billion of that in the Upstream and about $300 million of that in the Downstream. So the big sequential impact you see is in the Upstream, and that's really the absence of that significant divestment that we had last quarter. I'd also mention -- yes, let me just mention, just to be clear, in the Downstream, the asset sales that we had in the first quarter related to the previously announced divestments in Malaysia and Central America. We have not booked anything in Japan. As we mentioned last quarter, that'll be later in the year.", "Operator", "And now we'll open the floor up to Paul Cheng with Barclays.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "If I could, I was looking at your cash flow statement. On the working capital and other is a positive swing of $6 billion. That seems to be a big number even for the size of Exxon. Is that related to the timing of taxes payment or anything like that? Or would that -- maybe my question is that, should we assume that, that is here to stay or that at some point in the later year, it's going to get reversed?  The...", "David S. Rosenthal", "Let me answer that one first, Paul, and then I'll let you go to the second question. That's actually very straightforward. During the first quarter, that we saw a big decrease in working capital, and that was literally all due to higher payables. We have some other ins and outs, but the real net effect you're seeing there is a fairly decent increase in our payables counts.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "You said related to crude purchase?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, that's related primarily to crude purchases, and of course, that's price-driven, as you saw the prices ramp up across the quarter such that when you got to the end of the quarter, you had some pretty high prices. But, again, nothing really out of the ordinary, if you look at the quarter and you look at what prices did. But I'm glad you asked the question because that is the impact you're seeing there.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Great. In Woodford Ardmore, what is your current production? I know you normally that don't want to go down there to too much granularity in terms of what is the well production run rate, that kind of thing. But can you also tell us then what is the split between, say, the black oil, condensate, NGL and natural gas in that play and if there's any rough estimate on your 30-day IP that you've been seeing on those?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, Paul, I'll be consistent with your expectations and just say no. I'm not prepared to give that level of detail today. I think what's important is not necessarily the actual production that we're generating there. What's real important is the effort we have underway now to delineate that acreage, to analyze what we have and really put together that comprehensive, long-term exploitation and development plan that we have, and that's what we'll deliver: the volumes and the rates and the earnings down the road. But as we sit here today, I think what's important, we're adding acreage. It's very attractive acreage. If you had a jigsaw puzzle of that area, you'd see that the things we're adding are plugging right in to adjacent properties that we already have. So the acreage position I mentioned isn't just an acreage position.  It's a mostly contiguous acreage position, which, as you would guess, gives us really good opportunities to optimize around the development. So we are seeing nice increases in production as the wells are coming onstream, and we're encouraged by those results. But our focus is less on what today's production is. We're getting the rigs down there. I think I mentioned we added 2 more rigs this quarter to the Ardmore, so we've now got 10 running, and we're working on that area. And as the actual production goes into sales later on, we'll be in a better position to give more information.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, and if I sneak in a quick question?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Poland, how many additional well do you plan to drill this year?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, if you take a look at our Polish position, I think I mentioned last quarter, the wells that we had drilled and how those turned out, I'll tell you that during the first quarter of this year, we did acquire a fourth 3-D seismic activity. The processing of that seismic is ongoing, and the analysis we get out of that compared with the learnings we got from the wells that we drilled will really give us kind of an all-inclusive set of results that we can evaluate and then plan our go-forward plan. But I got to tell you, the go-forward plan is really dependent on the 3-D seismic and again, the real geoscience evaluations that we'll do are really going to drive our future plans, and those just aren't set just yet.", "Operator", "And now we'll move on to Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "I wanted to go back, if I could, on 2 issues that you covered previously: one being the dividend; and the second, Russia. On the dividend, if I look historically, it's around this time of year that you -- the board basically sets a policy for the year. Is it fair to think that the dividend will remain at this level for the balance of the year? Or do you think that we have an opportunity to re-evaluate and potentially increase further in a later quarter?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, Blake, that's a good question, but I really don't have a comment or wouldn't want to try to speculate or forecast what we might do going forward. I think, again, we did raise the dividend yesterday by 21%. Policy is unchanged, if look from a macro perspective. But I really wouldn't want to try to speculate or forecast anything on a go-forward basis.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Fair enough. The question on Russia, I'm just curious if you could talk a little bit about how you arrived at the North American assets to contribute to the JV. When you look at Exxon's portfolio in the U.S., obviously, you've got quite a few options. I'm just curious on the Cardium and Delaware, I mean, was it just similar geologic characteristics? Or was it more financially motivated? Any color you could give would be appreciated.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure, I'd be happy to provide a little more color on that. If you look at the assets that we're talking about in terms of what our partners would get here in the U.S., it's actually a variety of a number of high-quality assets. I mentioned the Cardium, a very attractive tight oil play for us where we've got wells going down and we're drilling. We talked about West Texas and some of the unconventional oil plays we have going on there. And of course, the ability for Rosneft to improve their understanding of the technology that's at work out there and some of the practices we have and that we're doing to optimize the development of that is important to them. And as I talked about, as we learn about the unconventional resources together, what we have in Canada, what we have in the U.S., what they have in western Siberia, there'll be a lot of learning out of that. I also mentioned the Gulf of Mexico where they're going to have an opportunity to farm into 20 blocks. And as you know, we have been expanding our own activity in the Gulf of Mexico, have had some very nice success recently. So it would certainly not be a surprise that those would be attractive acreage opportunities for them. So again, I think you have to step back and look at this partnership just the way we described it. It's a strategic agreement for both parties. It allows us to bring to the table, each of us, very high-quality prospective resources, all of which rely on state-of-the-art and forward-looking technology applications and bring together the best of both companies and also in the interest of both companies going forward. So that's -- and we're talking about other opportunities elsewhere around the world. And so again, I keep coming back to the term Strategic Cooperation Agreement because that's really what it's all about, and you'll see that as we move forward.", "Operator", "And now we'll hear from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "So strong cash flow, good returns. But I guess there's still some criticism of Exxon's sort of overall liquids position in North America, and your shifting -- lowering rig count and shifting to some of the liquids plays you have. But can you give some color on the sort of ability for Exxon to really move the needle in terms of acquiring acreage outside of the Woodford Ardmore, the Cardium and Viking that you're talking to?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, I think it would be fair to say, Ed, it's really kind of both. I mean, we're obviously taking advantage of opportunities, again, to concentrate acreage where we already have a position, and those efforts are bearing fruit. And of course, as you get bigger and more concentrated positions, you've got a real opportunity to better the -- again, the analysis and exploitation of those resources. Moving the needle, there are certainly opportunities, we believe, for that, however you define moving the needle. But those are really going to come, again, with a very deliberate, disciplined, analytical approach to how we go about doing this. I think as I mentioned last quarter, we're very fortunate to have the financial strength the company does and the flexibility to be able to go after these things in a disciplined, diligent way without worrying about paying the bills at the end of the month, and we continue to progress in that arena. We are looking at a broad range of other opportunities that are out there. I can't give you the specifics yet because we're still in the evaluation phase, but there are a number of those out there in North America and, frankly, in other areas. But I'd be remiss if I didn't also remind you of the success -- recent success, we've had with liquid in the Gulf of Mexico, with the big discovery we had there last year. So when you look across North American liquids opportunities, it's not just the unconventional oil potential, but it's also the potential that we have in our attractive acreage position in the Gulf of Mexico. And then broader speaking, I think's important, and you raise a good point, when you see the decline in our liquids production recently. I'll just reiterate one of the comments we made at the analyst meeting in March. If you look at the projects that are going to start up between now and 2016, I think the number we quoted was about 80% of that production will be liquids. So whether it's the Kearl project, whether it's the Africa projects, some of the other things we got going on, we have a strong portfolio of liquids projects in development, and also, the pipeline of opportunities on the exploration side is quite robust. So I think if you continue to look a little longer term, I think we're going to be in really good shape, and we're looking forward, as I mentioned in my remarks, to getting the projects up that we have on the plate for this year and then, in particular, when you get in that 2014 to 2016 time frame, bringing some of those big projects along as well.", "Operator", "And Citigroup's Faisel Khan has our next questions.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "If I can go back to Iraq. In your prepared remark or press release, you talked about a ramp-up in volumes in Iraq and kind of getting to your contracted volumes. Can you discuss a little bit about the infrastructure you're placing on the ground to get up to those contracted volumes that you guys have?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Faisel, help me out a little bit. In particular, infrastructure, what do have you have in mind?", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Pipelines and water injection facilities, stuff like that, processing facilities, I guess, the basic midstream and infrastructure designed to deliver that oil to market.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure. It's a couple of things. If you're looking in the field, in particular, of course, it's important for us to get the flow lines in and do some of the debottlenecking that we can do and thus get some production up that way. If you're looking broader at the infrastructure in terms of the common seawater project, some of the lifting capabilities, in particular, there was a major ramp-up in the capability to take oil out of the country last quarter. So there's a number of projects going on.  Again, some are kind of local and help get the production up. Some are broader. Those are progressing as well. I really don't have any specific comments in terms of timing of some of the other larger infrastructure projects, but those are progressing as well.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. Then last question for me, on non-U.S. Downstream, in the quarter, if I strip out kind of the gains on asset sales and also Imperial Oil reported a pretty nice number in refining as well, if I kind of take that out, it looks like outside of Canada and the asset sales that non-U.S. Downstream reported fairly low earnings. Can you talk about what's dragging those results this quarter?", "David S. Rosenthal", "If you're looking at the Downstream earnings you're really talking about quarter-over-quarter. Is that kind of your emphasis, first quarter '12 versus first quarter '11?", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Yes, that's right.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, we had a number of things. I think the one I'd probably note, if you look at the margin impact that we showed slightly negative relative to some higher industry refining margins that you see quoted, we had a number of price timing effects on our feed slates into the refineries that had a negative impact there and probably would've given you a little impact there that you weren't expecting. Nothing out of the ordinary. It was positive in the first quarter of last year. We had the absence of that in the second quarter. So quarter-on-quarter, you kind of saw that. But I'll tell you, x those effects, things came in just about as we expected.", "Operator", "And now we'll go to Allen Good with MorningStar.", "Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "I wonder -- if I caught you correctly, you said 87,000 acres in the Utica. That seems to be up from the 75,000 you reported at the analyst day. I was just curious if you could confirm that. And then, you talked about the acreage adds in the Ardmore. Are there any other liquids-rich plays that are -- currently interest Exxon and you've been adding acreage in during the quarter?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, let me just confirm, first of all, that the number I gave you of 87,000 is correct, and that is up from the 75,000 that we mentioned at year end. We have been incrementally adding some attractive acreage there as we went across the quarter.", "Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, as far as the discovery in Tanzania, I just wonder, does that change Exxon's outlook there in East Africa? And would there be any potential there for additional acreage adds or maybe farm-ins with some already operators there in the region? Because it seems like it's -- it seems sort of a light portion of your portfolio currently, and obviously, the Tanzania discovery is a positive there. Just wonder sort of what's the outlook for Exxon in that region.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure. Let me first kind of hit the overall that you mentioned. There have been a number of discoveries announced by industry in that area over the last several months. We are very pleased to have the position we have in the block that we farmed into, and it's a very nice discovery. I think I mentioned 5 TCF of recoverable gas, so that's a very positive for us. We are very interested in appraising that prospect further and have some plans in place to do that. In terms of going forward and looking at other things, I wouldn't be any more specific other than to say we're always looking for opportunities, for good opportunities. We were looking when we found this one and pleased to have it. So without being specific or really any departure from past practice, we're always looking for good opportunities. This is one. We're pleased to have it. Probably get our next well underway here in the second quarter to further appraise that prospect. And I'll tell you, in terms of additional opportunities, there are a series of additional structures on the block we have to take a look at and do some more work and appraise. So more to come from on that block with our partner, Statoil. And again, we're both very encouraged with this.  Lots to do on that block, but always looking for additional opportunities.", "Operator", "Argus Research Philip Weiss has our next questions.", "Philip Weiss - Argus Research Company", "Most of my questions have been answered. I just had one small one. On your profitability per barrel, was down relative to the movement in realizations, and I just wondered if that was a function of the underlift or if there's something else going on there.", "David S. Rosenthal", "It's a number of the things I mentioned. Certainly, the underlift would be a big component because you have the reported production that you're dividing the earnings by, and that's why I really wanted to give you the detail on the underlift. It's a big impact. Also, the tax rate impact I mentioned because of some of the mix that we saw, of course, had an impact on calculated unit profitability. Other than that, in the quarter, we did see a little higher OpEx, including some exploration expense higher, that you would've seen in the supplement that we gave you. But again, it's really the U.S. gas price on the North American side and then the mix that we saw overseas and some of the other factors that were the real driver there.", "Operator", "And Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James has our last questions.", "Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Can you give an update on the status at PNG LNG? There's been some press reports about local conflict with residents, and construction, I believe, was suspended for a period of time.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure. Let me give you a progress update on how we're doing in the first quarter. We've done some additional drilling, a number of other efforts associated with the project, everything from the civil works to the work we're doing on the gas conditioning plant and just a number of progress items related to the pipelines, the plant and all of that. So that project is really progressing on schedule, and we're very pleased with how things are going there. You have seen in the press some of the issues around unrest. It's one of the challenges we have with the project. Each large project we seem to do around the world has its own unique set of challenges, so there's nothing out of the ordinary here. We are managing that situation in conjunction with the local communities and with the government. And as you would guess, there has, here and there, been some impact at the individual work sites where some of this activity has occurred. But I can tell you, if you step back and look across the whole project, and it is a complex project, we are on schedule. We're progressing as planned, and there's no change to our outlook for a 2014 startup of that very attractive project.", "Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Can you just say if construction is currently ongoing at the LNG site?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes. Construction is ongoing, yes. We're continuing to progress all phases of the project. ", "Thank you. I want to thank everybody for your time today and the excellent set of questions. So again, thank you and look forward to visiting with you again next quarter.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today.

As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Good morning, and welcome to Exxon Mobil\u2019s second quarter earnings call and webcast. The focus of this call is Exxon Mobil's financial and operating results for the second quarter of 2012. I will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website.", "Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our customary cautionary statement shown on Slide 2.", "Moving to Slide 3. We provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global economic growth slowed in the second quarter, primarily due to continued weakness in European Union. The U.S. and Japanese economies are also expected to show declines from first quarter levels. China growth, while still robust, continues to weaken than prior year levels.", "Energy markets were mixed in the second quarter, with lower crude oil and natural gas prices while industry refining margins increased from the first quarter. Although U.S. chemical margins remained strong, Europe and Asia commodity margins continued at near bottom-of-cycle conditions.", "Turning now to the second quarter financial results as shown on Slide 4. Exxon Mobil's second quarter 2012 earnings were $15.9 billion, an increase of $5.2 billion from the second quarter of 2011. Second quarter earnings included a net impact of $7.5 billion associated with divestments and one-time tax related item.", "Earnings per share for the quarter were $3.41, up a $1.23 from a year ago. The corporation distributed $7.7 billion to shareholders in the second quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding, of that total $5 billion was distributed to purchase shares.", "Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $5 billion in the third quarter of 2012. CapEx in the second quarter was $9.3 billion, down 9% from the second quarter of 2011 primarily due to the absence of acquisitions made in the second quarter of last year.", "Our cash generation remained strong with $13.9 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales. At the end of the second quarter 2012, cash totaled $18 billion and debt was $15.6 billion. The next slide provides additional detail on second quarter sources and uses of fund.", "Over the quarter, cash decreased from $19.1 billion to $18 billion. The combined impact of strong earnings, depreciation expense, working capital and the benefit of our ongoing asset management program, yielded $13.9 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. The $9.6 billion in working capital and other primarily reflects eliminations or gains on asset sales, increased working capital and tax items.", "Uses included additions to plant, property and equipment or PP&E of $8.3 billion and shareholder distributions of $7.7 billion. Additional financing and investing activities increased our cash by $1 billion.", "Moving on to slide six and the review of our segmented results. Exxon Mobil\u2019s second quarter 2012 earnings of $15.9 billion, increased $5.2 billion or 49% from the second quarter of 2011, primarily due to gains from asset sales partly offset by one-time tax item. Upstream earnings decreased to $183 million, while downstream earnings improved by $5.3 billion.", "Chemical earnings were up $128 million, and corporate and financing expenses were flat. Corporate and financing expenses remain within our continued guidance of $500 million to $700 million for quarter. As shown on slide seven, Exxon Mobil\u2019s second quarter 2012 earnings increased by $6.5 billion compared with the first quarter of 2012.", "Moving next to second quarter business highlights and beginning on slide eight. We continue to advance our global portfolio of high quality upstream projects. In Angola, the Kizomba Satellites Phase 1 project achieved first oil in May ahead of schedule. The initial phase has a peak production capacity of 100,000 gross barrels of oil per day, and will cover a total of approximately 250 million barrels from the Mavacola and Clochas fields. The development is located 95 miles of the coast of Angola and water depths of approximately 4,500 feet.", "Phase 1 of the project includes 18 wells with subsea tiebacks to the existing Kizomba A&B floating production, storage and offloading vessels, thus optimizing the capabilities of on block facilities to increase current production levels without requiring an additional FPSO vessel.", "In Nigeria, we completed the installation of three well head platforms as part of the Nigeria Satellite project. These are the first offshore platform structures to be fully constructed in Nigeria. The project is on schedule to start-up in late 2012 with peak capacity of 70,000 gross barrels per day.", "We also completed the installation of the Arkutun-Dagi gravity-based structure, offshore Saklan Island in Russia. We are currently progressing pipeline tie in with topside installation scheduled for 2013. The project will have a peak production capacity of 90,000 gross barrels per day and is on schedule to start up in 2014.", "Construction is also progressing at the Papua New Guinea LNG project which remains on schedule for 2014 start up. The entire 250 mile offshore pipeline has been installed, and over 105 miles or approximately 60% of the onshore portion of the main gas pipeline have been welded.", "At the LNG plant, pipe wrecks and heavy equipment are being installed on the process strength and piling on the jetty is complete. Additionally, mobilization and commissioning of the first two new drill rigs was ongoing during the quarter. The second rig is being mobilized to hide, with drilling expected to begin later this year.", "Also during the quarter, two rigs began drilling in Hadrian North in the Gulf of Mexico to further appraise the resource. The results from these wells will be incorporated into the overall development plan.", "And finally, the Kearl Initial Development project is now 94% complete. All modules have been transported from the United States and integration of the modules into the plant facilities is progressing. The project is on schedule to start up later this year.", "And turning now to Slide 9, we continue to make progress on our strategic cooperation agreement with Rosneft. In June, we signed agreements with Rosneft to jointly develop tight oil reserves in Western Siberia and establish an Arctic Research Center for offshore development. This agreement combines the strengths of our two companies, Exxon Mobil\u2019s technology leadership in tight oil and unconventional resource development and Rosneft\u2019s direct knowledge and experience of Western Siberia\u2019s geology and conventional production.", "In the near future, we will develop a work program for selected Rosneft license blocks which will include geological studies and drilling with drilling planned as early as next year. A pilot program will be established to determine the technical feasibility of developing these reserves.", "The Arctic Research Center will provide a full range of services to support all stages of our joint venture oil and gas development on the Arctic shelf, including ice monitoring and management, logistics, and the design of ice resistant offshore vessels, structures and Arctic pipelines. Safety standards will be a priority for the center, which will have its own special marine incident warning and prevention center.", "In addition, we progress joint exploration activities in the Black Sea where seismic acquisition is now complete. We remain on schedule to commence seismic acquisition in the Kara Sea later this year. Exploration drilling is expected to being in 2014-2015 timeframe, as soon as prospect mapping is complete and a rig is contracted.", "Turning now to conventional exploration on slide 10; in the quarter, we achieved continued success in our conventional exploration portfolio. In Tanzania, we drilled a second exploration well with our partner Statoil. As indicated by the operator, this well has confirmed the discovery of approximately 2 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas. This follows our first exploration well on the block, which discovered approximately 5 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas.", "We also made a gas discovery on acreage in North Western Papua New Guinea, and have commenced drilling of a second well in the Highlands. This exploration activity is designed to support expansion studies for a third train at our Papua New Guinea LNG project.", "Also during the quarter, we drilled our third well in Vietnam which encountered additional gas. Results from this well are being evaluated. In light of the encouraging results in Romania, planning for further exploration activity is underway. We expect to begin acquisition of a new 3D survey on the Neptune license by year end. And finally, we were high bidder on 22 blocks in the recent Central U.S. Gulf of Mexico lease sale.", "Moving on to slide 11, we continue to advance our growing portfolio of high potential unconventional assets in liquid rich plays like the Bakken, the Woodford Ardmore and the Neuquen Basin in Argentina. In the Bakken, we have moved into a development phase across our roughly 400,000 net acre leasehold. In the first half of 2012, we turned 40 wells to sales, nearly double the pace of 2011. In the second quarter of 2012, our gross operated Bakken production increased by 60% over the prior year quarter. Since our entry into the play, we have more than doubled gross operative production to approximately 32,000 oil equivalent barrels per day.", "In the Woodford Shale and the Ardmore Basin, we completed a strategic bolt-on acquisition adding 58,000 acres of leasehold and just over 4,000 oil equivalent barrels per day of production. This brings our total Woodford Ardmore acreage to approximately 260,000 net acres and expands our resource potential beyond the 600 million oil equivalent barrels previously estimated. In the second quarter, we utilized 10 rigs to delineate our acreage, to evaluate optimal well spacing and continue development activity.", "Moving to South America, we have drilled two exploration wells in our Argentina's Neuquen Basin. Testing at the first well is underway. The second well is scheduled to be completed and tested in the third quarter. A third exploration well is also planned to spud during the third quarter. Our efforts are currently concentrated on defining the resource potential of our more than 800,000 net acre leasehold.", "Turning out to slide 12, on the North American chemical growth project, during the quarter, Exxon Mobil Chemical filed permit applications to progress plans for a world scale, petrochemical expansion that our integrated Baytown, Texas complex. The project includes a new ethane cracker with up to 1.5 million tons per annum on ethylene capacity, which will see two new 650,000 tons per year premium polyethylene lines situated at the nearby Mont Belvieu plastics plant. The proposed expansion capitalizes on the abundant and growing supply of North America natural gas liquids to economically supply the rapidly growing global demand for high performance polyethylene products. These metallocene based premium resins deliver sustainability benefits such as lighter packaging weight, lower energy consumption, and reduced emissions. Required government reviews and approvals are expected to take about a year after which Exxon Mobil will make a final investment decision. If progressed, a 2016 start-up would be anticipated.", "Turning now to the Saudi Elastomers project on slide 13, during the quarter, the KEMYA 50-50 joint venture partners Saudi Basic Industries Corporation and Exxon Mobil announced the decision to proceed with construction of the specialty elastomers project at Al-Jubail, Saudi Arabia. This continues a long history of Exxon Mobil investment in the Kingdom and represents a significant broadening of KEMYA\u2019s product portfolio.", "The facility will have the capacity to produce up to 400,000 tons per year of specialty products including synthetic rubber, thermoplastic specialty polymers and carbon black to serve local markets, the Middle East and Asia. Project completion is expected in 2015.", "Turning now to the upstream financial and operating results and starting on slide 14, upstream earnings in the second quarter were $8.4 billion, down $183 million from the second quarter of 2011. Realization has decreased earnings by $870 million due primarily to lower crude oil and U.S. natural gas realizations, which declined by more than $8 per barrel and $2 per thousand cubic feet respectively.", "Production mix and volume effects negatively impacted earnings by $330 million, due mainly to the impact of lower entitlement volumes, base decline and divestments, partly offset by the ramp-up of Nigeria and Angola projects. All other items are nearly gains from asset divestments and lower exploration expense, partly offset by one-time tax items and higher production operating expenses increased earnings by $1 billion. Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel for the second quarter of 2012 were $22.12.", "Moving to Slide 15, oil equivalent volumes decreased by 5.6% from the second quarter of last year, mainly due to the impact of lower entitlement volumes, decline and divestments. Volumes were positively impacted by the ramp up of projects in Nigeria and Angola and less downtime. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production was essentially flat.", "Turning now to the sequential comparison and starting it on Slide 16. Upstream earnings increased by $556 million versus the first quarter of 2012. Lower crude oil and natural gas realizations negatively impacted earnings by more than $700 million, as crude oil realizations decreased by more than $10 per barrel and average gas realizations decreased by $0.60 per thousand cubic feet.", "Production mix and volume effects decreased earnings by $480 million due to a decline and seasonal gas demand in Europe, base decline and lower entitlement volumes, partly offset by the ramp up of projects in Nigeria and Angola. Other items, including gains from asset divestments, lower exploration expense and favorable Forex, partly offset by one-time tax items, increased earnings by $1.8 billion.", "Moving now to Slide 17, oil equivalent volumes were down 8.8% from the first quarter of 2012 resulting from a decrease in seasonal gas demand in Europe, base declined on lower entitlement volumes, partly offset by the ramp up of projects in Nigeria and Angola. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production was down 7.6%.", "Year-to-date, oil equivalent volumes decreased 5.5% compared to the first six months of 2011. First half 2012 volumes associated with the 3% full-year decline outlook, provided at the Analyst Meeting in March are shown on Slide 18. Operational performance was slightly ahead of plan, benefitting from the early startup of the Nigeria Usan and Angola Satellites projects and strong base performance.", "First half 2012 prices most notably in February through April were higher than our March Analyst Meeting outlook basis of $111, and negatively affected first half volumes due to both permanent and price related entitlements. In the second half of 2012, successful startup of several projects and continued strong base performance will support our 2012 volumes.", "Moving now to the downstream, financial, and operating results and starting on slide 19.", "Downstream earnings in the second quarter were $6.6 billion, up $5.3 billion from the second quarter of 2011. The driver for the increase was a $5.3 billion gain associated with the Japan restructuring, which was completed on June 1. This gain was partly offset by unfavorable Forex effects, one-time tax items, and increased maintenance activities. Improved refining margins, mainly in the U.S. and Europe increased earnings by $650 million.", "Moving to slide 20. sequentially, second quarter downstream earnings increased by $5.1 billion, primarily due to the Japan restructuring and improved refining margins partly offset by Forex effects, increased refinery maintenance and one-time tax items and the absence of first quarter gain on asset sales.", "Turning now to the chemical, financial, and operating results starting on slide 21. second quarter chemical earnings were $1.4 billion, up $130 million versus the second quarter of 2011. Margins decreased earnings by 150 million, as lower commodity margins were only partly offset by improved specialty margins. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $100 million mainly reflecting weaker demand in Europe.", "Other factors increased earnings by $380 million, which includes $630 million associated with the Japan restructuring, partly offset by unfavorable Forex effects.", "Moving to slide 22. sequentially, second quarter chemical earnings increased by $750 million mainly associated with the Japan restructuring.", "Stronger margins increased earnings by $160 million, primarily due to lower feedstock costs. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $70 million mainly due to weaker demand in Europe.", "And finally moving to Slide 23. Exxon Mobil's second quarter financial and operating performance reflects the ability of our business model and competitive advantages to deliver strong results.", "As we continue to focus on operational excellence, deploy high-impact technologies and leverage our unparalleled global integration, Exxon Mobil remains well positioned to maximize long-term shareholder value.", "That concludes my prepared remarks. I would now be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Rosenthal. (Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Doug Terreson with ISI.", "Douglas T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group, Inc.", "Good morning, David.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Good morning, Doug. How are you?", "Douglas T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group, Inc.", "I\u2019m doing fine. My question is on foreign exchange, FX, asset sales, and tax items and specifically whether or not you have functional and geographical quantification on those items in Q2, I mean there was a pretty large lump in the quarter, and I just wanted to see if we could get little color and segmentation?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yeah, let me \u2013 why don\u2019t I start with the items in the $7.5 million.", "Douglas T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group, Inc.", "Okay.", "David Rosenthal", "$7.5 billion, I\u2019m sorry. The primary item in there was $6.5 billion associated with the Japan restructuring.", "Douglas T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group, Inc.", "Right.", "David Rosenthal", "Okay. And the segmentation of that $6.5 billion was $5.3 billion in Japan, I mean in the Downstream, $600 million in Chemical, $400 million in corp and fin, and about $100 million in the Upstream. And the balance of the $7.5 billion really related to gains on asset sales in the Upstream primarily Angola Block 31 and a number of tax related items.", "Douglas T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group, Inc.", "Okay. And also in A&P business there was commentary that several of the major integrated gas projects in Australia faced cost overruns that is the most budget contingencies were appropriate at the time. So I wanted to get your insight in the trends and investment performance versus budget in Australia, because Exxon has been in the country for many years and given that you have significant holdings besides the integrated gas you obviously hold a unique perspective. So any trends that you could highlight or provide insight into would be appreciated.", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah, I'll make a general comment, and then for specific project updates I\u2019d recommended that you [to talk] with the operator of any specific project. But in general over the last couple of years, we have seen some foreign exchange issues with the Australian dollar as well as across the board there have been some cost pressures on labor; and I think those have been well documented in the industry. That's all part of normal project management for us, and you have to find ways to offset those, I think the important things on some of these large projects in addition to cost management is to ensure that the project stays on schedule and comes up on time, and that generally is the focus. But again, if you had a specific project in mind, I\u2019d recommend you ask the operator for any specific update.", "Douglas T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group, Inc.", "Sure, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.", "Ed G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities", "", "Hey, good morning David.", "David S. Rosenthal", "", "Good morning, Ed.", "Ed G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities", "Just two quick questions, first the buyback. I mean obviously, you\u2019re still maintaining a $5 billion; you did get some good sources and uses of cash from acquisitions. And [dragging] in Europe is making comments which is helping the oil price. But if we do see a slowdown, how do you think about the rate of buybacks being appropriate, and if the earnings starting to support the buybacks, do you see enough disposals in the pipeline to compensate?", "David S. Rosenthal", "", "Ed, I really won\u2019t want to comment or provide any guidance on forward expectations with regard to allocation of funds. Other than to say, there is no change in our ongoing view of that, and as you know our first priority just find all of our attractive investment opportunities, after that is to pay a growing dividend and you recall we did raise the dividend 21% earlier this year. And then after that, it\u2019s the share buyback to maintain our capital structure and return excess cash to shareholder. So no change in our approach and we\u2019ll see as the year goes along to how the cash flows turn out given the conditions in the market, but no change in our approach.", "Ed G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities", "Thanks. And then just a specific one on the operations. Asia gas volumes were being pretty steady for a number of quarters until the second quarter of 2012, was that maintenance or was that a PSC effect in terms of a tranche kicking in somewhere.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yeah, let me provide a little more clarity on that, because your question also gets to the main factor if you look at our volume breaks and you look at the entitlement effects that you saw there. And really the impact you\u2019re seeing in Qatar, and I want you know that that unlike the RasGas and Qatargas, LNG trains, the AKG projects, which as you know supports domestic gas sale, does operate under a development and production sharing agreement.", "And during the quarter that project became cost current and that did impact both the volumes that you see in the region that we noted, as well as the entitlement volumes that we talked about. As far as performance, performance is expected in the region and all the countries there and the assets that we operate. And again the real impact is AKG becoming cost current.", "Ed G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities", "And it\u2019s fair to think about domestic prices being lower than the other project, so that would have a lesser impacts on cash flow than the headline production?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yeah, that would be a correct assumption.", "Ed G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities", "Thanks, very much David.", "David S. Rosenthal", "All right; thank you, Ed.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll now go to Doug Leggate with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. Hi, David.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Hi, Doug. How are you today?", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Not too bad, thank you. I wanted to go back to one of the events during the quarter which was I guess your official exit from Poland. And I just wanted to get your updated prognosis on shale gas in Europe generally and (inaudible) that\u2019s one of the biggest producers obviously in Northwest Europe. What are your implications for you gravitating back to work exports of LNG in the well 48? And I have another follow-up please.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Those are two distinctly different questions. When we look at Poland, we did drill and complete and test two wells, one in each of the two basins that we were in there. And we did not have any demonstrated, sustained commercial hydrocarbon flow from either of those two wells. and so we have decided to end our exploration activities in Poland at this time.", "Now as you look across Europe, there are a number of other opportunities and a number of other countries, the people are looking at including ourselves. And so I wouldn\u2019t draw any conclusions in any one country or across Europe, it\u2019s early days. We have set off and as you look around the world that all the unconventional resource opportunities, they\u2019re all different; they\u2019re all in the early stages of evaluation. And it\u2019s going to take some time to figure that up.", "Now I will mention, because we haven\u2019t talked about it in a little while, our holdings in Germany. and as you know, we have a very large acreage position in Germany and we continue to want to actively explore that. as you know, we've had some permitting issues there over the last year or so that has held that program up.", "I can\u2019t tell you that the expert dialog group that has been studying this issue for a while has reported their findings unlike many other similar studies and findings across the world, including the U.S., this group do not see any fundamental, environmental, or other risk aspects that would argue against the exploration and production of natural gas from unconventional reservoirs.", "So with that study out, we are in the process now of working on getting our \u2013 working with the regulators particularly in the local areas and the community at large to progress our exploration plants and get the permits necessary to progress. So again, I think every country is different, every unconventional resource opportunity is different and it would be tough to make any geographic conclusions at this time.", "Now if we switch over to the potential for LNG exports out of North America, we are continuing to study those options both in the U.S. and in Canada, as you know, we have vast unconventional holdings in both of those locations. We have a lot of optionality, a lot of flexibility; we do have some assets in the ground already to import LNG. So we are continuing to study all that and look at our options and the economics and more on that as time goes on.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, David. I guess I was thinking that, I look probably European gas would impact your gas decision as well I hope that was one question. If I could try a second is a very quick follow-up on, there is some second half of this question, you didn\u2019t give the FX or the tax impacts by division, if you could that would be really helpful? I\u2019ll leave it there, thanks.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure. Let me first give you the foreign exchange impacts, if you are looking at the second quarter of \u201912 versus the second quarter of \u201911, we had about a negative $200 million delta on Forex in the downstream and then another two\u2026", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "I apologize for interrupting, could you give us the absolute as opposed to the deltas is that possible?", "David S. Rosenthal", "I don\u2019t actually have the absolute number, Ed, I have \u2013 Doug, I\u2019m sorry, the deltas again I think if you are just looking at (inaudible) it\u2019s $200 million negative in downstream and 200 in chemical, but I don\u2019t have the absolutes.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "All right, thanks very much.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "I will now go to Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Good morning, David.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Good morning, Evan.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "How are you doing? A question on Kara, I know you mentioned the project start-up in the back half of the year. How should we expect volumes in 3Q and 4Q and what\u2019s the volumetric plant there in the start-up and then somewhat related, I guess, I believe that the 50% goes to Exxon refineries and then 50% into the market? I guess we should assume that (inaudible) refineries first, and is there any feedstock change, being used system as a result of that?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure, sure. Let me hit the status of the project. first, it\u2019s progressing very well, as I mentioned, we\u2019re 94% complete, and I got the modules in place and that we\u2019re in the U.S. and we\u2019re progressing towards a late start-up. That start-up is probably a December start-up. Our intention is to ramp up to 110,000 barrels per day of production from that. but to give you a quarterly number or a specific timing would be real difficult, because again, if you\u2019re not going to start up till December, it won\u2019t have a huge impact.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "And what\u2019s the expected maybe trajectory to either kind of gross, 110 gross?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yeah. We\u2019ll be ramping that up, obviously from the time we\u2019d start up into the next year. I don\u2019t have a specific ramp up profile, other than to say as safely as possible and with the operations running, we\u2019ll ramp up to that 110 as quickly as possible. But I don\u2019t have a specific timeline for you right now.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Great. But from the feedstock?", "David S. Rosenthal", "I'm sorry\u2026", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "On the feedstock\u2026", "David S. Rosenthal", "The first thing I\u2019d say is, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say we have a 50/50 mix of what\u2019s going to our refineries versus what\u2019s going to go into the market, the other part of your comment is correct, we will optimize in general to displace the placement of those barrels, but certainly having the flexibility of our own refineries in Canada as well in the Midwest, we\u2019ll be able to optimize those first, and then put the balance in the barrels. But that will change depending on the market, which is you know has been fairly volatile recently. And so if I gave you a split today that may or may not be the split six months ago, but you\u2019re certainly spot on with your comment about us optimizing first into our refineries, and then the balance going into the market so that we can maximize the value of all the barrels really across the whole refining circuit.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay, and if I may just \u2013 thank you. If I may just one other question.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Thanks for the update of on the PNG LNG project and it sounds like you are really moving along well there. I mean, can you remind us of how much gas excluding, I guess these recent discoveries is behind that development, and whether \u2013 are further discoveries necessary for potential expansion opportunities there?", "David S. Rosenthal", "If you look at, first if you look at the trains, those are to 6.6 trains will start-up in 2014, and as I recall the total resource back in that is up about 9 Tcf.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. So you need additional discoveries likely to expand right?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yeah, and that's what I said, earlier that two things are going on, we are certainly studying the opportunity for a third train, and the positive news is we\u2019re having exploration success this year in drilling some wells and we have an active exploration program ongoing with a lot of additional acreage that we have available to us. So it\u2019s a positive story with the steel we got going in the ground now; it\u2019s a positive story on the exploration front. So we\u2019ll continue to focus on getting what we have up and running while steadying for further expansion and optimization.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Great, thank you. Thanks for taking my question.", "David S. Rosenthal", "", "Thank you for the questions.", "Operator", "We will now go to Paul Cheng with Barclays.", "Paul Y. Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Hi, Dave. Good morning.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Good morning, Paul. How are you?", "Paul Y. Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Very good. Two quick questions. You\u2019ve been quite active in building in Gulf of Mexico and had good success, are you now, all set with all your rig requirements for the next say one or two years or is that you will meet additional requirement there?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Well, if you look at what we\u2019re doing now in the Gulf of Mexico, probably the biggest thing we got going right now, is the two wells that we\u2019re drilling simultaneously at Hager & North as we continue to look at that resource. As we go on through the year, we are looking at the possibility of another well in the Gulf before year-end. But we\u2019re now talking about a specific rig line or what\u2019s contracting, and what\u2019s not, what I could tell you is we do have flexibility around the rig fleet. We are planning for a sustained exploration program. And when we look at the opportunities and the rig availabilities and the assets that we have under contracts, I think we\u2019re well positioned to progress the program, I don\u2019t see any constraints or any holds up in terms of equipment availability.", "Paul Y. Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Dave, if your current rig, the contract expand into let\u2019s say 2013 and 2014 or that is expanding this year?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Paul, I really wouldn\u2019t want to comment specifically on rigs and lease arrangements and that sort of thing, those are all part of commercial nature of the business, and so really wouldn't want to get into any specifics on that.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.", "\t", "Okay, sure. The second question that \u2013 you have to \u2013 I have to apologize, yeah, probably due to my ignorance. Given the low natural gas price over the last 12 months in the U.S., if the natural gas price stay at say $2 to $3 dollar per Mcf range, is there a circumstance that would force you guys that to look at your open reserve booking from the XTO and also that any way down for separately how is the accounting from that standpoint?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yeah, Paul if we step back just a little bit obviously that is a very large resource that we acquired in the XTO acquisition. Some of it is book to prove reserves, bought a whole lot of it is really in the resource base. And so, when you look at prices and the volatility of those prices, and what's going on, I don't think when you look at our outlook going forward that we see ourselves really getting into the issues that you're talking about without getting into any specifics on accounting, and reserve reporting. I'm confident that if you look at that resource and what we've got book now in the conservative nature, with which we tend to book proved reserves, I\u2019m not expecting there to be any issues in that area.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.", "So, should we assume that the ceiling test you would be allowed to use your own internal long-term price deck?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, if you look at that ceiling test as far as I know, you do use your own long-term expectation for those prices.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Thank you.", "Operator", "I will now go to Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.", "Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil Inc.", "David, good morning. I have a couple of questions for you on two different projects. one is back to the Gulf of Mexico and Julia, I know there are some issues with the government a while back and as I understand, you\u2019ve worked that out and you\u2019ve now retained the block. Can you just give us an update on, if I recall, it seemed to be fairly large discovery, any update on timing and activity out there?", "David S. Rosenthal", "", "Sure. I\u2019ll be happy to give you an update on that. as you know, we did drill that first exploration well in 2007, it was successful. we did have some issues with the Department of Interior around that license. I can confirm that the comment that you made, yes, those issues have been resolved. And in fact, if I look across the second quarter, we are working on the development plans for that. in fact, we are really progressing in the technical validation program at this time and front-end engineering and development. and late in the quarter, we did place some initial long lead equipment items.", "So if you look at the whole broader schedule, we are progressing as rapidly as appropriate. but again, we\u2019re already in the process of ordering long lead programs, working on the development plan and the evacuation plan. So that project is progressing.", "Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil Inc.", "Okay, great, thank you. And then the other one was actually on the Tanzania, it sounds like you\u2019ve got about 7 TCF discovered to-date. I\u2019m wondering for one, how much need in order to justify development? and secondly, my understanding is that government will not approve multiple development. So it\u2019s almost a bit of a race to see who is going to have the first move or advantage, I\u2019m just curious if there\u2019s any update on your activity there?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yeah. Let me hit the first question on the results in Tanzania, that has been today a very successful exploration effort for us. We have said that the first well looks like we got about 5 Tcf of developable reserves there, and then the second well looks like we got about 2; so, for a total of 7 Tcf. I can tell you we are continuing with our exploration activities, we got some additional seismic going on this year, and may even put another well before the end of year. So that's all going very well.", "I would want to give a specific number in terms of what's required for an LNG project, because it could have multiple aspects to developing that. and so I wouldn\u2019t want to give specific number there. In terms of the race to get a project underway, I\u2019m not aware of any constraints on that program. It is still early days in that whole area of East Africa as you know. There has been a tremendous amount of activity and some successful discoveries, but to start discussing order of projects and who gets there first and that sort of thing, I think it probably will be premature to talk about that.", "Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil", "Okay, fair enough. Thank you, David.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And then I\u2019ll go to Faisel Khan with Citi.", "Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup", "Thank you, David. Good morning.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Good morning, Faisel. How are you?", "Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup", "Good, how are you doing there?", "David S. Rosenthal", "I\u2019m fine.", "Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup", "I am wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on what\u2019s going on with U.S. natural gas production. it looks like it peaked at about 4 Bcf a day in the fourth quarter of last year and it\u2019s been coming down steadily. I was wondering if that\u2019s the function of your shift in rig count in the lower 48.", "David S. Rosenthal", "It's a number of factors. You have to start at the top of that with base decline, across the conventional resources and decline that we\u2019re seeing there. If that\u2019s going to be partly offset by the increases in unconventional gas production. But as you pointed out, we have seen a shift and that shift continues in our rig count, to the liquids-rich plays. So the program itself is, as I described before, we are managing across the entire portfolio, which does include continuing to delineate, appraise, and evaluate the dry gas areas, while at the same time, focusing the drilling on the liquids-rich plays. And the other thing that we\u2019ve had in there, we have had some divestments, you might recall we had one in the Gulf of Mexico a year or so ago and that would decline \u2013 would have an impact there. So, it\u2019s really a combination of decline, divestments, some shifting of rigs and then offset by the production increase that we\u2019ve seen in the unconventional resources at XTO.", "Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay. And I believe at the Analyst Meeting, you guys talked about how you were running maybe just under 70 rigs, I am not sure if it\u2019s still the right number or not. but it seemed like you had shifted to 50% of those rigs were now drilling in liquids-rich plays. Can you give us an update on where you are with that sort of mix in rig count?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yeah, sure. We have continued to both reduce the absolute number of rigs running. I think we averaged about 57 across the quarter. We\u2019re currently in about 51 rigs in total, and without giving a specific percentage, I can tell you the majority of those rigs are working on liquids and liquid-rich plays and that obviously would be a continuation of the trend that you are seeing over the last few quarters.", "Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup", "Thanks David. And last question from me. On Slide 16, where you talked about the first quarter to second quarter sort of progression of earnings for Upstream. The $1.76 billion sort of other, and you said, part of that was Angola and part of that was favorable FX. Was the FX sort of movement, was that a absolute number or was there a big change quarter-to-quarter because of something in the first quarter?", "David S. Rosenthal", "", "No, again it was kind of small, it was less than a $100 million and that would be the change quarter-on-quarter. So within that bar, it's not a big effect either way.", "Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay, great. Thanks for the time, I appreciate it.", "", "David S. Rosenthal", "All right, thank you.", "Operator", "", "And we\u2019ll now go to Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.", "Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James & Associates", "Thanks very much. Two related question about Rosneft, if I can. First one is as you know Rosneft has public said, they are talking to BP about the potential TNK acquisition. If that happens how do you see that changing your relationship with them. And second question on the same point, has Exxon contemplated buying the TNK-BP stake?", "David S. Rosenthal", "", "Actually my answer would be the same to both of those questions. I really couldn't provide any comment on either what others in the industry are doing or anything that we might have gone on and are thinking about.", "Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James & Associates", "", "I appreciate it.", "", "David S. Rosenthal", "All right, thank you.", "", "Operator", "", "I will now go to John Herrlin with Societe Generale.", "John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale", "Yes, hi David. Unconventional liquids was about 5% or 6% of the U.S. oil production or liquids production. How big do you want to make that on a going forward basis? I mean, how large a ramp should we anticipate?", "David S. Rosenthal", "", "That's a question I really couldn't answer because I have no idea what the forward projections are going to look like. Obviously there's a lot of activity, a lot of plays, we are certainly heavily involved both as I mentioned in the ramp-up of our existing fields like we have at the Bakken, but also in the pursuit and capture of a number of attractive acreage holdings like we mentioned in the Woodford Ardmore and the Utica.", "So from an Exxon Mobil perspective, I can tell you as we move out of these delineation appraisal and valuation of programs into full development, you'll continue to see the ramp-up that I mentioned in my prepared remarks, particularly in places like the Bakken and then in some of the other areas. But we don't have a target and I couldn't give you a target for the industry. It's really just going to depend on how quickly these new opportunities that us and others are finding. You can get in and get those online and then of course you need the midstream infrastructure to evacuate those volumes and get them to market and to the extent that you're producing NGLs, there is other midstream infrastructure that has to be put into process.", "So, there's a lot of opportunity, a lot of nice ramp-up kind of across the board as you mentioned. But it would certainly be hard for me to give any indication of what kind of ultimate target might be either for us or the industry in general.", "John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale", "Thanks I was only asking about Exxon. But thanks David.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Okay, all right.", "Operator", "And then I\u2019ll go to Ian Reid with Jefferies.", "Iain Reid \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "Hi, David. Good morning.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Hey Iain. How are you doing?", "Iain Reid \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "I\u2019m doing very well actually. And couple questions, firstly and thinking about your U.S. onshore operations at the moment. Have you got an updated number for either capital employed in U.S. onshore or return on capital employed, which you\u2019re generating at the moment?", "David S. Rosenthal", "No, we don\u2019t typically give that level of detail, Ian. So, I wouldn\u2019t have either of the capital employed number or the return on that.", "Iain Reid \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "Okay, all right. Second question is about dividends. Obviously you\u2019ve made a pretty substantial increase in your dividend payments. I just wonder when you are thinking about that and how do you factor in potential changes in dividend taxes, withholding taxes in the U.S., is that something you think about or is this kind of more fundamental change or increase you\u2019ve made?", "David S. Rosenthal", "A number of factors as you would guess go into the whole decision-making process about the allocation of cash and that sort of thing. Though, I wouldn\u2019t want to comment on any one specific factor or even to speculate ultimately what the tax situation might look like or changes that we might see in the upcoming several months. So, again a number of factors we think about, we don\u2019t try to speculate a whole lot about the future from the standpoint that you mentioned, so I really wouldn\u2019t have a specific comment on that.", "Iain Reid \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "So, was there something investors were kind of pressing you to look at rather than as a kind of add-on to the existing share buyback, was that part of the rational?", "David S. Rosenthal", "We spend a lot of time talking to our investors about a number of things; dividends are one, share buybacks are another. Not all of the investors are interested or have a waiting to any one particular disposition over another, some have one preference and others have another. We do spend some time looking at the competitiveness of both our total distributions and the breakout of those and we do look at that. But in particular on a specific input or a specific factor in the analysis, I wouldn\u2019t give any waiting to one over the other. We do spend time taking all the factors into consideration and of course that includes input we get directly from our shareholders.", "Iain Reid \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "Okay. Last question please on Vietnam; I believe you proved up quite a substantial amount of gas now that with these three wells following on from, last year\u2019s discovery. And any numbers you want to share with us about what sort of level of reserves you proved up, you gave us obviously something on Tanzania and maybe you can also talk about the forward program on that?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure, I can tell you. We are not as far along in assessing what we have in Vietnam as we were in Tanzania. We\u2019re still evaluating the wells there. We had one well that was not successful and two that were, and so we\u2019re still in the early days. So looking at that we got a lot of work to do, lot of evaluation to do and to assess that we are looking at additional seismic and other expiration activity. But little early to start giving you resource numbers at this time.", "Iain Reid \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "All right, David. Thanks for that.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Now we will go to Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Hi, David.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Hi, Paul. How are you doing?", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Fine, thank you. Apologies, I\u2019m traveling today, so I got on the call late. But I did want to ask you about your specials and the way you declare them. I guess the question is, I completely don't understand what \u2013 why you depend those specials, in the table of specials, but then immediately say, there were lot of specialists?", "David S. Rosenthal", "", "Paul, let's talk just a minute about in term of specials, and I think, I can address your question. Really, you have to think about two different considerations when you're talking about special items. The first that I'd offer you is, if look at this from an Exxon Mobil perspective both asset divestments, and acquisitions that become a normal part of our ongoing operations. We talked at the Analyst Meeting in March about the level of divestments that we've had. If I just look across the last four or five years, I think we've had $26 billion in proceeds and about $11 billion in earnings.", "So, this is an ongoing piece of the business for us. Some quarters the numbers are a little larger than others, but in terms of divestments being special they are part of the business. I think the other thing to consider is that the use of the term special items has in fact evolved over time, driven in part by updated SEC guidance on the use of non-GAAP terms. And we are certainly in compliance with that updated guidance and paying attention to it, and it has evolved over the last few years. So, if you take those two factors into consideration, I think, you know what we've reported here this quarter is consistent with both of those.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "So is that SEC definition a question materiality then or and I think the other \u2013 find very odd, David, is that you continue to publish this table of zeros, which just kind of seems inefficient quite frankly, but can you just talk a bit more about what you are saying about the SEC. I understand your argument that the divestments are an ongoing part of your business and therefore shouldn't be considered special. I think that\u2019s [fine] the SEC bit.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure, without getting into the weeds here, I can tell you that is not really a materiality look. It\u2019s really around the desire for the SEC for company to not describe a charge or gain as the non-recurring infrequent or unusual event unless it meets certain criteria, and that includes a look back as well as a look forward. So, if you're looking back and you've been doing this stuff in the past, and you look forward, and you think that you might have these type of events in the future, the SEC guidance as to not call those non-recurring infrequent unusual special or whatever term, you want to use, and again that has happened over time.", "In terms of the table and efficiency, I'll tell you it's possible. I\u2019m not saying that we'll never report a special items, because we may, I\u2019m just saying that when we look at the guidance in our business, none of the earnings impact that you saw in the quarter qualified to be the \u2018special items'.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "If I could just follow-up on Paul Cheng, and is kind of related. I think you were saying that would very, very unlikely be a write down related to XTO, because I guess what you're implying a very conservative in booking what is essentially a very, very large resource.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yeah, I think it's a couple of things, Paul, it's the conservative nature for which we book things to proved reserves, and it's also our outlook for natural gas prices. If you look broadly and look at our energy outlook, we don't have an outlook over the long-term, the prices are going to remain at current levels, and that's consistent with our investment plans, it's consistent with our energy outlook and it's really consistent with the long-term way that we're going about developing these resources.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, David thanks. I think, I understand, I just wondering, is the SEC going back to that allows you to use your own long-term planning assumption for nat gas prices as regard to booking?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yeah, that's correct.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, that\u2019s good. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll now go to Allen Good with Morningstar.", "Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar", "Good morning, David. Just one quick question on the lower 48 activity, it looks like you made pretty good progress in reducing the rig count there and moving towards liquids-rich plays, but if we look back sort of a year ago, you were at 70 rigs and natural gas prices were at $4. and then certainly they\u2019ve made quite a recovery off the lows, we saw earlier this quarter and whether that\u2019s sustainable or not, it\u2019s certainly a question, but is the $4 level to think about that Exxon will maybe potentially return to gas drilling or given the low base of rigs, you are working off now, there certainly have to be different conditions where you would revisit some of these gas plays that you\u2019ve moved away from over the past six months?", "David S. Rosenthal", "I think the answer to the question, and what you\u2019re seeing us doing is really more reflective of our longer-term approach to this. We are still drilling in dry gas areas. We do continue to drill wells in order to work on our delineation, and our evaluation of those plays to make sure that again over the long-term, we want to be in a position to maximize the recovery and maximize the value generation from those resources, so that hasn't changed. What you have seen that we've talked about is both a reduction in the total rig count, and some of that of course is in response to the short-term pricing that\u2019s happened. In addition, the move of \u2013 a lot of the rigs over liquids and liquids-rich is really both to start to delineate and appraise and think about developing our new acreage like the Woodford Ardmore, again as well as wrapping up in the Bakken.", "In fact, I think I heard the other day we're up about 10 rigs in the Bakken, out of those 51. We really don\u2019t have a price trigger to any big extent. You might do something a little different at the margin in any given quarter depending on prices. but when you really look at the overall plan and the overall strategy, it continues to be with a very long-term view of this, very large, very high quality source we got.", "Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar", "Okay. In the short-term though, do you expect that 51 rigs total you\u2019re currently running? Is that enough to do everything you want to do as far as evaluating those plays and driving production on liquid-rich plays or would we expect during short-term to see that rig count continue to fall?", "David S. Rosenthal", "I really don't have an outlook going forward for the rig count. We continue to progress the program, and we could see some variability around the number that I mentioned, but I really couldn\u2019t give you an outlook in terms of either direction or rig count specifically.", "Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar", "Okay, thank you very much.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Bye, thank you very much.", "Operator", "It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Rosenthal, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.", "David S. Rosenthal", "No I\u2019d just like to thank everybody on the call today and thank you for your questions and we look forward to visiting you again next quarter. So thank you very much.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

Please note, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning, and welcome to Exxon Mobil\u2019s third quarter earnings call and webcast. The focus of this call is Exxon Mobil's financial and operating results for the third quarter of 2012. I will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website.", "Before we begin today, I would like to say a few words of support for those who have been impacted by Hurricane Sandy, which I know includes many people listening to today's call. Our thoughts are with you as you work to recover from the effects of the storm which has touched so many lives along the East Coast. We are doing everything we can in our operations to help support the recovery effort.", "Now returning to Exxon Mobil\u2019s results; but before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our customary cautionary statement shown on Slide 2.", "Moving to Slide 3, we provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global economic uncertainty continued in the third quarter with further weakness in Europe and Japan. The European growth rate is estimated to remain negative in the third quarter following the contraction in the second quarter. Meanwhile, Japan is likely to decelerate further. The US economy marginally improved versus the second quarter and China\u2019s growth rate decline moderated versus prior quarters.", "Energy markets improved in the third quarter with higher crude oil and US natural gas prices and stronger industry refining margins versus the second quarter. Although, US commodity chemical margins remained strong, Europe and Asia margins showed continued weakness.", "Turning now to the third quarter of financial results as shown on Slide 4; Exxon Mobil\u2019s third quarter 2012 earnings were $9.6 billion, a decrease of $760 million from the third quarter of 2011. Earnings per share for the quarter were $2.09, down $0.04 from a year ago.", "The corporation distributed $7.6 billion to shareholders in the third quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $5 billion was distributed to purchase shares. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012.", "CapEx in the third quarter was $9.2 billion, up 7% from the third quarter of 2011. Our cash generation remained strong with $14 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales. At the end of the third quarter 2012, cash totaled $13.3 billion and debt was $12.4 billion.", "The next slide provides additional detail on third quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter, cash decreased from $18 billion to $13.3 billion. The combined impact of strong earnings, depreciation expense and the benefit of our ongoing asset management program yielded $14 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales.", "Uses included additions to plant, property and equipment or PP&E of $8 million and shareholder distributions of $7.6 billion. Additional financing and investing activities decreased our cash by $3.1 billion, primarily due to the redemption of the SeaRiver deferred interest debentures.", "Moving on to Slide 6 and a review of our segment results; Exxon Mobil\u2019s third quarter 2012 earnings of $9.6 billion decreased $760 million or 7% from the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to lower gains from asset sales and lower upstream volumes, partly offset by higher refining margins.", "Upstream earnings decreased $2.4 billion, while downstream earnings improved by $1.6 billion. Chemical earnings were down $213 million and corporate and financing expenses were favorable by $263 million, primarily due to tax items. Guidance for corporate and financing expenses remained at $500 million to $700 million per quarter.", "As shown on Slide 7, Exxon Mobil\u2019s third quarter 2012 earnings decreased by $6.3 billion compared with the second quarter of 2012, mainly due to lower gains on asset sales.", "Moving next to third quarter business highlights and beginning on Slide 8; we continue to advance our global portfolio of high quality upstream projects. In Nigeria, the Satellites Phase 1 project continues to progress towards first oil in the fourth quarter of 2012. Drilling has commenced on two of the three platforms. The project will have a peak capacity of 70,000 gross barrels per day.", "The Kearl Initial Development Project is now 98% complete and phased startup activities are underway. Mining operations have commenced and ore is being stockpiled adjacent to the ore processing plant. Commissioning of the ore processing plant and utility systems are progressing and the diluent and natural gas supply systems are operational.", "Construction is also progressing at the Papua New Guinea LNG project which remains on schedule for a 2014 startup. In the third quarter, we completed both the hydro testing of the 250 mile offshore pipeline and structural steel construction on the LNG plant trains. Drilling commenced at Hides with the first of two rigs and the final site preparation is underway for the second drilling rig.", "Turning now to slide nine and an update on our Gulf of Mexico opportunities. At Hadrian North, we drilled two appraisal wells in the quarter and we are analyzing the results and will incorporate the findings into our development planning. Our current development basis is 100,000 barrel per day capacity, new build semi-submersible floating production system. Exxon Mobil has also begun drilling our Hummer Shallow prospect located in Walker Ridge Block 674 near the Jack St. Malo development.", "Also during the quarter Exxon Mobil acquired a 20% working interest in the Phobos prospect which is five miles south of Exxon Mobil\u2019s Hadrian South discovery. Additionally, we acquired a 35% working interest in the foreign prospect located about 30 miles Northeast of Exxon Mobil\u2019s Julia discovery. Phobos is expected to spud by year end 2012 and drilling will begin at Thorn in 2013.", "Turning now to our activities in the Black Sea on Slide 10; Exxon Mobil has established the material acreage position in the Northern Black Sea across Ukraine, Romania and Russia totaling approximately 3.5 million net acres.", "In August, the Ukrainian Government awarded the offshore Skifska Block to a group of investors led by Exxon Mobil. Our bid combined the extensive deepwater experience, technological expertise, financial strength and the environmental protection capabilities of Exxon Mobil, Shell and OMV Petrom with the local expertise of the National Oil Company, Nadra Ukrainy. Exxon Mobil will be the project operator and we are currently negotiating the joint operating agreement and production sharing agreement.", "In Romania, where we had a discovery earlier in the year, we are preparing to commence additional 3D seismic acquisition in late 2012 and have begun preparations for additional exploration drilling in late 2013 or early 2014.", "In the Russian sector of the Black Sea processing of the newly acquired 3D seismic is underway. We will be utilize this information to develop our exploration drilling plans with drilling targeted to begin in late 2014 or early 2015.", "Turning to Slide 11, during the quarter, we continue to progress our strategic cooperation agreement with Rosneft. We recently completed acquisition of 2D and 3D seismic surveys in the Kara Sea. In addition, geotechnical and oceanographic data were collected of potential drill well locations. Following completion of prospect definition and permitting, exploration drilling is expected to begin in the 2014, 2015 timeframe. ", "To advance Arctic drilling technology, we've signed an agreement in September to evaluate concepts for the development of a gravity based shallow water rig that can withstand extreme ice, wind, wave and temperature conditions. The structure will be designed to be installed on the seabed, refloated and moved to multiple drilling sites. Studies have commenced on the state-of-the-art design, which could significantly increase the safety and efficiency of expiration in the Kara Sea. ", "On shore West Siberia, we are developing a work program for selective Rosneft license blocks which will include geological studies and drilling, with drilling planned as early as next year. A pilot program will determine the technical feasibility of developing these tight oil reserves. In support of these exploration activities, Exxon Mobil and Rosneft have been conducting technical studies on areas of interest, including visits to existing field and facilities. ", "Moving on to slide 12, we also continue to focus on high potential, liquids-rich, unconventional opportunities in North America, highlighted by activity in the Bakken, Woodford Ardmore, and Western Canada. In the United States, approximately two-thirds of our operated rigs are drilling liquids-rich opportunities, up from about 20% at the beginning of 2011. On September 20, Exxon Mobil and its subsidiary XTO Energy announced the signing of an exchange agreement with Denbury to acquire 100% of their Bakken shale assets, which consists of 196,000 net acres in North Dakota and Montana, and production is expected to be more than 15,000 net oil equivalent barrels per day when the deal closes. ", "The agreement will increase Exxon Mobil holdings in the Bakken region by about 50% to nearly 600,000 acres, resulting in a significant presence in one of the major US growth areas for onshore oil production. Additionally, this acreage is located close to current XTO development areas generating further efficiencies. The Woodford Shale and the Ardmore basin of Southern Oklahoma comprises our most active unconventional drilling program with 10 operated rigs delineating and developing more than 260,000 net acres of leaseholds. ", "In addition, we are advancing infrastructure projects to optimize the liquids-rich production from this area. For example, construction was recently completed on a 117 mile natural gas gathering pipeline from our operations of Southern Oklahoma to processing facilities in North Texas. In Western Canada, Exxon Mobil announced an agreement on October 17 with Celtic Exploration in which Exxon Mobil Canada will acquire 545,000 net acres in the liquids-rich Montney shale, 104,000 net acres in the Duvernay shale and additional acreage in other areas of Alberta.", "Current gross production on the acreage to be acquired is 72 million cubic feet per day of natural gas, and 4,000 barrels per day of crude, condensate and natural gas liquids. These new assets will complement our existing North American unconventional portfolio. Our financial and technical strength will enable us to maximize resource value by leveraging the experience of XTO Energy which has expertise in developing tight gas, shale oil and gas and coal bed methane.", "Turning now to the upstream financial and operating results and starting on slide 13; upstream earnings in the third quarter was $6 billion, down $2.4 billion from the third quarter of 2011. Realizations decreased earnings by $130 million due primarily to lower crude oil and US natural gas realizations, which declined by $2.31 per barrel and $1.40 per thousand cubic feet respectively. Production mix and volume effects negatively impacted earnings by $700 million, due to the impact of lower entitlement volumes base decline and down time partly offset by the ramp up of Angola and Nigeria projects.", "All other items primarily lower gains from asset sales and unfavorable tax and foreign exchange effects decreased earnings by $1.6 billion. Upstream after tax earnings per barrel for the third quarter of 2012 were $16.39.", "Moving to slide 14, oil equivalent volumes decreased by 7.5% from the third quarter of last year, due to the impact of base decline, lower entitlement volumes, divestments and down time. Volumes were positively impacted by the ramp up of projects in Angola and Nigeria. Excluding the impacts of the entitlement volumes, OPEC quarter effects and divestments, production was down 2.9%. ", "Turning now to sequential comparison starting on slide 15; upstream earnings decreased by $2.4 billion versus the second quarter of 2012. Higher crude oil and US natural gas realizations positively impacted earnings by $340 million. As crude oil realizations increased by $0.77 per barrel and US gas realization increased $0.54 per thousand cubic feet. Production mix and volume effects decreased earnings by $540 million due to base decline, down time, lower entitlement volumes and seasonal demand in Europe. Other items including lower gains from asset sales and higher expenses decreased earnings by $2.2 million. ", "Moving to slide 16, oil equivalent volumes were down 4.6% from the second quarter of 2012 due to down time, base decline, seasonal demand in Europe and lower entitlement volumes, partly offset by the ramp up of projects in Angola. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes OPEC quota effects and divestments production was down 3.6%.", "On slide 17, we showed the year-to-date 2012 volumes associated with the expected 3% full year decline provided at the analyst meeting in March. Operational performance through the third quarter was slightly below forecast, reflecting the timing of work program execution, duration of down time events, particularly in the North Sea and the efficient use of capital in Iraq which is lower net volumes. Additionally, the continued focus on enhancing profitability through the shifting of North American drilling to liquids-rich opportunities has contributed to the variance. ", "While the year-to-date Brent crude price of $112 per barrel is near the basis of our March Analyst meeting outlook, prices in the first half of 2012 mostly notably in February through April were higher than our outlook, which negatively affected volumes due to both permanent and price related entitlement. Fourth quarter volumes will be supported by seasonal demand, project startups and completion of schedule downtime.", "Moving now to the downstream financial and operating results and starting on slide 18. Downstream earnings in the third quarter were $3.2 billion, up 1.6 billion from the third quarter of 2011, as we continue to optimize our refineries by fully utilizing operational and fleet flexibility and the integration with lubes and chemical. ", "Improved margins mainly in North American and European refining increased earnings by $850 million. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $20 million, due to lower earnings associated with asset sold largely offset by favorable refining optimization effects. Other items included a gain on the sale of our downstream business in Switzerland, favorable ForEx and lower operating expenses increased earnings by $780 million. ", "Turning to slide 19, sequentially third quarter downstream earnings decreased by $3.5 billion. Improved margins primarily in refining increased earnings by $650 million. Volume and mix effects, mainly driven by lower plan maintenance and refining optimization activity increased by $300 million. Other items reduced earnings by $4.4 billion, primarily due to the absence of a gain associated with the Japan restructuring, partly offset by the gain from the sale of our downstream business along with favorable ForEx and lower operating experience expenses. ", "Moving now to the chemical, financing and operating results and starting on slide 20, third quarter chemical earnings was $790 million, down $213 million versus the third quarter of 2011. Margins decreased earnings by a $150 million namely due to lower olefins, and polyethylene utilization. Other items decrease earnings by $60 million, mainly due to unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. ", "Moving to slide 21; sequentially third quarter chemical earnings decreased by $659 million. Weaker margins mainly in Europe decreased earnings by $90 million. Other items, primarily the absence of the gain associated with the Japan restructuring, decreased earnings by $590 million. ", "Moving to slide 22, Exxon Mobil\u2019s third quarter financial and operating performance reflects the value of our integrated business model and other competitive advantages. We earned $9.6 billion, generated $14 billion in cash flow, invested $9.2 billion in the business and distributed $7.6 billion to our shareholders. ", "As we continue to focus on operational excellence, deploy high impact technologies and leverage our unparallel global integration. Exxon Mobil remains well positioned to maximize long-term shareholder value. ", "That concludes my prepared remarks. I would now be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Rosenthal. (Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America", "", "I've got a couple please, one-on-one follow-up I should say. I understand at the Analyst Day you gave as an indication that production would be done this year but it seems that it\u2019s slicing a little harder than certainly we expected and at the same time the capture rate that is you know as the earnings against your weighted revenues has deteriorated somewhat this quarter. So I am just wondering if there's, that you still feel confident in the medium-term outlook and if you have something unusual in this quarter in part to the earnings capture and I\u2019ve got a quick follow-up please.", "David Rosenthal", "Let me first address Doug the volume decline. As I mentioned in the chart, my prepared remarks, we are only slightly below what the outlook would have generated if not for again as I mentioned the price and entitlement effects of the higher crude prices earlier in the year and some divestments. I will say that when you look at the slight underperformance if you will on the operation side, a piece of that effect, a big piece of that bar is the fact that we've been able to generate the production volumes that we were looking to get in Iraq with less capital being expended. So because we expended less capital and we are more efficient. We didn't get as many barrels back. ", "We've also had some extended downtime a little more than we thought particularly in the North Sea and some other areas but other than that just some timing and some work program and some of the other things I mentioned but other than that we are pretty much online with what we were looking at. ", "If you are looking at the capture rate in particular in the upstream, I think the biggest driver there of course is going to be the mix of the volumes that we had and where we had some of that downtime across the quarter in Kazakhstan and some other areas that we had some downtime North Sea, etcetera, other than that when you look at the other earnings effects not a lot in there in terms of items other than the fact that we were about a billion less quarter-over-quarter, this quarter on asset divestitures. So I think if you sort those things out, we're pretty much as we would have expected to be.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America", "Great. Thank you. My follow-up there is hopefully fairly quick. There is always been a lot of other deltas this quarter, the other items that you talked about but again, just like last quarter, they are not as big but they are still fairly sizeable particularly in the downstream. So I guess there is two points to my question. The first one is, would you be able to quantify the absolute impacts of the major parts from disposals in the foreign exchange effects as opposed to the relative impact and this is an observation. At what point, or what is the philosophical reason for not providing the absolutes on a quarterly basis because it would be extremely helpful if you were able to do that?", "David Rosenthal", "Doug, let me have a couple of those. First of all, foreign exchange is one that\u2019s impossible to give an absolute because you got both changes and impacts on your working capital balances. Those are specific. But when you are looking at the impacts on the earnings, it's really just a translation of margins and OpEx using exchange rates last quarter and this quarter. So you don\u2019t have an absolute amount on that. ", "If we look across the corporation though, I will tell you that quarter-to-quarter, the impact was very small and I am happy to talk about the details. If we go specifically to the downstream earnings, I think which is one you are interested in, if I am looking at downstream earnings, third quarter of \u201812 versus third quarter of \u201811, again you saw the nice margin bump there of $850 million that\u2019s really clean, there is no lag effects or other things in there. We were just able to have all of our operations running strong and take advantage of the strong market that we saw there. ", "On a $780 million, if I move over to the other column, I am happy to give you some additional color there. The biggest part in there was about just under $400 million for our divestments in the quarter favorable FOREX quarter-versus-quarter was another $300 million and the balance was favorable OpEx and that pretty much takes that out. Volume pretty minimal where we lost volumes in some of the divested assets we were able to make up those earnings by higher volumes and throughput and some of our other operations.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.", "", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "Yeah, I just have a question related to the Celtic acquisition in the quarter and does this deal reflect any change or evolution in Exxon\u2019s view of potential Canadian or British Columbian specific LNG export potential with your bigger Montney position now?", "David Rosenthal", "I don\u2019t think it changes any of our views or thoughts we have going forward. The Celtic acquisition gives us an opportunity to pick up as I said about 545,000 net acres in the Montney that most of that acreage is near acreage we already have. So it\u2019s very helpful to us. And it\u2019s just a continuation of what you have seen for the last couple of years where we have taken advantage of opportunities to go out and acquire large tracks of promising acreage with high upside potential and both goes on to the XTO acquisition and in particular, I think what you have noticed over the last year or so is these acquisitions have tended to be more liquids-rich properties than the gas things that we added early on. So no change, I will say though that of course this gives us tremendous opportunities across North America, all of which we are looking at and as you mentioned.", "I think we mentioned before that we are in the early stages of assessing potential export options from Alaska from Western Canada and from the US Gulf Coast. So we are fortunate to have large resources in each of those areas and again as we develop our plans and go forward, I will have to more to say about that. But I would say it\u2019s really a continuation of the strategy that we\u2019ve had in place now for the last couple of years.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley", "That's great, and may be just one other follow-up if I may to those question, I mean on relating to upstream volumes. Can you quantify or discuss the turnaround activity [legacy] contributed to what\u2019s your defining lower operational performance and I guess specifically and I guess your comments that may not but just confirm that does not or you don\u2019t see that extending into the fourth quarter and I\u2019ll leave it to that things?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure, if you look at, I think the best place to look at really where we see any impact of this downtime. If you look quarter-on-quarter, third quarter of \u201812 versus third quarter of \u201811 over in the net growth where we have the minus 125 about 40 of that is downtime across the number of areas most of its scheduled, you are well aware of we had some downtime at Qatar, Alaska and the North Sea and so that impact showed up there.", "You also see it, particularly if you are looking sequentially because as you know a lot of this downtime is seasonal, but the downtime effect between the third quarter this year and the second quarter of this year was about 90 KBD. So a significant effect; most of that production is pretty much back-up. We do have some continued downtime and operated by other\u2019s properties in the North Sea, but other than that the rest of the production is coming up as we would have expected heading into the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question will comes from Robert Kessler with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.", "Robert Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt", "", "A couple of quick ones from me. One, your US natural gas volumes declining quite considerably sequentially, I'm wondering if there's any anomalous items in there and of course we had hurricanes, I wouldn't have thought you would have been disproportionately exposed to that, what can we assume for a say normal decline rate in your US natural gas volumes going forward?", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah, if you look sequentially at our US gas I mean we had a little bit of impact from weather related activity, but it wasn\u2019t large. You did see a decline sequentially of about 5%. Some of that was downtime, but the majority of it was kind of base decline and really the impact you are seeing as we are shifting rigs from drilling primarily gas plays to drilling liquid focused plays. And so the total rig count is down across the year and the proportion that's drilling liquids rich plays versus gas has gone up and so I think between that and some downtime that really accounts for the bulk of the reason we are down. As you look forward, I really don't have an outlook for you. It will be dependent on how we bring things along in the market and that sort of thing, but clearly you are seeing the impact of our changing focus from drygas to liquids rich opportunity.", "Robert Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt", "And then a conceptual one from me on M&A; your recent North American focused transactions have of course further increased your upstream weighting of capital employed to North America. Your US weighting alone was I think 46% in the upstream capital employed at the end of last year. Looking at future acquisition possibilities conceptually does Exxon Mobil apply any limit to the capital you plan to deploy to North America or would you continue to look at potential North American M&A the same way you look at opportunities globally?", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah, let me step back, that's a good question. As we step back and look at our total capital budget and where we put our CapEx, we really don't have any limits in terms of type of resource or geographic focus. We pursue all of the attractive opportunities that are out there. As you look across the last several years you tended to see us sometime putting more CapEx into oilsands or unconventional plays or LNG, but all of that is really reflective of the opportunities as they are presented and our ability with our strong financial strength to basically take advantage of anything that's out there that's on offer that we think will provide shareholder value.", "As you've seen over the last couple of years, the bulk of that has been through internally generated CapEx, but there's also been some selective acquisitions and so I would say going forward you'll see us continuing to do what we've been doing, which is to look at all the opportunities that are out there on offer and taking advantage of any opportunity we have to really enhance the portfolio of our assets with the focus continued on the long term, you know, if you look at all the things we've been doing over the last couple of years, they are all focused on bringing really long term legacy projects up and get them running and then continuing to add to our resource space, our opportunities for the future. So I wouldn't see anything different going forward than what we've been doing; but we will continue to look for attractive opportunities wherever they present themselves.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next, we will hear from Doug Terreson with ISI.", "Doug Terreson - ISI", "Some of the global competitors are indicating that global oil demand maybe gravitating lower again and on this point, given your global perspective, I wanted to see if you could provide insight into some of the demand trends that Exxon Mobil is seeing around the world and specifically whether you guys are witnessing any deterioration in this area?", "And then second, just for Exxon specifically, R&M was clearly strong in the quarter, but the company didn\u2019t seem to benefit to the degree that some of the competitors did and while you talked about some of the cost factors a minute ago, was there anything unusual on downtime, either planned or unplanned that affected results and if so do you have any quantification in that area?", "David Rosenthal", "Let me start at the first one there with the global oil demand, I don't think we're seeing anything different than what others are seeing and what you're reading in the press in terms of demand particularly say in Europe and Japan and some other areas. We\u2019ll be putting out our own update here in December on our view of global oil demand, but, again from our perspective, I wouldn't have anything to offer any different than what you are seeing out there, what you are talking about.", "Doug Terreson - ISI", "Okay.", "David Rosenthal", "The R&M results, as you mentioned, were really strong. Again, I have to say, you know, we were able to have very good operations up time able to take advantage in particular in the U.S. of the discounted feeds, both heavy Canadian feeds as well as WTI linked crude and so we are optimizing those across our Mid-Continent refineries and you are seeing some of those impacts showing up in the bottomline. If you are looking at downtime, I think it was the rest of your comment in the downstream?", "", "Doug Terreson - ISI", "Yeah, was it unusual in the period?", "", "David Rosenthal", "You saw a little bit more in the second quarter and less in the third quarter as we came out just to give you a little more color, if you were looking sequentially from third quarter of \u201912 on to again, I am sorry the third quarter versus the second quarter, we did see some lower OpEx of somewhere between $100 million and $200 million you would have seen there to the quarters and that would have helped that. But again, the bulk of the earnings driven by good operations and favorable margin impacts.", "", "Operator", "Thank you. And next we\u2019ll hear from Allen Good with Morningstar Investment.", "", "Allen Good - Morningstar Investment", "Just a question on the M&A; obviously you mentioned some of the activities you have had relatively probably a little bit more than some of your competitors off late. Can you talk a little bit about the characteristics that Exxon looks at when you go out there and survey those market opportunities that are out there and some of the things that may be you have learned from XTO since acquisition as far as what may be the better plays or any sort of knowledge you have gained from XTO that helps you to better delineate on those market opportunities as far as acquisitions go?", "", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah let me, I\u2019ll actually start with your second question and back up in to the first. Clearly, one of the synergies that we anticipated getting with the XTO acquisition that have been realized in the last couple of years is the ability to utilize the expertise and now as they had combined with some of our technology advances to better analyze and evaluate properties that are out there.", "And you\u2019ve seen that, if you look at some of the acquisitions we made in the U.S. of properties and some of the deals we have done elsewhere and up in Canada, a lot of the ability to properly evaluate the resource potential of those properties and assign value to them stems from directly from the organization that came with the XTO acquisition and that is working just as we had planned.", "As you look at M&A or any other resource opportunity capture, we look for the same thing in all of them. We do have a high quality large resource with upside potential; that has to be number one. Do we think we can bring some synergistic value to those reserves and perhaps get a better return than someone else could and that comes from either technology that we bring to the table, R&D work or operational expertise that allows us to then again get a better value for that and they might otherwise would have. And then we look for other more obvious synergies around contiguous properties to what we have or other ways of filling in a portfolio to perhaps be able to pursue a larger strategy. So M&A versus outright capture of these resources, the criteria for us remains the same and we really don't differentiate between the two.", "Allen Good - Morningstar Investment", "And then just second question, could you update us on the North America rig count. I believe you were close to 250 in the last quarter and you Don mentioned that I think over half of it is in liquids-rich place, are you continuing to move drilling away from dry gas at this stage.", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah, as we look to cross the quarter we ended at about 50 rigs. We are probably close to that today maybe a rig or two less as we speak, and two-thirds of those rigs are drilling the liquids-rich opportunities and in particular I mentioned the Woodford Ardmore is an area of high activity for us, the Bakken of course, an area of high activity and the Permian is another area of high activity for us. So you do see this shift going into the areas that are more liquids-rich. As you go forward without giving any specific counts, you could expect to see us continuing to pursue those liquids-rich opportunities particularly in the areas that I mentioned, but I don't have a specific outlook for you in terms of total rig count going forward.", "Operator", "Next we will heal from Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil", "", "You briefly mentioned LNG and I was hoping you could maybe give us an update on where you stand in the application process out of the US Gulf Coast and then maybe more broadly you kind of mentioned the potential from Western Canada, Alaska. Could you maybe rank order where you see the best opportunities if possible, I know its early days yet but.", "David Rosenthal", "Sure, let's start with the Golden Pass opportunity that we are assessing. We did early in October, we received authorization from the US Department of Energy to export domestically produced natural gas as LNG from Golden Pass to nations that have existing Free Trade Agreements. So we do have that approval in hand. I can also tell you that we have recently filed an application with the US Department of Energy to explore LNG to non-FDA countries, and we will see how that application process proceeds. ", "I have to say that when we look at all of these activities, they really are all in the early days and no decisions have been made. Again, we are very fortunate to have a material high quality gas resource in both the US Gulf Coast and in Western Canada and Alaska, and it would be way premature to try to rank order those other than to say they are all high quality resources for us and we are looking at all of the options available to monetize those resources including again early days on assessing the viability of LNG exports from anyone of those three regions.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil", "Yeah, fair enough. The second question was on the Gulf of Mexico shelf, as I understand that you had formed maybe a JV with a smaller EMT player to target I guess a deep oil play similar to what some of your peers are doing on the gas side for deep gas. I'm just curious if you had any updates on that, and if I'm not mistaken there was going to be a well [spun] toward the end of the year.", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah, I don't have a specific update with regard to that joint venture. We do have that transaction as was publicly discussed, but I really wouldn't have any update particularly near term on what our activities are going to be on that. And I'll just mention though if you look across the broader Gulf of Mexico, you do see a nice increase in activity as we continue to develop some of these properties that we have captured over the last couple of years ", "I mentioned some of those in our prepared remarks and we're very excited about getting some of these wells down and continuing to broader exploration phase, which as you mentioned, has a number of partners and a number of structures but all in a very good opportunity for us and one we're pursuing pretty quickly.", "Operator", "The next question will come from Arjun Murti with Goldman Sachs.", "Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs", "Just a few follow ups on some of the North America type question. So you have been pretty clear you pulled back on some of the gas drilling in the US and we saw a little bit of that decline show up. When you kind of slow down the drilling in unconventional, the decline is going to be pretty precipitous. So just wondering maybe the follow up to the earlier question, you know, is 5% just the beginning of what could be a more rapid decline in your gas production or is there something that is not fully apples-to-apples about this decline and it won't be as bad or worse going forward?", "David Rosenthal", "I don\u2019t have a specific outlook for you, Arjun, but I will note that there are a number of factors in addition to just some of the shifting of these rigs. We did have some downtime in the quarter, and if you look at this year versus last year, you will recall we did have some asset sales last year and we're seeing a little bit of that. But again, if you look just over the couple of last quarter in particular, downtime and then just normal decline associated with this, but I don\u2019t have a decline rate for you or go-forward in outlook. We will see how things go. I will tell you, in some areas, we've been actually able to keep the volumes flat, while reducing the rigs due to efficiencies we have gained, rates of drilled wells and that sort of thing. So we have been able to offset some of this decline in rigs with some improved operations and productivity.", "", "Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs", "In terms of the shift Dave to liquids-rich would you say you have made the shift now or is there still more gas rigs to come out of the rig count?", "", "David Rosenthal", "What you will see as we\u2019ll continue to have this focus on the liquids-rich place exactly how many more rigs might move I don\u2019t have a specific number for you. We do have contractual obligations that we have to meet and other commitments which will keep us drilling some dry gas wells, but we evaluate this thing on an ongoing basis literally day-to-day and month-to-month in terms of how we optimize the rigs we have available to us, what the market is generating, or how the wells are performing. So I really wouldn\u2019t have a forward look for you.", "", "Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs", "And Dave may be just lastly on the same topic, clearly you are increasingly are some liquids-rich, you mentioned the Permian, the Bakken some of these places. In terms of having that show up visibly in your US liquids oil volumes, I\u2019m going to assume there is some lag for that to happen none that you can comment on that at all?", "", "David Rosenthal", "You are seeing that show up in the liquids volumes as some of this ramp up; and again most of what we have been doing in these areas for the last several months is been delineating what we have, appraising what we have been doing, looking at what the optimum parameters are for developing thee fields. So now you are starting to see us ramp up on the production side particularly in the Bakken where we are up, I think just under 50% year-on-year if you look at the third quarter. So you are starting to see some of that. ", "You will start to see some of that in the other areas as well; the Woodford Ardmore for example and the Permian as we continue to move into more of a development mode. So I don't have the number for you other then to say yes, if you look at those fairly small declined rates on US liquids, you are seeing the impact of normal decline on our conventional field being offset somewhat by ramp ups in some of those other areas.", "I will say, if you take out the Alaska and just look at the lower 48, our liquids volumes are actually up quarter-versus-quarter and sequentially. So, some of that downtime is masking some of that performance.", "Arjun Murti - Goldman Sachs", "That's helpful, thank you so much.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Faisel Khan with Citi Group.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "I want to go back to the production outlook for a second. In your analyst meeting, you guys discussed how production capacity will grow at some blade through 2015, and given your comments around decreased drilling of national gas in US also so that matter decreased investment in Iraq and potentially an exit from southern Iraq and I am just trying to figure out how does this impact your future production capacity gross targets, and to that reserve replacement too?", "David Rosenthal", "First of all, I don't have a new outlook on the outer years. We are just in the process of pulling our plan together and looking at what the future looks like. I don't have any updates, and of course we will provide an update in March at the Analyst meeting. I will say if you look at all the big projects that we have gone on out there that we've been building for sometime. Those are all in the process of starting up as planned. The projects we had this year in Angola and Nigeria as we look out a little further of course the start up of the Kearl project and then as we move into the following years the Banyu Urip project in Indonesia and all the other launch projects Papua New Guinea LNG (inaudible) Gorgon, all of those projects that we got still going in the ground, all of those are still in the plan and that portfolio remains very strong. So I don't have an update around on that. And the second part of your question Faisel.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Yeah David on Southern Iraq, I mean what are your plans in the country?", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah, if we look at Iraq, the comment I made was we are now producing right at about 430,000 barrels a day of oil right on plan and the good news is strictly that we've been able to do that a little more efficiently than we had expected but I don't have any other update on Iraq other than that. We continue to work and continue to meet our contractual commitments.", "Faisel Khan - Citigroup", "Just one last question, on your chemicals business, on the expansion of your Singapore facility can you give us a status update on that and what (inaudible) facility is operating, its up and running and if you are moving products into the markets.", "David Rosenthal", "Sure. The simple answer would be yes to all three of those questions. The project is nearing mechanical completion and as we talked about before several of the various pieces of that project have been progressively starting up. We were able to produce for example metallocene based polymers here earlier in the year. We do have product qualification activities underway for those products. So the overall project is coming right along. The very last project to reach mechanical completion is the steam cracker and we do expect completion of that by year end. ", "So we would certainly expect to be mechanically complete and on track for starting that large investment up and moving that product into the market. So the project is doing well. The Asia Pacific area as you well know is kind of looking at bottom of cycle margins right now. Not surprisingly that remains a cyclical business and one of our strengths has been for a long time investing through these cycles with very strong a year or two ago, it\u2019s weak now, this project as you can well imagine is really designed for the long-term while we remain very bullish on growth in that part of the area. ", "So the long-term view remains the same. The project is on schedule to start up and to be mechanically complete by the end of the year and then we will progress the ramp up of that as we go through the first part of next year.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.", "Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James", "", "Two quick ones on Celtic if I may, as I'm sure you saw the Canadian government recently vetoed a purchase by another operator of a domestic oil & gas company. Any concerns about getting approvals for the Celtic purchase?", "David Rosenthal", "Our approval process is the same as everyone else\u2019s and we are progressing through that. We have a long history of operating in Canada. We've been there a long time and we are looking forward to getting through the approval process and closing on that deal and moving forward with our plans for those resources.", "Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James", "Okay and assuming the deal goes through and given what you said about curtailing dry gas drilling across North America, is it safe to say that you would pull back on the current, relative to the current level of drilling activity across Celtic\u2019s acreage?", "David Rosenthal", "I don\u2019t have any outlook today on exactly what specifics we would be doing with that once the deal closes. The deal hasn\u2019t closed yet. So it would be premature for me to make any comments about our plans going forward.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next we will hear from Edward Westlake with Credit Suisse.", "Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse", "Just two quick earnings questions. If I turn to slide 15, this is the upstream sequential 3Q to 2Q. Obviously there is a $2.2 billion negative other and $1.1 billion of it is assets sales but can you give us some color on to what the other $1 billion is in terms of the changes, for downstream, that\u2019s helpful.", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah, if you're looking at this sequential, this is the sequential that you're looking at.", "Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse", "Yeah, 2Q versus 3Q.", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah, there are couple of other factors in there. OpEx is a negative $200 million, foreign exchange is a negative $100 million and then the combination of asset sales and tax items is about $1.8 million. And the main driver of the OpEx and tax related, we did have the change in the UK tax but if you roll it all up, just think about OpEx a couple hundred million, FOREX $100 million, taxes a $100 million in the balance in the asset sales and tax items.", "Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse", "And those tax items were, were any of those deferred whether it was ongoing? ", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah, some of those were deferred.", "", "Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse", "And then just on the chemical business in the US, obviously Baytown had some disruption in the first half I guess 3Q was it been a good result, is that a fair kind of run rate for the macro conditions that we are in Q3 or were there any disruptions in the US portfolio for chemicals?", "David Rosenthal", "No, we didn\u2019t really have any disruptions of any consequence kind of normal operations and nothing really to speak off kind of like the downstream; our chemical operations ran well in the third quarter and no major items.", "", "Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse", "", "And then coming to my question on cash and buybacks etcetera, obviously [Europe] your ending cash at the end of the quarter was lower than the beginning of the quarter because $14 billion of cash flow doesn\u2019t cover the dividend plus buybacks plus the spent on this large mega projects. Are you comfortable to let cash balances fold or is this some kind of statements about the future cash earnings power of Exxon as these big projects come on which means that ultimately this level of buybacks is appropriate?", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah, I think the first thing I will note Ed is that we did spend $3 billion of our cash when the SeaRiver debentures matured in the quarter. So that was a $3 billion hit there. In terms of overall strategy around cash, no change in our approach there, we maintained sufficient cash to run the operations and keep our flexibility for doing other things in the business but really don\u2019t have any particular change or outlook in terms of cash or debt. We will just optimize that as we go forward depending on business conditions.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next we will hear from Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays ", "I have pleased for three really short questions. First, on the versus the second quarter, you indicate that production job 39,000 barrels per day due to entitlement, I would assume that's all we need to change in [POV] in some of your project. The question is that do you any major projects about to change their POVs that over the next one to two years?", "David Rosenthal", "Let me talk about the first one. I will give you a little more color on that 39,000 barrels a day Paul. It was about half was permitted to net interest impacts and the other half was on price and expense, so kind of a mixture there and neither one of having a significant impact. Going forward when we look at near-term production of course the biggest factor for us is the price because that drives how many barrels you get to recover your cost as well as how quickly through the transit. ", "So looking forward here particularly near-term, I don't have an outlook number to provide you specific to what the sequential price expend impacts might be but again the biggest factor there is crude price.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "Do you have any major project that is above, that potentially could be they move to the next [PR] ratio within the next one or two years, you have the current oil price stay?", "David Rosenthal", "Paul, I really I don't have any specifics along those lines in terms of our project by project. We will really talk again about the make up of our volumes going forward when we visit with you in March and so I\u2019ll probably just hold any comments about future volume outlooks to that time when we can kind of ramp in the whole story for you.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "Okay, can you tell us that what is your total share oil production in the third quarter or as of this point and breakout between the oil and gas.", "David Rosenthal", "If you are looking at our unconventional volumes, you know I don't have a total for you on that Paul or a split between oil & gas, you know I think the important thing is as you are looking at the progress that we are making against some of these improvements we are making year-over-year in the Bakken in particular for example and some of the other areas. I think that the progress we are making in those fields particularly as we transition from delineation and appraisal into more development is probably more important than the absolute production that we are seeing on that and the progress that we are making, but I really don't have a specific number for you.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital", "Just quick one, last one, do you have the absolute venue of the after sales (inaudible) in the quarter and also do you have any meaningful inventory gains or price finalization impact for your long haul [barrel] under water in this quarter.", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah, let me hit that second question and then I will back up to the first one. If you look at the absolute number in the third quarter, it\u2019s almost zero in terms of all the price timing, price finalization, long haul crudes. We did have a negative effect in the second quarter, but if you look at our absolute results in the third quarter there really wasn\u2019t anything there. And then if you were looking at the absolute value of the divestments in the third quarter, that was about $400 million and the biggest item there was the downstream divestment of our business in Switzerland.", "Operator", "And next we will hear from Ian Reid with Jefferies.", "Iain Reid - Jefferies", "I just got a couple of quick questions about your international assets. On Kurdistan, do you want to give us your thinking about the drilling program there and when we should be looking forward to the results etcetera.", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah, Iain I have to say I really don't have any comments on Kurdistan at all to offer today.", "Iain Reid - Jefferies", "", "Really, but you do have a program going on there.", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah, like I said I really just don't have any comment on Kurdistan today.", "Iain Reid - Jefferies", "", "Okay. Papua New Guinea, what's the status of the planning for train 3. You obviously mentioned pretty good mentioned from the first two trains. I believe train 3 is in the works that when should we look for FID on that.", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah, let me first back up just a second and let you know that our primary focus of course is on our existing projects. That project has come along very well and we are on schedule for startup in 2014 and that's our primary focus. If you look at how we are doing on the exploration side, I think we have a number of opportunities in the area and we have a very active broad explorations program going on. We have had some success this year in the Tingyang well. So that's looking good.", "Obviously as we continue to evolve and mature our resource space in the area, we will be looking at options for monetizing those resources and I can\u2019t give you any outlook in terms of when we will make final decisions on any opportunities but we are in the early stages looking up we have, thinking about what we might want to do and I would of course include a potential additional train of Papua New Guinea but all of that will be depending upon the exploration success that we have and how we look going forward but in the meantime, I think the really positive news for the shareholders is the project is progressing and progressing well. And the areas are looking very promising for us.", "Iain Reid - Jefferies", "Could just comment on PNG, I know you didn\u2019t take up the form out, which also is offering in the exploration areas. Does that kind of indicates, you got enough of PNG or what was you thinking there?", "David Rosenthal", "I wouldn't want to make any comment on any thoughts or rumors or speculation on deals that we've done or not done. We're looking at a lot of things but again I wouldn't make any specific comment on any particular potential transactions.", "Iain Reid - Jefferies", "Okay, so the last one. I think you can help me with. West Siberia tight oil what's the kind of structure of the contracts or the agreement there with Rosneft. Are you carrying them through this or what are the kind of, any idea about outlying cost and volumes etcetera?", "David Rosenthal", "If you are looking at West Siberia, we are as I mentioned looking at, we're already actively studying and what we are going to do in that pilot program, hope to get a well down in the first quarter. In terms of specific details of the commercial arrangements there, probably, premature to be talking about that given where we are in the stage. So I won't be able to help you on that question after all.", "Iain Reid - Jefferies", "But you do have 30% interest, is that the way it would?", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah, it\u2019s two-thirds, one-third Rosneft and Exxon Mobil.", "", "Operator", "At this time, we have no further questions in the queue. Mr. Rosenthal, I will turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.", "David Rosenthal", "I would just like to thank everybody for your participation today. I know many of you are probably participating under some probably fairly difficult personal situation. So I wish you all the best. In that regard, thanks for the good questions and I\u2019ll look forward to seeing you in about three months. So thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Operator", "Good day, and welcome to the ExxonMobil Corporation Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's fourth quarter earnings call and webcast. The focus of this call is ExxonMobil's financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2012. I will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website.", "Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2.", "Moving to Slide 3, we provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global economic growth remained weak in the fourth quarter, driven by the U.S., Japan and Europe. Preliminary fourth quarter U.S. GDP showed a slight decline of 0.1%. The Japanese and European economies remain challenged, with Japan experiencing its second recession in 3 years, and Europe likely marginally positive. Meanwhile, China's growth rate showed some improvement, reflecting an upturn in industrial production and higher retail sales. Energy markets were mixed in the fourth quarter, with higher U.S. natural gas prices and relatively flat Brent crude oil prices, while WTI's prices declined. European and Asian chemical margins showed improvement. However, global industry refining margins deteriorated significantly versus the third quarter.", "Turning now to the fourth quarter financial results as shown on Slide 4, ExxonMobil's fourth quarter 2012 earnings were just under $10 billion, an increase of $550 million from the fourth quarter of 2011. Earnings per share for the quarter were $2.20, up $0.23 from a year ago. The corporation distributed $7.6 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $5 billion was used to repurchase shares. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $5 billion in the first quarter of 2013. CapEx in the fourth quarter was $12.4 billion, up 24% from the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily due to the Denbury transaction. Our cash generation remains strong with $14 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales. At the end of the fourth quarter 2012, cash totaled $9.9 billion and debt was $11.6 billion.", "The next slide provides additional detail on fourth quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter, cash decreased from $13.3 billion to $9.9 billion. The combined impact of strong earnings, depreciation expense, working capital and the benefit of our ongoing asset management program yielded $14 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included additions to plant, property and equipment, or PP&E, up $10.1 billion and shareholder distributions of $7.6 billion. Additional financing and investing activities increased our cash by $300 million.", "Moving now to the full year results as shown on Slide 6, ExxonMobil's full year 2012 earnings were $44.9 billion, up $3.8 billion from 2011. Earnings per share for the year were $9.70, up $1.28 from 2011. The corporation distributed $30.1 billion to shareholders in 2012 through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $20 billion was utilized to purchase shares. CapEx in 2012 was $39.8 billion, up $3 billion from 2011, primarily due to continued progress on our world-class project portfolio, including the Kearl oil sands project. Included in full year CapEx was about $3 billion of acquisitions. Our cash generation was very strong with $63.8 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales, including $7.7 billion associated with the asset sales.", "Moving now to the full year cash flow statement as shown on Slide 7. During the year, cash decreased from $13.1 billion to $9.9 billion. The combined impact of strong earnings, depreciation expense, working capital and the benefit of our ongoing asset management program yielded $63.8 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included additions to PP&E of $34.3 billion and shareholder distributions of $30.1 billion. Additional financing and investing activities decreased cash by $2.6 billion.", "Moving on to Slide 8 and a review of our segmented results. ExxonMobil's fourth quarter 2012 earnings of just under $10 billion increased $550 million or 6% from the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily due to higher refining and chemical margins, partially offset by lower production volumes and lower gains on asset sales. Upstream earnings decreased $1.1 billion while Downstream earnings improved by $1.3 billion. Chemical earnings were up $415 million and corporate and financing expenses increased by $141 million, primarily due to tax items. Guidance for corporate and financing expenses remain at $500 million to $700 million per quarter.", "As shown on Slide 9, ExxonMobil's fourth quarter 2012 earnings increased by $380 million compared with the third quarter of 2012, primarily due to higher production volumes and gains on asset sales, partially offset by lower refining margins.", "Looking now at the full year comparison on Slide 10, ExxonMobil's full year 2012 earnings were up $3.8 billion to $44.9 billion, an increase of 9% from 2011, primarily due to divestment and restructuring gains and higher refining margins, partially offset by lower production volumes. Upstream earnings decreased $4.5 billion while Downstream earnings were up $8.7 billion and Chemical earnings were down $485 million. Corporate and financing expenses for the full year 2012 were down a favorable $118 million from 2011.", "Moving next to fourth quarter business highlights and beginning on Slide 11. We continue to advance our global portfolio of high-quality upstream projects. At the end of the fourth quarter, construction of the Kearl Initial Development was complete and we are currently progressing phased start-up activities. Mining operations have commenced and ore is being stockpiled adjacent to the ore processing plant, which is being commissioned. Commissioning of the utility systems is well advanced, with 2 boilers operational. The ore preparation plant crusher and slurry preparation conveyors also began running in December. The bitumen process facilities are being readied for the introduction of solvent, and the diluent and natural gas supply systems are operational. We expect production of mine-diluted bitumen from the first of 3 frac treatment trains in the first quarter. Startup of the 2 additional bitumen frac treatment trains will proceed in sequence as planned, with production from the initial development expected to reach volumes of approximately 110,000 barrels per day of bitumen later in 2013. Despite U.S. permitting the regulatory issues that continued for almost 2 years involving transportation of facility modules, our project team achieved industry-leading safety performance and mitigated significant challenges, including an early onset of winter and exceptionally harsh weather during the current start-up operations. Our priority remains to complete these activities safely.", "Also during the quarter, we announced our plans to develop the Hebron oilfield offshore Newfoundland and Labrador. The development, we utilized a gravity-based structure designed to withstand a variety of harsh Arctic conditions, including sea ice and icebergs. The base, which is already under construction, has been designed to store approximately 1.2 million barrels of crude oil and will support an integrated topsides deck that includes living quarters and facilities to perform drilling and production operations. Oil recovery from the project is currently estimated at 700 million barrels with upside potential. The platform is designed for production of 150,000 barrels of oil per day. First oil is anticipated around the end of 2017.", "And finally, the Angola Satellites Phase 2 project was sanctioned during the quarter. The development continues to optimize the capabilities of the existing Block 15 facilities and will allow current production levels to be increased via subsea tiebacks to our existing FPSOs.", "Turning now to Slide 12 and an update on our conventional exploration activities. In Tanzania, the Lavani-2 well successfully appraised the Lavani-1 Palaeogene discovery. Additionally, a new discovery of gas in a high-quality Cretaceous reservoir was encountered. This reservoir is of similar age to the Zafarani discovery and marked the third discovery on Block 2 in 2012. The Zafarani-2 appraisal well spud in December. Additional 3D seismic acquisition and processing is also underway and is expected to be available for analysis in the first quarter of 2013.", "Also during the quarter, ExxonMobil secured the right to farm in to a 75% operating interest in the Tugela South Exploration Right, which covers approximately 2.8 million acres offshore Durban on the East Coast of South Africa. Separately, we executed a technical cooperation permit with the government of South Africa to study the hydrocarbon potential of the Deepwater Durban Basin, covering approximately 12.4 million acres.", "In the Gulf of Mexico, the Phobos prospect, which is 5 miles South of ExxonMobil's Hadrian South discovery, spud during the quarter. Additionally, we have plans for an active exploration program in the Gulf of Mexico during 2013.", "Turning now to our unconventional exploration activities on Slide 13. In the middle of Magdalena Basin of Colombia, we drilled the Mono Arana 1 well targeting tight oil in the La Luna shale formation. This well will be tested during the first quarter of 2013. In Argentina, we have completed the drilling of 4 wells on the Loma del Molle, Los Toldos I and Los Toldos II blocks with encouraging results. Completions and testing are now underway. Two additional wells on the Sierra charter [ph] and Pampa de las Yeguas blocks are currently drilling. In Russia, Rosneft and ExxonMobil signed a Pilot Development Agreement establishing a joint project to assess the commercial production of tight oil reserves at the Bazhenov and Achimov formations in West Siberia. The joint venture is 51% Rosneft and 49% ExxonMobil. Work will be carried out on Rosneft's 23 licensed blocks, covering a total of more than 10,000 square kilometers. Drilling is anticipated to begin in 2013.", "Also, during the quarter, we closed on the Denbury transaction, which increased our holdings in the Bakken region by about 50% to approximately 600,000 net acres, giving the company a more significant presence in one of the major U.S. growth areas for onshore oil production.", "Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results and starting on Slide 14. Upstream earnings in the fourth quarter were $7.8 billion, down $1.1 billion from the fourth quarter of 2011. Lower crude oil realizations, mostly offset by improved natural gas realizations, negatively impacted earnings by $70 million, as crude oil realizations declined $3.18 per barrel and gas realizations increased $0.21 per thousand cubic feet. Production volume and mix effects negatively impacted earnings by $400 million. All other items, primarily lower gains from asset sales, decreased earnings by $600 million. Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel for the fourth quarter of 2012 were $19.65.", "Moving to Slide 15, oil equivalent volumes decreased by 5.2% from the fourth quarter of last year due to the impact of base decline, lower entitlement volumes and divestments. Volumes were positively impacted by the ramp-up of projects in West Africa and higher demand. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, production was down 2.1%.", "Turning now to the sequential comparison and starting on Slide 16. Upstream earnings increased by $1.8 billion versus the third quarter of 2012. Realizations decreased earnings by $50 million, primarily due to lower crude oil realizations, which declined $0.66 per barrel but were mostly offset by improved natural gas realizations, which increased $0.72 per thousand cubic feet. Production volume and mix effects increased earnings by $660 million. Other items, including higher gains from asset sales and favorable tax items, increased earnings by $1.2 billion.", "Moving to Slide 17. Oil equivalent volumes were up 8.4% from the third quarter of 2012, mainly due to higher seasonal demand in Europe and lower downtime, partly offset by base decline. Entitlement volumes were positive due to favorable price and spend impacts in several regions.", "Turning now to the full year comparison and starting on Slide 18. Upstream earnings were $29.9 billion in 2012, a decrease of $4.5 billion from 2011. Lower crude oil realizations, primarily in the U.S., partly offset by improved natural gas realizations, led to a negative impact of $110 million. Lower volume and mix impacts decreased earnings by $2.3 billion. All other items, including higher operating expenses, unfavorable tax items, lower gains on asset sales and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts reduced earnings by a total of $2.1 billion.", "Moving to Slide 19. Full year volumes declined by 5.9% or 267,000 oil equivalent barrels per day compared to 2011. Lower volumes were primarily driven by base decline, lower entitlement volumes and divestments, partly offset by project ramp-up in West Africa and lower downtime. Excluding the impacts of lower entitlement volumes, quotas and divestments, production was down 1.7%. For further data on regional volumes, please refer to the press release and the IR supplement.", "On Slide 20, we show actual 2012 production volumes compared to the outlook provided at the March Analyst Meeting. Overall, actual 2012 volumes were 2.7% lower than this outlook. About 1/2 of this variance was due to operational performance, with the balance due mainly to entitlement and Iraq spend impacts. Operational performance for the year was slightly below forecast, reflecting the timing of work program execution and the duration of downtime events, particularly in the U.K. North Sea. While the 2012 Brent crude price of about $112 per barrel is near the basis of our March Analyst Meeting outlook, prices in the first half of 2012, most notably February through April, were higher than our outlook basis, which negatively affected volumes due to the timing of both permanent and price-related impacts. The efficient use of capital in Iraq resulted in lower spending, which also lowered net volumes.", "Moving now to the Downstream financial and operating results and starting on Slide 21. Downstream earnings in the fourth quarter were $1.8 billion, up $1.3 billion from the fourth quarter of 2011. Improved margins, mainly in North American refining, increased earnings by $1.2 billion. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $80 million, mainly due to increased capture of advantaged North American crude supply. All other items increased earnings by a net $80 million.", "Turning to Slide 22. Sequentially, fourth quarter Downstream earnings declined by $1.4 billion. Lower refining margins decreased earnings by $1.4 billion, while volume and mix effects increased earnings by $260 million, mainly driven by optimization and yield improvements. Other items reduced earnings by $270 million, primarily due to the absence of the gain on the Switzerland divestment.", "The full year comparison for the Downstream is shown on Slide 23. Downstream full year 2012 earnings were $13.2 billion, up $8.7 billion from 2011. Higher margins, mainly in North American and European refining, increased earnings by $2.6 billion. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $180 million as refining optimization activities, including increased capture of advantaged North American crude supplies, were partly offset by higher planned maintenance activity and lower contributions from divested assets. Other effects increased earnings by $5.9 billion, mainly due to the restructuring of our Downstream holdings in Japan.", "Moving now to the Chemical financial and operating results starting on Slide 24. Fourth quarter Chemical earnings were $958 million, up $415 million versus the fourth quarter of 2011. Stronger margins increased earnings by $330 million, mainly reflecting higher aromatics realizations and improved light feed advantage. All other items increased earnings by $90 million.", "Moving to Slide 25. Sequentially, fourth quarter Chemical earnings increased by $168 million. Stronger margins, mainly due to improved aromatics realizations and improved light feed advantage, increased earnings by $180 million. All other items decreased earnings by $10 million.", "On Slide 26, we show the full year comparison for Chemical results. 2012 earnings were nearly $3.9 billion. Weaker margins, mainly in Europe and Asia, decreased earnings by $440 million, while volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $100 million. Other effects increased earnings by $50 million due to the Japan restructuring, partly offset by a number of items, including unfavorable foreign exchange impact.", "Moving to Slide 27. ExxonMobil's fourth quarter and full year financial and operating performance reflect the value of our integrated business model and other competitive advantages. In the fourth quarter, we earned just under $10 billion, generated $14 billion in cash flow, invested $12.4 billion in the business and distributed $7.6 billion to our shareholders. As we continue to focus on operational excellence, deploy high-impact technologies and leverage our unparalleled global integration, ExxonMobil remains well positioned to maximize long-term shareholder value.", "And finally, I would like to mention 2 upcoming events. First, in mid-February, we will be releasing our 2012 reserves replacement data. Second, as many of you will already have seen, our Analyst Meeting this year will take place at the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, March 6. This will include a live audio webcast beginning at 9:00 a.m. Eastern, 8:00 a.m. Central Time. ExxonMobil's presenters will be led by Chairman and CEO, Rex Tillerson. That concludes my prepared remarks. I would now be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "My question on production is for Kearl, is that weather the driver in the short-term delay in the production ramp? And should we be considering a 3-quarter ramp-up to 110,000 barrels a day, I guess, exiting the year at that capacity? And then I have a second question, please.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, the weather situation was a major factor in the startup, moving from what we had originally said by the end of the year to the first quarter. We had 2 things actually. One, weather came earlier than normal and then it has been just brutally cold up there, and so we've had to adjust accordingly. As we move through the quarter and continue progressing some of the activities I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we do expect, as that first frac treatment process comes up, that'll give us about 37,000 barrels of bitumen a day, and then we'll bring up the next 2 frac treatment trains kind of in sequence, and that'll get us up to 110,000. I don't have a specific date for achieving the 110,000 but it'll be later in the year as a function of progress that we make here across the winter, getting things started up safely. So the focus is getting the project up and running, getting that first production online and then moving forward and getting up to the full capacity that we've mentioned. And we are making really good progress this quarter, but again, it's a deliberate, diligent effort to get this thing up safely, recognizing that this is a multi-decade project and we really want to focus on getting it up right.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "That's great. And my second question, it really relates to the use of rail for oil movement in North America. And I know that Exxon has a large existing railcar fleet, a diversified and growing liquid footprint. I also read a report recently that Exxon's placed a significant railcar order recently. And so I just wondering do you see rail as a potential solution for taking [ph] barrel production in the event maybe the Keystone is delayed or denied, or if you have other kind of specified or a contemplated use for rail as a bit more permanent solution for oil movement in North America.", "David S. Rosenthal", "That's an all-encompassing question, so I'll probably step back here for just a second and put it in perspective. First of all, with relation -- or with regard to the Kearl project, we have worked all of the logistics out and we can place all of our barrels and we have the capability to run all those barrels in our own refineries for that first 110,000 barrels a day. We may elect to put some into third-party refineries, but we do not have an issue in terms of logistics, moving those barrels out of the Kearl project and into the market. As you look a little more broadly, both at the Canadian heavy crude as well as a lot of the crudes such as Bakken, until pipelines are built and some of the things that you mentioned actually come to fruition, there are, today, some bottlenecks across the industry and there's a lot of different modes of transportation being used to move that product to market, of which railcar is certainly one of them, waiting for some of these pipelines to come in. As you mentioned, we have -- or as you would expect with the size of our business, we have a very large fleet of rail cars, both across all of our businesses, and so that is already a primary mode of transportation for us. We're always looking at that. We're always looking at the logistics and how we can optimize both the placement of our production into the market as well as obtaining advantaged feedstocks for our refining circuit. And so that is an ongoing effort, and there's nothing unusual in that. In regards to the rumor that you heard, I would just say that's a rumor. I wouldn't have a comment on it specifically, but I can say there's nothing out of the ordinary in terms of what our organization, our supply organization is working on, again, getting our crudes to market for the best value and getting the lowest cost advantaged feedstocks into our refineries and chemical plants.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I've got a couple, so I'll try and be fairly quick on these. But can I deal first with the capture rate? We used to look at this quite a lot, I guess, it's now become a bit of an issue again. I'm talking about the net income as a proportion of your weighted realizations. The last -- not just in this quarter, but the last 2 or 3 quarters, it looks like it's been sliding a little bit, and I'm just wondering if there's a particular trend that you can observe there or for something that you're seeing as well, what might be behind that? And then I have a quick follow-up, please.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes. That -- yes, I know the trend you're talking about over the last couple of quarters. Of course, there's a lot of things working in there, some of the price differentials that you're seeing, some of the mix effects of where our production's coming from, some of the entitlement effects that you see there. And again, U.S. gas production and that sort of thing. So I wouldn't read anything into a couple of quarters' worth of data. We are very focused on unit profitability and working that very hard, getting some of these projects up. We have seen some increased operating expense as we brought some of these new projects up. But again, I think if you look over the longer trend and you look at the projects we've got coming on, I think that'll sort itself out, but a lot of ups and downs across the year here.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, I'll keep an eye on that one. The other one is really, I know you're not going to give me a great answer on this, at least I'm presuming, so buybacks and dividends, David, there's some chatter in the market that the sustainability of your buybacks may not be -- it might not be realistic to assume $5 billion on a quarterly basis. But you have still got very, very low net debt to cap. So I'm just curious about how management is thinking about where the balance sheet [ph] ought to be for a company given the level of your capital spending and what the priorities would be potentially for, again, for the [indiscernible]?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we're looking at another $5 billion of buybacks for the quarter. I don't have any guidance going forward, that'll be -- depend on a number of things, including commodity prices and margins. In terms of the balance sheet structure and use of debt in our cash flows, Doug, I -- there's really no change in what we've been doing for a very long time, which is making sure we pay a consistent increasing dividend over time. We fund that very robust capital program that we have and get these projects -- as you know, we have very large projects starting up between now and the end of 2016, getting all that funded, as well as our pipeline of portfolio projects. And then the balance of the cash, we return to the shareholders via the buyback. In terms of target leverage or any of that sort of thing, I really wouldn't have a comment on that other than we do have an objective of maintaining a very strong balance sheet, keeping that flexibility to take advantage of opportunities. And so although there's wide variability in prices and margins as we go through the cycles in the business, those constants will remain just that. And we really don't -- really wouldn't have any change that I could foresee coming.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Ed Westlake with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "So I just was going to keep this on the actual earnings, but one question for 2013. Obviously, you've made some small acquisitions, you've Denbury and obviously Celtic. If you can just run us through what volumes you expect in '13 and when you expect, I think, the Celtic deal to close.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes. Let me hit the second one first, and then I'll come back to the other one. I really wouldn't give any outlook comments on Celtic. That transaction has not closed yet. We're still in the review process. So making any comment about that probably would not be appropriate. If we go back to the Denbury deal that we did close in the fourth quarter, we did pick up, as I mentioned, a couple of hundred thousand acres there. I don't have an outlook for you, but in terms of what we'll do as we go forward, I can tell you that we did see in our own business in the Bakken gross operating production of about 33,000 barrels a day this year, and that was up just over 50% from last year, and that excludes a little bit of a contribution from the Denbury acquisition there at the end of the year. I will say that this acreage that we're picking up is in the high-performing middle Bakken and upper Three Forks area. It's also pretty adjacent to the properties we already had, so we get some good synergy and leverage there. So without giving a specific outlook on the volumes from that, we are certainly looking forward to folding that into our portfolio, optimizing the production out of that and really putting together, as we always do, a long-term forward plan for developing that resource. So we're pretty excited about it, but we just got it and we're just getting to work on it.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just in the quarter you had, I mean, European gas, I mean is it -- was demand weak or was it declined? And then on Africa, you fell a bit in Q4 versus Q3, and I'm just wondering, was that anything unusual?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes. If you look at -- so let's take Europe first. It's really decline, just normal decline, nothing out of the ordinary there. We did see -- we also had a little bit of -- if you're looking, say, year-over-year, particularly in the fourth quarter, we did have some asset management impacts as well. So think about it as a little uptick in demand, offset by normal decline and the impact of the assets that we divested.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And then Africa oil fell Q-over-Q and obviously, year-over-year?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes. If I'm looking at the Africa liquids, I think we're actually up a little bit in the fourth quarter of '12 versus '11. But sequentially, yes. We began -- yes, if you're looking sequentially, that's really just a planned downtime event. We actually had a little increase in pricing spend, entitlement impacts, but it was really maintenance and downtime.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Robert Kessler with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.", "Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "If I could just follow up on the European gas volume comment, even if I adjust for the portfolio effects, I estimate you're still down maybe 5% year-on-year and I'm wondering what -- one, is that a good adjusted number, where would you point me there? And then secondly, how much of the decline might you attribute to loss with increased competition, with say, coal imports into Europe, which appear to have been quite robust kind of midyear into year end? And then how much of that might reverse in the first quarter would you estimate?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes. Let's take those -- probably best to look at that on a full year over full year. Although the quarter, I think, could be -- would be pretty similar. If we look year-over-year in total, we did see a little uptick in demand on a net basis, and we actually had a little better performance in our operations from a downtime perspective. So that was offset, if you look at the total year-over-year demand, really, by decline and asset management impacts. In terms of competition from coal or that sort of thing, I don't think that's a big impact. I know there's been some switching around up there, but I think for our perspective, overall -- again, our demand was a little higher, we're just seeing the impact of normal decline in the asset management from the assets we divested, primarily in the fourth quarter of last year.", "Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then on the Downstream, it sounds like you referenced a better capture on the light end of the barrel feeding into your refineries. Can you give us some more color around that? Are you running more light crude oil in North America as a percentage of the overall feedstock? And are you getting a better price relative to benchmarks in the applicable regions, let's say, LOS [ph] along the Gulf Coast, and any kind of incremental color in terms of earnings contribution on the margin or extra volumes you're running?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, sure. Let me give you just a little bit of data coming right out of the earnings, Rex [ph], that we talked about. If you look at our fourth quarter '12 over fourth quarter '11 earnings, there's a volume mix effect there that nets to $80 million. I can tell you within that is about $300 million positive on our optimization of our refining circuit. And a big piece of that is going to be higher advantage crude processing, both heavy crudes into a number of our refineries as well as an increased light feed slate along the Gulf Coast. Now that was offset by a number of things, including assets that we no longer own. But likewise, even if you look on the sequential earnings, where you see that volume mix effect of a positive $260 million, embedded in that is about $400 million of total refining optimization effects, also including the slate that we're running in, particularly in the light feeds as well as getting some more of the heavy feeds in. So without being real specific in terms of numbers, we are benefiting greatly. And it's not just -- I think one thing that we ought to be clear on understanding is it's not just the optimization of the feed slate into the refineries to produce clean products, it's also the benefit we get from the integration with chemicals and lube, so we're optimizing the products that come out as well across a broader slate. So when we're looking at optimizing the total circuit, it's across all of the business units. And that's where we probably get an advantage that others who don't have this level of integration, just aren't able to get. And so some of that shows up in the other places as well. I can give you one just number that'd probably help a little bit. As we look at just our U.S. Gulf Coast refining circuit, we have more than triple the processing of advantaged North American crude over the last couple of years. So again, without giving a KBD or a percentage basis, you can get a feel for the kind of impact that we're having.", "Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division", "I appreciate the ratio at least. Now that you've tripled and we're set to get a bunch more pipe to come online to the coastal markets here in short order, can you give some order of magnitude of how much further you could go as far as a ratio, again assuming the price would justify it in the linear programming model?", "David S. Rosenthal", "I wouldn't want to give a specific number there for commercial reasons, other than to say we are working on that and tweaking things a little bit so that we can continue to pursue the opportunities to do that and get a little more flexibility. One of the things I'll mention, another statistic that I think folks lose sight of a little bit just because of our size is when you look at our 5, what we call, Mid-Continent refineries, so you're talking about the Rockies and then up into Canada, we've got about 600,000 barrels a day of \"Mid-Con,\" if you will, refining capacity. And while that's not a big percentage of our total worldwide capacity, when you look at it compared to others in the industry in the U.S., it is a sizable component of our capacity. So again, if you're thinking about heavy feeds in the refineries, if you're looking at light feeds into the circuit from the Gulf Coast all the way up into Canada, we are optimizing that entire circuit. And again, that's across refining chemicals and lubes, and you're seeing that in our margins both in the Chemical business and in the Refining business.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Jason Gammel of Macquarie.", "Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research", "David, I was hoping that I might be able to get some more granularity on the comment on Slide 12 that talks about the active exploration program in the Gulf of Mexico in 2013, either in terms of number of rigs employed, number of wells planned or better yet, specific prospects you're planning to drill. And then if you could provide similar information on the global deepwater program.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure. Let's start with the Gulf of Mexico, and it's really a number of things from drilling wells to processing seismic to capturing additional opportunity. I could give you a couple of well examples. The Phobos well has spud. We're participating in the Thorn well next. So a couple of wells there. We're also -- as you know, we have a very large portfolio and we're running a lot of seismic activity both on the imaging side as well as the processing and analysis, so a lot going on. I think, in terms of the specifics and kind of some of the numbers, I'll hold off and we'll discuss that in our Analyst Meeting and give you a little more granularity and coverage on that. If you look globally, we've got a number of things going on, building on success from last year. As you know, we had the discoveries in Tanzania, very successful there, and a lot more work going on there. We also -- we followed up on the success we had in Romania, in the northern Black Sea as an example. So it's really a nice pipeline. We're doing appraisal and work on Hadrian and looking at the project there, so that's kind of at the front end of the curve. Some other wells going down, building on some successes and then the pipeline of opportunities coming in, a couple of those I mentioned in my remarks. So we do intend to give you a really good fulsome update on our deepwater program in the Analyst Meeting, and so I probably don't want to get too far out ahead of that. In addition, and I think equally exciting is, we have a number of unconventional wells that are liquids-oriented that we'll be doing this year. Of course, I mentioned Western Siberia with Rosneft. We have a lot of activity going on in Colombia, continuing to work in Argentina. So probably as balanced a portfolio as we've had in a long time as we head into 2013. And again, building on last year's success and starting to drill a lot of these opportunities that we've acquired over the last few years.", "Jason Gammel - Macquarie Research", "Okay, that helps, and I look forward to the Analyst Meeting. As my second question, David, this is probably going to be fruitless, but you do reference on Slide 20 that Iraq spend had negative effects on the 2012 production volumes relative to the outlook. If that Iraq spend number went to 0, would you be able to provide what type of impact it would have on your production guidance?", "David S. Rosenthal", "No, I really don't have that number and wouldn't want to speculate on that. I think if you look at what we were able to do in this past year in Iraq, it's really meet our commitments, get the production up, spend a lot less money, all of that's good. It just -- as you know how the contracts work there, that meant that we got fewer barrels, but I wouldn't want to speculate on what a number might be if the spend went to 0.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Doug Terreson with ISI.", "Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "I have a question about the Downstream. Your OECD product sales posted a positive comparison for the first time in a while, meaning North America and Europe, Canada. So my question is whether or not you guys are seeing better trends in some of these developed countries or whether company-specific factors might be driving the improved results, specifically a minute ago, you mentioned that you're running a lot more North American crudes and yields might be better. But anyway, I just wanted to see if you could try and reconcile that.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure. Let me start with the U.S. because that's probably the best indicator of what we're seeing. You do see a bit more of, I mentioned, the optimization that we're getting out of running some of the feeds, but I think the biggest part and the one that we're really pleased with is we're seeing some good business growth out of our new model and our new footprint. We've been spending the last few years transitioning from a company-owned retail market -- or a retail business rather -- into a dealer and distributor market. And so you might think we'll -- we'd lose all those volumes. But what we've seen, in fact, is we've kept a lot of those volumes and then the B2B business has picked up for us. So again, we're pleased with the ability. Again, it all gets back to this integrated business model and integrated business teams looking at the new footprint that we have on the retail side and finding ways to profitably move the barrels into the market that we used to run through our own and operated stores. So that's really the big driver there.", "Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And also you mentioned in the presentation just a few minutes ago, 2 of the more high potential, unconventional oil development areas, which being Argentina and Russia, and so I wanted to see if you could provide a little bit more specificity on what Exxon plans to accomplish in the joint venture with Rosneft and also in Argentina in 2013, meaning, given the pace of activity that you highlighted, it seems like you may be able to frame an outlook in Argentina sooner. But just wanted to see if you had more specifics on the next steps in those 2 countries this year.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure. Let me start with Russia and then back up into Argentina. So if you're looking at Western Siberia, in particular, in that unconventional area, the plan for 2013 is really to take this agreement that we've signed and really start looking at testing, analyzing what's there. And of course, on all these unconventional plays, it's not a question of is there something down there, it's a question of can you make it commercial. And you've seen around the world, some of these have been commercial early and some have not been commercial. So the most important first step in Western Siberia tight oil is to see what's there, apply some technology and see if that's going to be commercial. And that's what we'll be doing this year jointly with Rosneft. Of course, the great thing about Western Siberia is you have an opportunity to leverage the expertise we've developed and are applying here in the U.S. and we've applied elsewhere in other countries -- we're currently doing it in Argentina and Colombia -- and take that into Western Siberia, marry it up with Rosneft's operating capabilities and all of the assets that they have on the ground, and see if we can fairly quickly ascertain what's there in the commercial viability. I mentioned there's, I think, 10,000 square kilometers over 23 blocks. So defining where the best spots are quickly will also be very key so that we don't spend too much time and money drilling in areas that don't have the best prospectivity. It's still early days in Argentina. I mentioned that we do have these 4 wells down and we're very happy to have that and we're looking at those. We've got 800,000 acres down there and we know it spans all of the windows from dry gas to mixed gas and liquids to tight oil. And so the real objective of the exploration effort is to figure out what we've got, where it is, can it be commercially produced and then after that, how you might develop that resource and get those products to market. As we look into 2013 in Argentina, we're going to continue evaluating and testing the wells that we drilled and got down last year. I'll tell you that we have another well that was drilling at year end that we'll get done in the first quarter and get to work testing that this year. And then we have the 6-well, I mentioned, that spud in December. And then we've got 4 additional wells coming this year. So these will be our first operated wells in a number of areas. So when we get done this year, although we'll barely scratch the surface of 800,000 acres, we should have a pretty good idea of what we got with the way we've got these wells spread out.", "Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "David, you don't consider infrastructure constraints to be meaningful in either country where you guys are operating?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Not at this point in time. We've got plenty of assets on the ground that we're deploying, and so we don't see that as an issue, again, in this exploration and evaluation and assessment phase that we're in.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Iain Reid with Jefferies.", "Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Going back on production, just looking at it from a high level, you're talking about falling about 6% year-on-year, but gas is down substantially more than that, particularly in Asia. You've talked about European issues, but also in the U.S. So it seems to me that globally, your gas volumes are declining well, about faster than I think was generally expected a year ago at the Analyst Meeting. Do you want to make a kind of general comment on that? Obviously, Exxon is very positive on gas in terms of demand going forward, so it seems strange in a way. I can understand the U.S. situation, but outside of the U.S., it seems strange unless there's some operational issue why gas is falling really so far. And it kind of makes you wonder about whether the rebound which you were forecasting last year, and overall production of 1% to 2% from 2012, is likely under this sort of progression we're seeing.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, that's -- let me kind of look at that on a full year basis. As you mentioned, gas in total year-on-year is down about 6%. If you look across the regions, I mentioned Europe already, and that was a chunk of that. One of the big factors is what I mentioned in the last quarter, we became cost current in our AKG project in Qatar, and you might recall that's a flowing gas project into Qatar as opposed to going into LNG. And that's the biggest driver. If you look at our Asia gas production, down about 500 a day or 10% year-on-year. There's a few things in there, but a big chunk of that is going to be the AKG project. Now if you look across some of the other ones, we did see, for example, in Australia, some lower demand this year across that was weather-related. And then if you look at the declines in North America, the U.S. down just a little bit. We have, as I've talked about over the year, had a fairly significant shift of our rig count away from the dry gas areas into the liquids-rich areas, in the places like the Bakken, in the Permian, in the Ardmore and away from some of the dry gas areas. And so you're certainly seeing that impact there as well. Canada, just there we had the asset sales you might recall, a year ago, and so we saw some of that. We got good value from that property and just normal decline. So if I look across all of the regions, there is nothing there that's unexpected. The only thing that happened a little quicker than we were expecting was the cost currency in AKG. We will be providing a fulsome update on our production outlook at our March Analyst Meeting, both on the liquids and the gas side. But I will say, just to kind of finish it up, if I look at expectations and performance, decline came in this year right about what we were expecting. Of course, we knew what the impacts of the asset sales would be and the cost currency on AKG, so from that standpoint and operationally, overall, downtime was a little better, performance improved there. So I wouldn't looked at the year-to-year change as anything to be concerned about or that we weren't able to do what we had planned to do. But again, in terms of going forward, we're certainly looking forward to visiting with you all in March and giving you a fulsome outlook on that.", "Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, David. Could I tempt you on a question on the reserve outturn for 2012 or you going to hold that one over until you report that?", "David S. Rosenthal", "We'll hold that for a couple of weeks. We're going to do our normal mid-February report out on how the reserves and resource space is looking. And so if you'll bear with us for a couple weeks, we'll get that out about mid-February.", "Iain Reid - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, last one then. If I look at CapEx, which obviously is higher than you outlined a year ago, can you just strip out the acquisitions you've made, so to tell us what the kind of organic CapEx is?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, that's -- let me take the opportunity to update on that because I think we had talked about $37 billion at the Analyst Meeting, and we said that did not include acquisitions. And so we had about $3 billion worth of acquisitions across the year. So if you take the $3 billion out of the $40 billion that we actually reported, we'd be pretty much spot on the outlook that we gave you in March.", "Operator", "We'll take our last question from Paul Cheng of Barclays.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Two quick ones. David, in your presentation, on Page 16, you indicate that the $1.2 billion is the asset sales gain and the favorable tax primarily. Do you have an actual absolute number for the tax benefit in the quarter?", "David S. Rosenthal", "This was the -- which...", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Page 16 on the Upstream.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Oh, okay. That's on the sequential.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Right. So I mean do you have an absolute number, not sequential change, but the absolute number of the tax benefit in the quarter?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure. The absolute -- oh, let me see, I have a -- I don't have an absolute number. I can tell you what the change is sequentially, it's about $700 million of the $1.2 billion.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "That's the sequential change.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "If after the call you have that number and will be willing to share, if you don't mind to have someone just send me an e-mail.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Okay.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And secondly in Kearl, if we look at the actual cause for Phase 1 now is $12.9 billion. Last year, I think revised up to $10.9 billion and original budget was $8 billion, so this is somewhat uncharacteristic of Exxon given the cost of a run. And with that only about a year and you'd gone up from $10.9 billion to $12.9 billion, should we be concerned about the Phase 2, the current $8.9 billion that is going to be significantly higher?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, Paul, let me -- let's talk a little bit. As you recall, between the very first estimate and the $10.9 billion that we gave, we reconfigured the project and put it into the initial production project and the expansion project and talked about the bottlenecks would come down, and that was one of the big factors in that. Of course, ForEx has played a factor in the overall project, et cetera. I think one of the things that's real important to keep a focus on is if you look at the total bitumen expected to recover by the first phase in the expansion phase, about 3.2 billion barrels of bitumen, the all-in cost for that, including this recent update that we gave on the dollar cost, is about $6.80 a barrel, total, all-in, and that compares to the $6.20 that we had given before. So we're up about 10% on a unit cost basis, as we work through both the initial project and the expansion. So while that is an increase, we're feeling pretty good about it given a lot of the challenges that we had to deal with in terms of transportation of the modules and the weather and that sort of thing. If we look specifically at the expansion project, where we have given an estimate on -- of $8.9 billion, and of course, that's a lot less than the first one because of all the infrastructure, the tailings dam and all that sort of thing that's already in there. The good news on that project is it's actually a little ahead of schedule as we're sitting here today. It's about 27% complete and moving right along and really, really starting to see the advantage of the ability to basically carry over all of the engineering work that was done on the first phase, building the second train right behind the first one, applying the learnings in kind of a real-time basis. So I don't have another cost outlook for you other than the $8.9 billion, but when you look at the schedule that we're on and the progress we're making, that project is coming along real good. And again, when you look at those 2 projects together, we feel real good about the competitiveness of that project going forward in this space. And then again, as the years go by, we'll look forward to the bottlenecking and getting up to that full 345,000 barrels a day we've talked about before. So...", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And can I just maybe sneak in, on the shale oil, do you have a rough estimate, the number of rig that you're going to use in the U.S. for the shale oil's development? Is that going to be higher, about the same or lower than last year?", "David S. Rosenthal", "I think on average, you'll see that because of the big trend we made across last year where we kind of went from notionally 45%-or-so of the rigs as we came into the year doing dry gas, and now we're down to about 1/3 on the gas side, 2/3 on the liquids. So as you balance that out across the full year, you would, of course, see on average, year-to-year, more rigs associated with the liquids. We continue to optimize the whole rig fleet. But in terms of what the total rig count would be, that would be hard to say right now because, again, we've just gotten the Denbury deal done and we're looking at that and thinking about what we want to do and looking at some of the other aspects of our unconventional liquids program in North America. But we will be actively pursuing those resources and working hard on the development, but I just can't give you a specific rig count just yet.", "Operator", "That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Rosenthal, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.", "David S. Rosenthal", "I'd just like to thank everybody for your participation on the call today and all of your questions. And I -- we certainly are looking forward to our meeting in March and having the opportunity to talk more about our results and our plans for the future. And so we'll see you then. Thank you, all, very much.", "Operator", "That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

(Operator Instructions). Today\u2019s call is being recorded. And at this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning, and welcome to Exxon Mobil\u2019s second quarter earnings call and webcast. The focus of this call is Exxon Mobil\u2019s financial and operating results for the second quarter of 2013. I will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2.", "Moving to Slide 3, we provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global economic growth remained constrained in the second quarter. U.S. economy continues to be sluggish after first quarter GDP growth was revised downward. ", "China\u2019s economic growth continues to lag expectations while European economies remain weak. Energy markets delivered mixed result in the second quarter. The quarterly average crude oil price declined more $10 barrels per barrel from the first quarter. Narrowing the spread with WTI. While U.S. natural gas prices increased.", "Global industry refining margins were essentially flat with increases in the U.S. margins offset by weakness in Europe and Asia Pacific. Chemical commodity product margins declined across the quarter.", "Turning now to the second quarter financial results as shown on Slide 4, Exxon Mobil\u2019s second quarter 2013 earnings were $6.9 billion, a decrease of $9.1 billion from the second quarter of 2012. Mainly reflecting the absence of prior gains associated with the Japan restructuring and divestments.", "Earnings per share for $1.55. The corporation distributed $6.8 billion to shareholders in the second quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $4 billion was used to purchase shares. CapEx in the second quarter was 10.29 billion and 22 billion for the first six months of 2013 in line with anticipated spending plans.", "Cash flows from operations and asset sales was $8 billion. At the end of the second quarter cash totaled 5 billion and debt was $19.4 billion. The next slide provide additional detail on second quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter cash decreased from $6.6 billion to 5 billion. Earnings, depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items including equity company dividend and our ongoing asset management program yielded $8 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales.", "Uses included addition to plant property in equipment of $8.7 billion and shareholder distribution of 6.8 billion. Additional financing and investing activities increased cash by $5.9 billion. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $3 billion in the third quarter. Moving on to slide six and the review of our segmented result. Exxon Mobil second quarter 2013 earnings of $6.9 billion decreased 9.1 billion from the second quarter of 2012 reflecting the absence of prior gains associated with the Japan restructuring and divestments.", "In the sequential quarter comparison shown on slide seven. Earnings decreased by about $2.6 billion across all segments. Guidance for corporate and financing expenses remained $500 million to $700 million.", "Turning now to the upstream, financial and operating results and stating on slide eight. Upstream earnings in the second quarter were $6.3 billion. Down $2.1 billion from the second quarter of 2012. Higher natural gas realization mainly in the U.S. partly offset by lower crude oil realization increased earnings by $90 million. Worldwide natural gas realizations increased a $1 per thousand cubic feet while crude oil realization declined $4 per barrel.", "Production volume and mix effects had a small negative impact of $70 million. All other items mainly the absence again on prior year asset sales and the reimbursement of past exploratory cost to Rosneft for the Back Sea and \u2013Sea joint ventures decreased earnings by about $2.1 billion.", "Upstream after tax earnings per barrel for the second quarter for 2013 were $17. Moving to slide nine, volumes declined by 78,000 oil equivalent barrels per day or 1.9% from the second quarter of last year. Liquids production was down 26,000 barrels per day as field declined and divestments were mostly offset by increased production from liquid rich place in the U.S. project ramp ups and lower down time.", "Natural gas production was down 307 cubic feet per day. As field decline mainly in the U.S. and lower entitlement volumes were partly offset by higher European demand lower downtime in several countries including Qatar and project ramp up. Note that entitlement impacts were all price and stand related. Turning now to the sequential comparison and starting on slide ten. Upstream earnings decreased by $722 million versus the first quarter of 2013.", "Realizations reduced earnings by about $360 million as worldwide crude oil and natural gas realizations decreased by $5.84 per barrel and $0.56 per 1,000 cubic feet respectively. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by about $300 million mainly due to lower European seasonal gas demand. Other items had a small net negative impact of about $70 million as the higher cost in Russia, mentioned in the quarter-on-quarter comparison were mostly offset by several small positive items.", "Moving on to slide 11. Oil equivalent volumes were down about 7% sequentially. Liquids production was essentially flat, compared to the first quarter. Higher plant down time and field decline were mostly offset by improved reliability and project ramp-ups. Natural gas production was down 1.8 million cubic feet per day versus the last quarter, mainly due to lower seasonal demand in Europe. Our year-to-date volume performance is in in line with the projection presented at the analyst meeting in March with strong uptime performance, increased North America unconventional liquids production and higher European gas demand offsetting this lower than anticipated ramp-up at Pearl. We remain on target to meet the 2013 volume outlook presented at the analyst meeting.", "Moving now to the downstream financial and operating results and starting on slide 12. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $396 million, down $6.3 billion from the second quarter of 2012, due primarily to the absence of the $5.3 billion gain associated with the Japan restructuring. In addition lower refining margins reduced earnings by $510 million. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by 370 million, reflecting significant planned refinery maintenance activity across all regions.", "Turning to slide 13, sequentially second quarter downstream earnings declined by almost $1.2 billion. Lower overall refining margins, including unfavorable price timing effects in the U.S. decreased earnings by $170 million. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by 540 million, reflecting significant planned refinery maintenance activity at Juliette and Torrance in the U.S. and Strathcona, Saudi Arabia, Augusta and Singapore outside the U.S. This was the highest quarterly planned maintenance activity over the past five years. Other items reduced our earnings by $440 million primarily due to the absence of first quarter asset sale gains and costs associated with the Dartmouth Refinery conversion.", "Moving now to the chemical, financial and operating results, starting on slide 14; second quarter chemical earnings were $756 million, down $693 million versus the second quarter of 2012. Lower specialty product margins reduced earnings by $100 million. Higher commodity product volumes driven by strong polyethylene demand increased earnings by $120 million. The absence of the gain associated with the Japan restructuring decreased earnings by $630 million while all other items decreased earnings an additional $80 million.", "Moving to slide 15, sequentially second quarter chemical earnings decreased by $381 million. Lower margins mainly due to weaker aromatics prices reduced earnings by $200 million while an improved sales mix provided a $30 million offset. Higher plant maintenance expenses associated with Singapore\u2019s new steam cracker start up and the absence of gains from prior quarter asset sale decreased earnings by 210 million.", "Moving next to the second quarter business highlights beginning on slide 16. We continue to advance our portfolio of high quality upstream projects which we expect will deliver the liquids growth presented at the analyst meeting in March. The Kearl oil sands development continues to produce pipeline quality crude. We continue to ramp up production, having now run two of the three froth treatment trains individually as well as concurrently and achieved rates of 35,000 barrels per day through each. The third train is ready for initial operation and its startup will enable production to increase 110,000 barrels per day in the coming months.", "The Kearl expansion project is on budget, ahead of plan and now over 40% complete. We are using existing Kearl initial development contractors for efficiency and continuity and achieving higher productivity as a result. The expansion project is scheduled for start-up in 2015. The Julia initial development project was sanctioned during the second quarter and is expected to develop more than 190 million gross barrels of oil with start-up in 2016. The initial development phase is being designed for daily production of 34,000 gross barrels of oil and includes six wells with subsea type tie-backs to the Jack and St. Malo production facility. Front-end engineering design has been completed and the engineering, procurement, and construction contracts has been awarded. The field is estimated to have nearly 6 billion barrels of resource in place.", "Hebron construction activities continue with commencement of concrete ports for the gravity-based structure as well as fabrication of living quarters and drilling support module. Oil recovery from the project is estimated at 700 million gross barrels with upside potential. The platform is designed for production of 150,000 barrels of oil per day. First oil is anticipated around the end of 2017.", "Turning now to slide 17 and an update on our efforts to progress global LNG projects and opportunities. The map to the left of the chart provides an overview of our LNG business, displaying gross existing production capacity of 64 MTA. The site\u2019s currently under construction and a number of future opportunities being evaluated. The PNG LNG project construction is currently 88% complete and is achieving project milestones towards a 2014 startup.", "Commissioning activities for the first train at the LNG plant are ongoing while construction activities for the second train continue. Progress also continues at the Hides gas conditioning plant for equipment including gas turbine generators and utility systems that\u2019s being received and installed. We are also advancing expansion opportunities, including negotiations with NOL Corporation and Pacific LNG on the future development of the Elk, Antelope resource. Major terms have already been agreed and should negotiations successfully conclude Exxon Mobil is proposing that 4.6 TCF of the gas resource from the Elk Antelope field be used to underpin the construction of an additional train at the PNG LNG project site, subject to partner and government agreement. Construction at Gorgon is now 65% complete. Installation of the first subsea trees at [Jens] has commenced and offshore pipeline installation is ongoing.", "Moving now to North America, Golden Pass Products, our venture with Qatar Petroleum International recently initiated the FERC pre-filing process setting the stage for essential permitting activity associated with the design, environment and construction of a proposed project to produce and export up to 15.6 MTA of LNG. Golden Pass Products already has an export for free trade agreement countries and awaits approval of its non-free trade agreement license from the Department of Energy.", "Exxon Mobil and Qatar Petroleum International also signed a commercial framework agreement in the second quarter which demonstrate the project\u2019s readiness to succeed based on its technical, financial and marketing capabilities.", "In Western Canada Exxon Mobil and Imperial Oil recently filed an application with the National Energy Board for LNG export license to support the further assessment of the potential development of a natural gas liquefaction terminal on the Northwest of British Columbia. The export license requested is for up to 30 MTA for a period of 25 years. If developed the natural gas liquefaction plant LNG storage and marine loading facilities are anticipated to be in vicinity of either the [Kiddie map] or [Inaudible] areas.", "We also continue to assess other LNG opportunities in Alaska, Australia, Russia and Tanzania. A range of factors will be considered before any final investment decision is made, in particular the fiscal and regulatory regime market conditions and capital cost.", "Turning now to slide 18 and an update on our exploration activities. In June Rosneft and Exxon Mobil announced the completion of several milestones under the 2011 strategic corporation agreement, including joint venture formation for the Kara Sea and Black Sea projects. Collection of seismic data within both regions is underway and drilling operations are set to begin in 2014.", "As we announced previously Exxon Mobil and Rosneft agreed to increase the scope of their strategic cooperation by adding seven new blocks in the Russian Artic spanning approximately 150 million acres. We have now entered into more definitive foundation agreements for joint ventures to explore within these areas.", "Foundation agreements are also now in place for our joint venture Tide Oil project in West Siberia where data gathering is underway in preparation for drilling. Rosneft holds a 51% interest and Exxon Mobil has a 49% interest in this project.", "Turning to Romania. Exxon Mobil and OMB Petron have successfully completed acquisition of the largest ever Black Sea 3D seismic survey on the Neptune D Block, covering more than 2,300 square miles. This survey will be used to continue the evaluation of the Domino Discovery as well as to evaluate additional exploration potential on the Block. In the Gulf of Mexico we recently spud the Maui deepwater prospect on Walker Ridge Block 282 after acquiring a 33% in the prospect during the first quarter.", "Turning now to slide 19 an update on our unconventional liquids activities. In the Bakken play our gross operated production recently hit its highest level ever surpassing 60,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. For the quarter the equivalent production increased by 74% over the prior year quarter. This strong growth reflects higher per well production rates due to optimized drilling and completion practices and the shift to more pad development. For example after writing 20% in 2012, peak 30 day flow rates had increased another 15% in 2013.", "We have also commenced evaluation of multiple ventures in the Three Forks Reservoir as part of a larger Bakken project involving XTO and our upstream research company. This initiative has a goal of increasing recovery, identifying further drilling and completion efficiencies and better defining resource size and distribution across our 580,000 net acres of leasehold.", "In June of 2013 we started operations at a new cryogenic gas processing plant in Southwestern Pennsylvania. Located in Butler County this 340 acre facility we\u2019ll recover marketable liquid from Marcellus gas production. Two gas compressor stations feed the facility which is designed to treat approximately 125 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. More than 45 wells are expected to be contributing to production process at the plant by year end.", "In our Appalachian operations we hold nearly 700,000 prospective net acres across the Marcellus and the Utica Shale plays. The liquids rich Woodford Ardmore shale in South Central Oklahoma remains our most attractive and active unconventional play with 12 operated rigs.", "During the quarter we closed on a small bolt-on acquisition adding to our core Ardmore area and increasing our total acreage position to more than 280,000 acres. In the quarter gross operated production reached 31,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, up 73% over the prior year quarter. As noted in our March analyst meeting we are expanding the play into the overlying Caney shale. In the second quarter three Caney wells were completed and brought online, as we continue to delineate the reservoir across our acreage.", "Additionally our first Caney well is being completed in the Marietta area Southwest of the Ardmore Basin where the initial Wordford well in April 2012 had a 30 day peak flow rate of just over 700 barrels per day of oil and 1.4 million cubic feet per day of natural gas.", "Turning now to the Downstream chemical highlights and starting on Slide 20. We recently announced expansions to increase Group two premium lube basestock production capacity at our Baytown and Singapore Refineries. These expansion projects build on Exxon Mobil\u2019s strong manufacturing base at these two world scale facilities. Exxon Mobil is the largest producer of basestock for use in lubricant manufacturing in the world and these projects will help us strengthen our position as one of the industry\u2019s leading global suppliers of high quality lube basestocks. These expansions will employ Exxon Mobil proprietary technologies and increase production capacity of high value premium lube base stocks by 30%. Both projects are expected to start-up by early 2015.", "Turning now to Slide 21 on the Singapore Chemical Plant Expansion Project, during the quarter Exxon Mobil Chemical began producing ethylene from the facility\u2019s second world scale steam cracker, more than doubling steam cracking capacity at the site and significantly increasing specialties capacity. We are now able to produce Exxon Mobil proprietary specialty elastomers and Metallocene based polyethylene in the Asia Pacific region.", "Integrated with the existing petrochemical plant and powered by a 375 megawatt co-generation plant the new steam cracker is among one of the most energy efficient in our portfolio. The Singapore Petrochemical Plant is well positioned to serve growth markets in Asia Pacific while leveraging our feedstock flexibility in dozens of new technologies. In conclusion, in the second quarter we earned $ 6.9 billion, generated 4 8 billion in cash flow, invested $10.2 billion in the business and distributed $6.8 billion to our shareholders.", "We maintain a long term perspective on our business with a relentless focus on operational excellence and disciplined investing through the business cycle. As discussed in the business highlights we continue to progress a unique set of profitable growth opportunities which position us well to deliver long term shareholder value. That concludes my prepared remarks and I will now be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator\u2019s instructions). And we will take the first question from Faisal Khan with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi", "If you could elaborate a little bit more on the refining downtime, I know you said that this is the most downtime you\u2019ve had in the last five years. But I looked at the last two quarters in a row, throughput has been relatively lower versus kind of 4Q last year and 3Q last year. Can you discuss kind of how these plants are coming back online and how it is going to trend for the rest of the year?", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah, if you look across the year, the first quarter also had a high turnaround work load, so if you look at how we are doing this year, the first quarter was high but the second quarter was even higher. And certainly if you look prior to this year, over the last five years, it was considerably higher than normal. In fact about 9% of our capacity was offline for plant maintenance in the quarter and we typically averaged about 4% to 5%.", "Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi", "Okay, and then going forward is this all these plants back up and running or are you still have a significant amount of downtime?", "David Rosenthal", "No, these activities is now behind us and by and large all those units are back on line and up and running. And the other thing I will mention, Faisal, is we have a long standing practice of implementing improvement projects, minor projects anytime we have these large facilities down for an extended time. And we are certainly taking advantage of that opportunity and we\u2019ve done a few things at each of the sites to further improve the advantages that they have. Julia would be an example in the Midcon where we have done a few things to help improve our distillate production there.", "So big downtime all of it planned, all of it coming back up. And we are looking forward to the third quarter and getting these things again back up and running and producing product.", "Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi", "Okay, then last question from me on U.S. upstream capital expenditure looks like it kicked up really significantly from the first quarter this year to about 2.6 billion. Can you tell what is going on in the U.S. CapEx and in the trend going forward are you ramping up your program in different areas or how is that progressing.", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah, we did see a little if you are looking at a quarter-over-quarter in the U.S. upstream CapEx was up a just a little bit. It wasn\u2019t anything in particular. I can point to. We are doing, we have added some rigs, drilling activity is a little higher and just a number of other spend across the business.", "Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi", "Okay, fair enough. I was looking from the first quarter to the second quarter it and looked like a big ramp up. Is that increased rig activity or is that \u2013 I thought you guys were cutting back on CapEx in North America, on the rig cap but that was one of the things that came out at the analyst meeting but maybe I am wrong?", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah I am sorry Faisal what you are looking sequentially we are up, we had a couple of minor XTO-based acquisitions. We added some more acreage in the Woodford that I mentioned and we had a couple of other items. Additionally drilling was up quarter-on-quarter sequentially by about $100 million. We did have also a net increase in rig activity by a couple of rigs. So it\u2019s continuing the program of ramping up the production capability of the liquids and also taking advantage occasionally when we have an opportunity to bolt on a nice piece of acreage that fits in one of our big areas.", "Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi", "It makes sense. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.", "David Rosenthal", "All right, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Ed Westwick with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Ed Westwick \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Actually a follow-on from Faisal\u2019s question. Good morning.", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning, Ed.", "Ed Westwick \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Just on the, back in refining and chemicals. Do you think third quarter will be sort of fully clear or will you be fully back up sort of in the fourth quarter?", "Ed Westwick \u2013 Credit Suisse", "We always have a little planned maintenance across the quarters and there will we some but if you look in across our major plans in the book of our maintenance and turnaround activity is behind us but we\u2019ll always have a little bit, but particularly if you are really looking at the second quarter heading into the third quarter and the fourth quarter this year yeah there will be a much lower rate of maintenance activity.", "Ed Westwick \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And you flagged Singapore startup cost, obviously a big plant. I mean any number that we could think about in terms of the sort of scale of that in the second quarter so that we can model it for the third quarter?", "David Rosenthal", "You know total OpEx in there was up a little bit. Singapore was an item but it\u2019s not real significant in terms of order magnitude. So as we continue to ramp up a little bit you will see a little more there but nothing I would really signal out as being material.", "Ed Westwick \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay then a general question on LNG. I mean obviously Canada is a big opportunity, Tanzania and the Golden Pass Exports, I mean do you think we\u2019ll be talking about that at the analyst day next year with some granularity or you think it\u2019s further off in the future?", "David Rosenthal", "I think as we typically do at the analyst meeting we\u2019ll provide an update on all of those opportunities as they progress and hopefully by the end we can give you little more granularity in terms of expectations. But a number of things to look at and work on in the meantime.", "I think the good news for us is we have a number of potentially attractive large scale opportunities out there and we are assessing all of them and we look forward to talking about it more in March and of course particularly here in the U.S. we are dependent on getting the permit for non-free trade agreement countries to progress that project. But in the meantime as I mentioned in my remarks we are working on other permits and by the time we get to March we hope to be able to give you a good update on that.", "Ed Westwick \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thanks very much guys.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll now go to Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil. Please go ahead.", "Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil", "Hi, good morning David. Actually I want to stick on the Canadian LNG. It sounds like obviously we will get some more detail down the road but I had a general question for you with regard to the resource potential that you have to feed the facility, do you feel that you have adequate resources to feed it or would you rely somewhat on third-party gas, just any color there?", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah I think in general you know we have the resources available to feed that that doesn\u2019t mean that we wouldn\u2019t bring in some other but if you look across our resource base in Canada in particular the acreage that we got with the Celtic acquisition you look at the Horn River a number of other properties we have out there, we are pretty well positioned just internally to support a major LNG facility. And that\u2019s why we are looking at it so hard but again it\u2019s one of many projects but I think we are in pretty good shape.", "Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil", "Okay, that\u2019s great. Thanks. My second question is really on U.S. natural gas. It seems like the decline has slowed a little bit from what we witnessed in previous quarters and I am just curious if that\u2019s a stabilization in activity levels or if some of the ramp-up you talked about with regard to Faisal\u2019s question it may be and if that was in the gas window?", "David Rosenthal", "Well we do have obviously more drilling in these liquids rich plays. There is some gas obviously that comes out for that and that gets produced. And what\u2019s you are generally seeing there is kind of the base decline rate that you have, particularly if you are looking sequentially across the quarters in the U.S. being offset by a little higher, higher production. So it\u2019s really just the continuation of the program that we had in place. It does tend to stabilize. One of the things that\u2019s interesting with some of these unconventional oils of these unconventional wells particularly on the gas side is you get all these tails that stack up and by and large that\u2019s mitigating impact by itself.", "But we are also seeing very strong performance. I mentioned the Marcellus in particular but also in the Haynesville. So we\u2019re tracking right along in general some of the things we talked about at the analyst meeting, in terms of well productivity, some of the benefits we\u2019re getting from advanced completion technologies. You really starting to see that come into effect and in particular also on the liquid side. Whereas we talked about before we spent a lot of time after the XTO acquisition getting the Denbury trade dong a lot of delineation, a lot of appraisal working with the research folks on trying and improve our technologies.", "And now you are starting to see kind of the fruit of those efforts as we ramp things up. More pad drilling et cetera. So we talked about it before and I know you\u2019ve been waiting to kind of see the results of Marietta at XTO capability, with Exxon Mobil\u2019s technology and research. And I think we\u2019re starting to see that come up and we look forward to continued production increases in those areas.", "Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil", "I appreciate the color, David thank you.", "David Rosenthal", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll now go to Robert Kessler with TPH.", "Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.", "Hi, David. Couple of questions if you don\u2019t mind just to quantify some of the variance figures. One thing the Rosneft on that reimbursement amount paid to Rosneft for past exploratory costs and then the other one just quantification of the unfavorable price earnings effects and the downstream. I think you said there was part of 170 million sequential margin variance. But if you could just specify each of those in absolute terms?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure I\u2019d be happy to. The Rosneft reimbursement of past costs was 220 million on an after tax basis. And if you look at the total price timing effects for the second quarter of 2013 they about 166 million in total, about 150 of that in the U.S. If you compare that to the first quarter we actually had a 32 positive. So if you are looking quarter-to-quarter sequentially in the U.S. that was about $183 million negative impact on a sequential basis.", "Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.", "Very helpful. Thank you.", "David Rosenthal", "All right, thank you.", "Operator", "Next is Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. Good morning, David.", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning, Doug.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "David when we [travelled] this year you talked about [Rex] having a laser focus on efficiency gains, cost improvements and so on. If you look at the capture rate on your upstream margin this quarter, it doesn\u2019t really seem to be a lot of movements. So I am wondering if you could share some of those initiatives on what our expectations should be coming out of that? And I got a follow up please.", "David Rosenthal", "Sure. I think what I said was a little more broadly we had a laser focus on unit profitability. As we talked about at the analyst meeting where we acknowledged the fall back we\u2019ve had in the upstream unit profitability, given the mix of our production since the XTO acquisition and just reinforcing that we are very aware of this. We\u2019re working on it. Some of the portfolio projects that are coming online and particularly the liquids project are coming to fruition. We\u2019ve talked about the mix impact we\u2019re going to have over the next two or three years as all those liquids and liquids-linked projects come on.", "So there is not a specific OpEx program or something like that it\u2019s top to bottom, it\u2019s production, it\u2019s margin capture, it\u2019s bringing the projects online see any improvement in the earnings but also I will say as we always have, continued focus on operational excellence and cost management. So that\u2019s ongoing. But it\u2019s not anyone particular program. I will say if you take out the Rosneft seismic reimbursement and look at some of our unconventional liquid increases sequentially across the quarter and how things are trending. I think you\u2019re going to see that upturn on a cost on a price constant basis here as we go forward.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you for that. My follow up I am afraid is the buybacks. I really just want to take frame this but oil prices were obviously lot stronger both domestically and internationally. You are targeting production goals with 90% weighted towards liquids and you had obviously a big one off working capital shift in the second quarter. So with that backdrop I know you don\u2019t like to talk about the longer term outlook for buybacks. But conceptually why would you be pulling back on your buyback program given that backdrop and what is your tolerance for net debt and the balance sheet and I\u2019ll leave it there?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure, let me add a little bit to your backdrop comments, because they are all quite valid to me. Let me add just a little of perspective on the buyback. If you look back over the past two years, so you look at 2011 and 2013 we bought back $20 billion in each of those two years in share buybacks. We also had over that, so $40 billion let\u2019s call it for the two years combined.", "Over that same time period we had about $20 billion in debt proceeds from asset sales, so about 10 a year. So if you put those two together and you think about it we bought back $20 billion a year. 10 of it sourced from our operating activities and 10 sourced from proceeds from asset sale. Then if you come into 2013 and look at the first half we bought about $9 billion of shares back, have less than a $1 billion in proceeds from asset sales. So on equivalent basis we\u2019ve already bought back a little over $8 billion in share buybacks, excluding the proceeds from asset sales.", "So if you look at it from that perspective the buyback actually remains quite strong. There is nothing magical about the $3 billion number for the third quarter other than we\u2019ve just take look at like we always do expect the cash flows for the quarter, our needs, cash requirements and that sort of thing. And just came up with the $3 billion number. We\u2019re also managing our capital structure this year and keeping that in line with our longer term objectives. But not any more complicated than that. Again I think sometimes people overlook the fact that asset management program that we had that last couple of years generated a significant amount of cash for us. And we returned all of that to the shareholder which I thought was very positive. So I hope that answers your question, if not I\u2019d be happy to talk about it in little more detail.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go now to Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Hi. Good morning, David. I\u2019ll look forward to the point assistants next time the call begins as well.", "David Rosenthal", "I\u2019ll look into that.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "My first question on PNG. I mean it\u2019s clearly a differentiated position for Exxon I know you discussed your negotiations required additional supply and you picked up some exploration acreage in the quarter. But could you discuss how additional expansion trend compared within your portfolio versus other projects that I know you have reviewed globally. And additionally with train one and two were I think in their five years from FID to expected first gas. I would presume expansion trains could be much faster than that.", "And based upon the availability of gas does Exxon envision replicating a (inaudible) style development here of a train per type of a concept. I have a follow-up.", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah, let me kind of start at the back of your question first. Clearly as would be true of your project once you\u2019ve got all the facilities in play the pipelines the capacity the trains the utilities all the common facilities any addition is typically going to be quicker and have quite attractive incremental economics. So I wouldn\u2019t want give a specific time frame on an additional train at Papua New Guinea beginning other than they say we have plenty of land space there, we have plenty of infrastructure.", "So we certainly have the ability to as rapidly as possible expand that facility over the course of the next few years and we do have a number of opportunities for gas we mentioned the [Interoil] discussions are going on we have had some success in exploration recently in Pingyang South and we have got some other exploration opportunities in the area. So we are optimistic on that.", "In terms of relative economics of Papua New Guinea versus other projects I wouldn\u2019t want to give any specific comparisons or numbers other than to say we do view that project as quite attractive for us and we certainly look forward to bringing forward some expansion opportunities and continuing to improve further on those economics.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Great that\u2019s helpful and my second question if I can follow up on the buyback I mean that\u2019s gone from five to four to three on a guidance basis with limited free cash flow in 3Q even if we see CapEx flat to down in 2014 we see some continued pressure on that buyback. So really the question is going to reiterate Doug\u2019s question would you consider using the balance sheet or larger than normal asset sales to support the buyback going forward which is also historically supported your very high returns.", "David Rosenthal", "One of the things to keep in mind as we go forward particularly as you look into 2014 and you get kind of the ramp up in production and particularly liquids production that we showed you in the analyst meeting, at current prices, you could certainly expect increased cash flow right from operations. So I think as that goes up and remember most of these assets, these projects that we are bringing online in the next few year have two things. One they are either oil-based or oil linked gas and they are no decline kind of projects.", "So the CapEx requirement on a maintenance basis will be much lower than your typical oil projects and in the free cash flow generation out of that and the earnings impact were basically 90% of that increment tied to liquids. So you have to keep that in mind. When you think about, I guess the other one was using the balance sheet to buy shares. We manage the balance sheet really around to the whole capital structure that we want to manage and you have seen some increase in our debt levels here over the year.", "You might recall back three years ago after the XTO merger we had about $19 billion of debt on the books. We paid, most of that off over the ensuing years, got rid of that high cost debt. We have replaced that with low cost commercial paper. So we do continue to manage the balance sheet, manage the capital structure of firm but also always maintaining that balance sheet flexibility that we have talked about.", "So I wouldn\u2019t make any specific guidance on use of leverage or the buyback going forward, other than to say we continue to focus on cash flow generation and returning as much of that cash flow back to the shareholders as possible in the form of both increasing dividends which we did again this year and the buybacks.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay that\u2019s helpful. And one last one if I could I missed it. On chemicals in the quarter were there any impacts of outages there particularly in the U.S. I think volumes were lower.", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah we did have some planned maintenance but it was kind of minimum in terms of the impact in the U.S. Yeah one of the things we did see in the U.S. that was helpful was some increased polyethylene demand and that kind of helped our mix but we did have some downtime in a couple of areas but nothing real significant.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Got it. Appreciate it.", "David Rosenthal", "Thank you.", "Operator", "John \u2013 with Society Generale is next.", "John Hurling \u2013 Societe Generale", "Yeah hi. Two quick ones Dave. With respect to the Bakken you said you were going to combine your [exploitation] as to XTO folks with your technical people should we expect to see more of an activity ramp given the potential of Three Folks in the Williston?", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah I think it would be logical to assume overtime as we continue to develop that resource, particularly taking this kind of full field development approach that you would see us ramp-up activity overtime. I have to say and I kind of alluded to it in my opening comments we are really pleased with the progress we are making in Bakken.", "Again it\u2019s pad drilling, it\u2019s optimized completions, it\u2019s change in the way some things are done, incorporating the learnings as we go along. One of the things we talked a little bit about is not yet in a hurry, you don\u2019t want to drill a bunch of wells and then look back over your shoulder and wish you hadn\u2019t done that quite yet because you have learned a bunch. So I think we have a pretty deliberate discipline pace of growth in both activity and production but the gains that we are seeing year-over-year, we would like to continue and do more and not yet too far out in front of that curve.", "John Hurling \u2013 Societe Generale", "Okay, thanks. Next one from me is on the Tidal Oil pilot project with Rosneft. How long we will be in the science phase, next or so?", "David Rosenthal", "I think with unconventional resources in general we are going to be in science phase for a while. You know I think if you look at the West Siberia area tremendous opportunity for that joint-venture with us and Rosneft. We are in the process right now of gathering data but testing will begin this year. So that activity will startup before the end of the year depending on how that goes. That will determine the pace heading into next year but as we have done in all the other conventional we will prudent making sure we know what we have testing the resource itself, the quality of what we find underground and then looking for that commerciality determination but the area has plenty of infrastructure, plenty of support so if we can make it work we will get after it pretty quick.", "John Hurling \u2013 Societe Generale", "Okay. Last one from me is Maui deepwater, can you give us any more information on that?", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah, Maui is drilling ahead. We have not reached the target depth yet so because of that you know I really wouldn\u2019t want to say much more. Obviously in the next quarter we will have more to say on that. But the drilling is going fine as expected and we look forward to providing a little more update next time.", "John Hurling \u2013 Societe Generale", "All right, thank you.", "David Rosenthal", "Hey, thank you Doug.", "Operator", "Next is Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Hi, good morning David.", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning, Paul.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "David with respect to [inaudible] on this net income to barrel marginal barrel profitability can we just \u2013 sorry to do this but can we go back to this Rosneft deal first. If I look at the earnings year-over-year the variance in the other category was 2.07 billion. I think you said it was 220 million of that was Rosneft, is that correct?", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah that\u2019s correct.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "What\u2019s the rest?", "David Rosenthal", "It\u2019s very simple. All of the rest is the absence of asset sales from last year. We sold our Block 31 in Angola, we booked some of the Japan in there, we have some other minor sales but that 2.1 billion it\u2019s 1.9 asset sales and 200 million for other reimbursement of past cost.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Got you. I mean I think generally speaking because we are as focused as Rex is on this issue it\u2019s the more detail we can get on this [sort of noise] the better that would explain why the sequential earnings were down only 70 million in other would include the 220 of Rosneft, right?", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah, that\u2019s correct.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "So then there is obviously you know whatever it is 100 or something offset positive.", "David Rosenthal", "Yes. Paul, it\u2019s a number of small items, nothing really big to point out but yeah I think the important thing there is just what you have noticed. It\u2019s pretty clean on the other where you down all the factors in particularly given that we had a negative 200 million in there for the Rosneft cost.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Yeah, understood. The proceeds from the after-sales you also mentioned that you made a couple of acquisitions. Can we get some more detail on what the scale although you got 3 million of proceeds? I guess the acquisitions were in CapEx, right?", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah the acquisitions are in CapEx. I think all in less than a $100 million. I mean it wasn\u2019t significant in the quarter. There were some small bolt-on.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "That was the acquisitions. What were the sales upstream? Sorry, I missed that. Excuse me.", "David Rosenthal", "The sales that we had, we had some minor ones in the upstream just some minor ones there.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "It was upstream.", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah, it was just a little bit of stuff there. Again net-net kind of there wasn\u2019t a big deal.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "And I think you quite deliberately reiterated your guidance as given at the analyst meetings for, I think it was for full year \u201812 is that what you referred to?", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah, I just wanted to reinforce two things for you, the volume outlook is unchanged and the CapEx outlook is also unchanged.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, great, I have got a kind of a detail one which is unfortunate but then if you could extend into the overall North America picture, can you update us on the status and future for the Pegasus pipeline and then can you also talk about how you are going to move crude out of Canada down into major refining centers on the Gulf Coast, thank you.", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah, let me hit the second one first. We have the ability if you are really referring to Kearl we have got the pipeline capacity in place for 10,000 barrels per day to move that either into the U.S., some of that into Julia and also into our other Canadian refineries. If you are looking in general Western Canada crude down into the west coast we have made some other arrangements to offset, what was coming down Pegasus. So that really hasn\u2019t had a big impact on us, on a net basis. If you look at the Pegasus pipeline incident, kind of broadly, I will tell you that the clean-up of that is going very well. We have removed all visible free standing oil from the environment. Many of the folks that were evacuated from their homes have completed re-entry process. So that\u2019s going well.", "In terms of starting up that pipeline, you know, I really couldn\u2019t give you an estimate on that or an outlook. We still got some more work to do to determine the details of the investigation around that incident and what caused it and that sort of thing. So until we have got that completely nailed down and can, you know, think about that over the rest of the line, I just can\u2019t give you any update when that is going to be back in service.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, so it is obviously now I think the interesting thing is, if I could say I believe it was built in 1940 that pipeline, right?", "David Rosenthal", "Yes, yes.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "David, I look forward to seeing you in September, thank you.", "David Rosenthal", "All right, thank you.", "Operator", "Next is Paul Cheng with Barclays.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays", "Hey, guys, good morning.", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning, Paul.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays", "Two questions, David. In the second quarter, is there any one-off or some more unusual tax adjustment or inventory gain on those in any of your division that we should be aware?", "David Rosenthal", "No, Paul this is actually a pretty clean quarter along those lines.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays", "Secondly, that Dave, I think you talked about the success story that you guys have in the Woodford and also in some of the unconventional play like Bakken. Can you give us a rough idea that how much is the total unconventional liquid production today that you are running at net to the company and also within that the percentage between the split oil, condensate and NGL?", "David Rosenthal", "Paul, I don\u2019t have the breakdown of unconventional liquids relative to conventional, certainly what we are seeing, if you look at how we are doing particularly sequentially in the U.S. where I think our liquid production are basically quarter over quarter our liquid production flat, what you are seeing is unconventional increase in liquid production is offsetting declines. And so you\u2019ve got you normal decline on the conventional being offset by the unconventional. But I don\u2019t have those two numbers.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays", "Is that something that you guys will be willing to share and we could take it offline now or you could have someone to shooting me an email.", "David Rosenthal", "I think those kind of details will probably hold for a broader update in our analysts meeting in March. I think the important thing for us is this ramp up that we are seeing and the year- over-year increase that I have mentioned in my prepared remarks and again in particular the ability to grow these volumes at a lower capital cost as time goes on and a lower OpEx but I do understand your question. And I would look for an opportunity down the road to be a little bit more specific on that.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays", "And on the unconventional liquid, are your guys operating cost per unit or per barrel are they higher or about the same or lower than your average portfolio in the U.S.?", "David Rosenthal", "I don\u2019t know that I have that specific number in terms of coming up with conventional average cost versus an unconventional. Again Paul I think the important thing for us is to continue to ramp down those Op costs ramp up the well productivity as we depend on those unconventional liquids to offset the decline in the conventional. So I don\u2019t have a split out in the cost for you along those lines but again as this portfolio goes forward you will see an increasing amount in unconventional liquids offsetting and then growing more than the decline on the unconventional. But we\u2019ll also look for opportunity at the next analyst meeting to talk about that a little more as these volumes come up.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll now go to Allen Good with Morningstar.", "Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar", "Good morning, David.", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning, Allen.", "Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar", "Just a follow up question on your commentary related to the asset sales reporting, share repurchases in the past. First of all if there any current marketing of assets now that will be significant to potentially support the repurchases later this year and next? And then secondly on that point when you evaluate aftersales or the future potential of assets do you expect the returns on those future of those assets in the future relative to what you could potentially get on returns on buying your own stock and the valuation of your own stock so as the repurchase of \u2013 or use of proceeds factors into whether you decide to sell an asset or not?", "David Rosenthal", "Let me answer that second one. First those are two completely separate decisions. The decision to sell assets is sometimes it\u2019s strategic, like our decision to get out of owned and operated retail stores in the U.S. which also ties into the other part of asset sales which is they are worth more to somebody than they are to us and so often times when we look at something that looks like a strategic benefit for us it turns out that it marries up quite with an economic advantage for someone else.", "When you look across our other assets either an upstream, downstream or chemicals it\u2019s a very simple analysis. What this things worth to us looking at both upside potential and downside potential and then how does that compare to the value, to a potential purchaser and when the latter is greater than the former generally speaking we\u2019ll conclude an asset sale and a lot of those sales are opportunistic, where people approach us asking to buy assets. So we don\u2019t have a program. We don\u2019t have a target or an objective where they come along and they are attractive we go ahead and do it.", "And that kind of leads into \u2013 I really can\u2019t comment on future sales because as I said so many of those come about because we get approached by people and don\u2019t have any way to look at that. But I will say we did see a very successful program over the last couple of years and again as I mentioned earlier that cash flowed directly to our shareholders. But what we might do next quarter, next quarter or next year I just, I don\u2019t know and couldn\u2019t comment on.", "Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar", "Okay. Thanks. And my second question relates to the factors that you outlined as far as [direction] relative to tracking of LNG project with respect to Australia and I understand you are going to pursue FLNG down there and the development of Scarborough. Is anything else beside that potential with respect to regulatory or capital cost in Australia that had may be abated in the past call six months to a year that made that project a bit more attractive than it maybe was a year or two ago relative to the rest of your portfolio?", "David Rosenthal", "We haven\u2019t seen a big change in terms of the cost structure. We are evaluating the potential of FLNG at the Scarborough prospect and those evaluations continue but again I would want a position that relative to any other project either already in the portfolio or one that we\u2019re looking at. Again it\u2019s nice to have the wide geographic flexibility we have and the opportunity set for LNG. So you got a lot of things in play as I mentioned fiscal term stability, capital cost in particular areas, infrastructure and that sort of thing, as well as the market of those things which serve.", "So as we bring along this portfolio and evaluate it we\u2019ll be looking at different technologies FLNG is an example of that. Also different sizes the facilities and different locations and that sort of things. So we\u2019ll continue to progress that but don\u2019t have an outlook for FID and cost or any of those or certainly not relative competitiveness.", "Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar", "Okay, thanks. And just one quick one. I am sorry if I missed it. But on Asian gas volumes in the quarter was there a reason whether it be PSC or turnaround effect for the decline that\u2019s sequentially there?", "David Rosenthal", "If you\u2019re looking sequentially we had some downtime was a big piece of that. And then there also some price and spend impact on entitlements in the gas area there. But nothing outside of that unknown there.", "Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar", "Thank you very much.", "David Rosenthal", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we go to Pablo Mockonoff with Raymond James.", "Pablo Mockonoff \u2013 Raymond James", "Thanks for taking my question. First just a quick one on PNG, LNG any sense of when you\u2019re looking to make a decision project extension on [inaudible]?", "David Rosenthal", "No, I really don\u2019t have an outlook on that. We\u2019re still in the commercial discussion on the potential for expansion. So until those concluded it would be difficult to give any forward guidance on timing after that. Other than we\u2019re working on it and if those negotiations are successfully concluded we\u2019ll be in a better position to talk about the going forward timeframe.", "Pablo Mockonoff \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay. And then segment from me we\u2019ve seen a number of large western players getting into the Vaca Muerta in Argentina in a pretty big way. Can we just get an update on where things stand with your JVs down there with I guess it\u2019s America\u2019s Petrogas.", "David Rosenthal", "Sure, I think as you\u2019re probably aware we\u2019ve got a huge position in the Vaca Muerta. We were kind of early mover into that area. We\u2019ve got a 11 blocks totaling over 800,000 net acres in the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin. And of course we\u2019re targeting the potential of the Vaca Muerta. We did have number of wells that we drilled last year and into this year. Some of those are on test. And others are being completed and we will be testing going forward. We do have a fairly active operated plan for the balance of this year and we\u2019ll get a few more wells down there over the course of the year.", "The real key there is to kind of figure out where the windows are for the liquid versus the gas figure out what you got how it looks and not drill more wells then you need to define that resource. So we\u2019re pleased. The early results are encouraging and we continue to progress and like I mentioned minute ago we\u2019re looking forward to drilling our operated wells the rest of this year and give you a little better update as we progress.", "Pablo Mockonoff \u2013 Raymond James", "Right, appreciate it very much.", "Operator", "We go now to Iain Reid with Jefferies.", "Iain Reid \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "Hi, David. How are you?", "David Rosenthal", "I am good Ian. How are you?", "Iain Reid \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "I am doing very well. Got a few things. Firstly on just coming back share buyback. Just wondering when you look at share buybacks and dividends. Do you kind of look at those together, because you\u2019re ramping down the share buyback at the same time you increased dividends payments fairly significantly. So do you look at that as kind of total shareholder return number? I know you\u2019re moving if you\u2019re like more towards dividends rather than share buybacks consciously or is it more about this disposal impact you were talking about earlier?", "David Rosenthal", "Let me talk about the dividends first. I think the most important thing to think about the dividend is we have a track record and certainly talked about on a go forward basis the objective of always growing that dividend overtime. The rate at which we\u2019ve grown that dividend over the last several years has varied a little bit although if you average it out over the last five or ten years it\u2019s been substantial. We did take a 20% hike in the dividend in 2012 and other 10% almost 11% this year. And I think as we talked about it in the analyst meeting that was to, in response to both desires of our shareholders and also to remain competitive in the marketplace.", "So if you just hold that aside on the dividend than you get to the buyback and the buyback is of course driven by cash flow that\u2019s available to give back to the shareholder. And buybacks give us great flexibility in terms of managing cash and capital structure. And so I wouldn\u2019t combine that with the dividend. They\u2019re separate and managed in that manner. I think as you look back over the last few years at the sheer level of total distributions to the shareholders they have been quite impressive and again we have grown the dividend to meet those needs and then the rest of the cash has gone back in the form of the buybacks.", "Iain Reid \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "Okay. second one is I was curious about this what you are talking about in terms of refining capacity being significantly down in the because if you look at it on a sequential basis it is down but not significantly compared to the first quarter. So is there anything else in these refining numbers which could explain the kind of really weak performance other than just the cost of what you are doing and also the downtime you are talking about?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure a big piece of the actually impact on earnings really comes from the fact that a lot of the refineries were down or some of our higher margin refineries for example our Julia refinery in the Midwest was down for two full months and that\u2019s without giving a specific number I can tell you that\u2019s a big chunk of what you are seeing in that earnings number. So it\u2019s not the just the amount of throughput or the amount of value that was lost but the mix of those refineries as well.", "Iain Reid \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "And last one just on tax rates if you don\u2019t mind, your tax rate kicked up fairly substantially in this quarter compared to second quarter of last year is that a purely mix effect or some of your competitors have being talking about the impact of the stronger dollar on deferred tax balances. So is this something we might see kind of maintain, at elevated rates if the dollar remain strong or is it something you would expect to reverse with refinery becoming little bit more profitable?", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah let me hit that, if you are looking for example the last year\u2019s second quarter and this year\u2019s second quarter the biggest impact of that there is the difference the tax rate on earnings and some of divestments and restructurings that we have. Aside from that if you are looking sequentially this year it is purely the mix effect where we are making our money upstream versus downstream U.S. non-U.S., so a geography there and you saw the results much different in terms of the downstream quarter-on-quarter.", "I don\u2019t think foreign exchange rates are having an effect on us and going forward I don\u2019t have a specific number for you but if you kind of look back over the last several quarters and take out the impact of the big restructuring divestment we have kind of been in that kind of mid to upper 40s range. And so again, I don\u2019t have a specific outlook for you but if you take away a couple of those anomalies that\u2019s kind of where we have been.", "Iain Reid \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "All right, David that\u2019s very kind. Thanks very much.", "David Rosenthal", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we will take our last question from Faisal Khan with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi", "Thanks David. Just have a follow up. Could you just [stress] how are you dealing with this [REMS] issue in the U.S. for refining and downstream where you guys fairly balanced or you do that more blending capacity that you gasoline production capacity and how retail and marketing sort of help mitigate some of that?", "David Rosenthal", "The answer to that is yes, we are a net purchaser of [REMS] but I will tell you we are pretty well balance we do generate the majority of our credit by blending our biofuels directly. So while it is an impact on us it\u2019s not real significant I think the more broader issue is that arena is really the RFS mandate and approaching hitting the blend wall next year from an industry perspective and it\u2019s not going to be matter of [REMS] pricing but just the fact that the [REMS] will be come in sufficient and compliance with the RFS mandate is just going to be infeasible.", "So [REMS] are an issue it\u2019s topic but the more broader issue going forward is going to be the RFS mandate heading into 2014.", "Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi", "Okay. So just a comparable I am looking at your results for the quarter I shouldn\u2019t see any sort of material impact from Faisal [REMS] in the quarter?", "David Rosenthal", "No not at all.", "Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi", "Okay great. Thanks.", "Operator", "And that does conclude our quarter and answer session for today I would like to turn it back to David Rosenthal for any additional or closing remarks.", "David Rosenthal", "Thank you. I just want to thank everybody for time and questions today. We appreciate you being with us on the call and look forward to visiting with you next quarter.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning and welcome to Exxon Mobil\u2019s first quarter earnings call and webcast. The focus of this call is Exxon Mobil\u2019s financial and operating results for the first quarter. I will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. Before we go further I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on slide two.", "Moving to slide 3, we provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global economic growth continued at a modest pace in the fourth quarter, with mixed performance across the regions. The U.S. economy grew moderately despite the adverse effects of severe winter weather conditions. China\u2019s growth rate has flattened while the economies of Europe and Japan improved modestly. Energy markets delivered mixed results. WTI prices increased narrowing the discount to Brent as the global marker decreased in the quarter. Western Canadian select prices increased significantly. North America natural gas prices were also significantly higher. Global industry refining margins were essentially flat while chemical commodity product margins were stronger during the quarter.", "Turning now to the financial results as shown on slide 4, ExxonMobil\u2019s first quarter earnings were $9.1 billion or $2.10 per share. The corporation distributed $5.7 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and our share repurchase program. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding were $3 billion in the quarter. CapEx was $8.4 billion. Cash flow from operation and asset sale was $16.2 billion including proceeds associated with asset sales of $1.1 billion. At the end of the quarter, cash totaled $5.8 billion and debt was $21.4 billion.", "The next slide provides additional detail on first quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter cash increased by $900 million from $4.9 billion to $5.8 billion. Earnings, depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program yielded $16.2 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included additions to property, plant and equipment of $7.3 billion and shareholder distributions of $5.7 billion. Additional financing and investing activities decreased cash by $2.3 billion including a reduction in debt of just over $1 billion. Yesterday the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.69 per share a 9.5% increase from last quarter. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $3 billion in the second quarter of 2014.", "Moving on to slide 6 and a review of our segmented results. ExxonMobil\u2019s first quarter earnings of $9.1 billion decreased by $400 million from the first quarter of 2013. Lower downstream chemical earnings as well as higher corporate and financing expenses were partly offset by higher upstream earnings.", "In the sequential quarter comparison shown on slide 7 earnings increased by $750 million as higher upstream and chemical earnings were partly offset by lower downstream earnings and higher corporate and financing expenses. Guidance for corporate and financing expenses remains at $500 million to $700 million per quarter.", "Turning now to the upstream financial and operating results and starting on slide 8. Upstream earnings in the first quarter were $7.8 billion, an increase of $746 million versus the first quarter of 2013. Realizations increased earnings by $410 million primarily driven by higher U.S natural gas realizations.", "On a worldwide basis natural gas realizations increased $0.31 per 1,000 cubic feet while crude oil realizations decreased by $4.09 per barrel. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by a net $20 million. This included a favorable liquids mix effect of about $300 million reflecting increased volumes in Canada, Russia and West Africa as well as the minimal financial impact related to the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry. A positive liquids effect was mostly offset by a lower natural gas volume primarily due to warmer weather in Europe. All other items increased earnings by $320 million mainly due to gains related asset sales.", "Moving to slide 9. Excluding the impact of the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry oil equivalent production decreased by 2.9% compared to the first quarter of last year. Liquids production was up 73,000 barrels per day, or 3.3%. As the ramp-up at Kearl and lower downtime in several countries more than offset price and spend impacts, divestments and decline. Natural gas production was down 1.2 billion cubic feet per day primarily due to lower weather related demand in Europe.", "Turning now to the sequential comparison starting on slide 10. Upstream earnings increased to $1 billion versus the fourth quarter. Realizations had a positive impact of $540 million as worldwide natural gas realizations increased $0.84 per thousand cubic feet and crude realizations were essentially flat. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $650 million, this included a substantial positive liquids mix effect associated with increased volumes in Qatar, Kearl and West Africa as well as a net over lift and including the minimal financial impact related to the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry. The positive volume earnings factor also reflects higher natural gas volumes in Qatar. All other items had a negative impact of $190 million. Lower gains related to asset management activities were partially offset by lower operating cost.", "Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel were $21.35 excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes. Unit profitability increased to $3.40 from the fourth quarter reflecting the benefits of our broad diverse portfolio including leverage to North American natural gas, our strong LNG portfolio and the strategic choices we have made on production volumes to improve unit profitability.", "Moving to slide 11, excluding the impact of Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry volumes were up 45,000 oil equivalent barrels per day or about 1% sequentially. Liquids production was up 23,000 barrels per day, or 1%. Lower downtime increased production from West Africa projects higher liquids volumes in Qatar and ramp-up at Kearl more than offset price and spend impacts, divestments and decline. Natural gas volumes were up 129 million cubic feet per day reflecting higher volumes in Qatar partly offset by lower production in the United States and Europe.", "Moving now to the downstream financial and operating results and starting on slide 12. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $813 million, down $732 million from the first quarter of 2013 mainly due to lower refining margins across all regions. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $80 million offset by other items for a net $70 million.", "Turning to slide 13, sequentially first quarter downstream earnings decreased by $103 million primarily due to unfavorable volume and mix effects reflecting higher U.S. refining maintenance activities.", "Moving now to the chemical financial and operating results starting on slide 14. First quarter chemical earnings were just over a $1 billion, down $90 million versus the prior year quarter mainly due to lower margins. Positive volume and mix effects were offset by other items.", "Moving to slide 15, sequentially chemical earnings increased by a $137 million, primarily due to higher commodity product margins and lower expenses.", "Moving next to the first quarter business highlights beginning on slide 16. As we discussed in our March Analyst Meeting we are starting up a number of major projects that will deliver profitable volume growth. Our world-class project execution capabilities are enabling significant progress on several of these projects.", "At PNG we continue to achieve milestones that will results in the first LNG cargo [to be unloaded] ahead of schedule. We have completed the onshore and offshore sections of the pipeline which transports natural gas from the Hides gas conditioning plant up in the mountains to the LNG plant near Port Moresby. The first LNG train is now operational and the second train is mechanically complete with final commissioning underway.", "Over recent weeks we started holding the first gas from Hides and in the past few days initiated LNG production. And we produced the first condensate and liquid recovered through the liquefaction process. We expect the first LNG cargo deliver in the coming weeks. These are exciting milestones for the PNG LNG project and a great achievement for our project partners, contractors and the people of Papua New Guinea.", "As we mentioned in our Analyst Meeting we had overcome a number of challenges during the construction phase such as very steep slopes, flooding and lack of infrastructure. Despite these challenges we are starting up several miles ahead of plan and delivering a project with one of the lowest cost per MTA relative to other LNG projects being built and in close proximity to the growing Asian market. This is also an excellent example of how ExxonMobil creates value through our leading project execution capabilities.", "In Malaysia we have started our production into the Damar gas field from the first two of a total 16 wells. The Damar field has a projected capacity of 200 million cubic feet of gas per day and follows the Telok gas development which began production in 2013. These projects provide additional gas supplies to help meet Malaysia\u2019s power and industrial needs, promote growth of the country\u2019s natural gas industry and drive profitable volume growth for Exxon Mobil.", "The Hibernia Southern expansion in Canada a project that will deliver a 170 million barrels of oil is progressing per plan and is now nearing completion. Installation of subsea infrastructure for the water injection facility has now been completed. Three of five platform production wells have been drilled and top side modifications to the Hibernia gravity based structure platform are 97% completed. Start-up is expected later this quarter.", "At our Arkutun-Dagi in Russia we are commissioning the last few top side system at the fabrication yard. The platform drilling rig will be tested over the coming weeks. Before the 42,000 tonne topside structure is loaded out later this summer. The topside will then be floated over the gravity based structure already installed offshore Sakhalin Island. Drilling will then start and first production is expected later this year.", "The Banyu Urip project in Indonesia is now 87% complete. The project will deliver 450 million barrels of oil through an onshore central processing facility with a 165,000 barrels per day of production capacity. Pipe rack construction is complete, equipment installation at the central processing facility is progressing and the onshore and offshore pipelines are installed. Conversion of the floating storage and offloading vessel is nearing completion with major equipment installed and commissioning ongoing. Two rigs are operational and the first 20 wells have been drilled. Start-up is expected around year end.", "The Kearl expansion project in Canada remains slightly ahead of plan and is now more than 80% complete. We continue to ramp-up production from the Kearl initial development with 66,000 barrels per day produced during the first quarter up from 47,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter of last year. Facility uptime performance is improving and we are achieving many days with production above 100,000 barrels per day.", "Turning now to slide 17, for an update on our North American activities. We continue our commitment to deliver profitable volume growth as underscored by our efforts to increase high margins liquids production in the Permian. We had eight operated rigs running in the Permian in the first quarter and recently picked up two more in early April to continue to ramp-up drilling activity. Our current net production in the Permian is over 90,000 oil equivalent barrels per day.", "Through an agreement with Endeavor Energy Resources, XTO will gain substantial operating equity in approximately 34,000 gross acres in the prolific liquids rich Wolfcamp formation. The presence of multiple stacked pay zones creates a potential for capital efficient horizontal development and the proximity to XTO\u2019s ongoing Wolfcamp operations will offer operating cost efficiencies.", "The agreement increases XTO\u2019s holdings in the Permian basin to just over 1.5 million net acres, enhancing the company\u2019s significant presence in one of the major growth areas for onshore liquids production in the United States. Also during the quarter we signed an agreement with American Energy-Utica or AEU that will enable XTO to optimize funding of development cost in the Utica. As part of the agreement XTO will continue to operate in a core area of approximately 55,000 net acres in this emerging play and AEU will fund near-term development cost to earn acreage. This transaction is an example of an innovative solution to develop our extensive natural gas resources in United States in a capital efficient manner.", "Turning now to slide 18 for an update on our exploration activities, we are currently drilling a number of wildcat prospects from our deep and diverse opportunity portfolio, primarily concentrated in established areas. Some of this activity, includes the deepwater prospects Mica Deep in the Gulf of Mexico and the Cominhos prospect in Angola Block 32. We also continue exploration drilling in the prolific Block 2 offshore Tanzania were somewhere between 17 and 20 TCF of gas in place has already been discovered. And a recent drill stem test on the Zafrani 2 well confirmed good reservoir quality and good connectivity in both of the reservoirs tested.", "Drilling operations are also currently underway on two blocks in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. Also preparations are underway for near-term drilling that includes the [Inaudible]prospect in the Kara Sea, the broad gaining prospect in the Faroe Islands, follow up drilling to the successful Domino well in the Romanian Black Sea, the [Inaudible]well in Gabon and additional drilling prospects in Tanzania.", "Turning now to slide 19 and an update on our chemical business. During the quarter we achieved notable investment milestones to grow high value product sales. For example we processed synthetic base stock investments to meet global demand growth for high performance lubricant applications. We commissioned a new 50,000 tons per year manufacturing facility in our Baytown, Texas complex and construction of our expansion project in Baton Rouge, Louisiana continued during the quarter with start-up anticipated late this year.", "Both projects leverage Exxon Mobil\u2019s technology leadership to meet the industry\u2019s growing demand for advanced synthetic basestocks and improved finished lubricant performance. We also recently improved a world scale grassroots specialty polymers project in Singapore to produce halobutyl rubber to support the growing tire market in the region. In premium resins for adhesive applications such as packaging, wood working and non-molding fabrics. The project builds on the feedstock advantage and integration benefits of the recent steam cracking expansion and will allow us to meet rapidly growing demand in Asia. Construction will begin this year and start-up is planned for 2017.", "In conclusion in the first quarter we earned $9.1 billion, increased upstream unit profitability to $21.35 per barrel, generated $16.2 billion in cash flow from operations and assets sales, invested $8.4 billion in the business and distributed $5.7 billion to our shareholders. ExxonMobil\u2019s strong financial and operating performance demonstrates progress in delivering profitable growth and achieving our business objectives outlined during our Analyst Meeting in March.", "We improved our production mix and increased upstream unit profitability. We are committed to maintaining our capital spending discipline and generating strong operating cash flow to deliver robust shareholder distributions and create long-term shareholder value. That concludes my prepared remarks and I would now be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you Mr. Rosenthal. The question and answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator Instructions). We request that you limit your number of questions to two so that as many may have the opportunity to participate as possible. (Operator Instructions). And your first question will come from Doug Terreson with ISI Group.", "Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group", "Good morning David.", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning Doug.", "Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group", "I have a couple of questions on international E&P. First both profitability end margins were very strong and pretty much it has been in several quarters even if you normalized for the exploration in Abu Dhabi. So my question is whether there is any additional color on the positive liquid mix effects that you talked about a minute ago and whether or not there were any positive effects on the gas side that might have contributed to that result?", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah sure, let me take a look at the upstream earnings, we can look quarter versus quarter where I mentioned although we had a net impact of only $20 million we did have a significant impact on liquids that was about $290 million and gas was a negative $270 million on that. When you look at the production in the first quarter we saw some nice increases in Canada, Southern Russia, West Africa much lower downtime little more in the North Sea and those were benefits to us.", "And the biggest decline in production was the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry which carried a little earnings effect. If you would look at that same effect sequentially where we noted we had $650 million volume mix impact, liquids was about $400 million of that and gas was about $250 million.", "Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group", "Okay.", "David Rosenthal", "So as we look at going from the fourth quarter to the first quarter similar on the liquid side we saw some increases in Qatar, increases in West Africa as well Canada with a ramp up of Kearl and then it offset with the decline in Abu Dhabi. On the gas side we also saw a nice positive mix effect volumes for example in Qatar were up and volumes in Europe which was mainly the lower margin volumes out of the Netherlands were down because of the lower demand due to the normal weather. So in both liquids and in gas sequentially we did see a nice uplift in earnings from the positive mix effect.", "Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group", "Okay. And so on your last comment about European natural gas most of that or all of that decline was related to weather is that the way to think about it?", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah. The way to think about is it was all demand driven due to weather with the bulk of it again coming out of the Netherlands where the margins are a little lower than they are than on the rest of our European sales.", "Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group", "Great. Thanks a lot David.", "David Rosenthal", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And from [Singular] Research we\u2019ll hear from Paul (Inaudible).", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi David.", "David Rosenthal", "Hey good morning Paul how are you?", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great. Thank you. David can I just ask you about your CapEx and your volumes in the former case there is an enormous step down in your CapEx almost 30% which takes you well below the run rate for the year that you indicated at the Analyst Meeting is around $40 billion. Is there a reason to believe that we\u2019re coming in lower on CapEx for the year or is this \u2013 Q1 with your catch up later and therefore you would stick with the 40 or could we see some downside to that?", "And if I could follow up on the volumes David the guidance at the Meeting has been flat to \u201814 over \u201813 aligned for all the adjustments that needed to be made, again your Q1 numbers are actually tracking below that. Can we expect a catch up back to flat later in the year. And final \u2013 final part if you could just address the cash account and where that sat within your volume forecast both for this year and longer-term? Thanks.", "David Rosenthal", "Okay, sure Paul. Let me hit CapEx first. Yeah we did come in at $8.4 billion that was down little over $3 billion from the first quarter last year. That was mainly due to the absence of the Celtic acquisition in Canada, so if you take that out from last year\u2019s results we\u2019d be pretty much flat maybe down just a little bit. As we look out across the year the first quarter is usually lower than the rest of the quarters, we tend to ramp up across the year with a little extra in the back half.", "So I would say as we look at where we are today and looking out over the rest of the year the number we gave you in the Analyst Meeting is probably still a good one. I don\u2019t have an update, you know what I will say though is when we look at the first quarter CapEx it came in just about right on what we had expected. So, so far this year things are going according to plan on CapEx. On the volumes guidance we said overall we will be flat at about 4.0 million oil equivalent barrels per day year-to-year ex-Abu Dhabi about a 2% increase in liquids, about a 2% decrease in gas.", "As we look at the first quarter and then across the rest of the year those numbers still look good to us. We have got some additional ramp up expected at Kearl across the year. We do expect some of these other projects I mentioned come on Papua New Guinea being one of those. So we look at the first quarter it looks real strong and certainly increases our \u2013 maintains our confidence in meeting that full year projection we shared with you in the Analyst Meeting. I think the other thing that\u2019s noteworthy when I talked about a little bit on the last question is we are seeing the impacts we are expecting on the volume mix as we reduced our exposure to some lower margin barrels and we are able to increase production in some of our higher margin areas both on the liquids and gas side.", "And so that\u2019s kind of coming in as we are expecting and we talked about a little bit at the Analyst Meeting. In terms of Kashagan in the forecast for \u201814 we did not have any volumes in our outlook that we showed you in March for Kashagan for 2014.", "Unidentified Analyst", "That\u2019s very helpful, David and then a quick follow-up. Your product sales were up 11% year-over-year quarter-to-quarter in the past \u2013 recent past there has been a number heavily affected by asset mix. Could you just address the scale of that jump I mean 11% growth obviously on a company of your size looks like enormously strong oil demand globally, any thoughts? Thanks", "David Rosenthal", "Well. Let me just clarify the question are you saying product sales or are you talking about our downstream sales or?", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yeah, I should say to use your language exactly the petroleum product sales, if I look worldwide they are up 5.8 million barrels a day up from a year ago level of 5.7?", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah, we are up a little bit we have seen worldwide, we actually had some higher demand in the US actually some pretty good demand growth there. We have seen some growth in diesel as well with exports and actually some growth in Europe. So those are the two main areas but a nice quarter for us operationally as well.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Well I guess my question was just \u2013 which is a comparable number year-over-year or whether there was any asset mix in that so whether we could just look?", "David Rosenthal", "No, that\u2019s pretty comparable.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great. Okay, thanks very much.", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah. I am Sorry I didn\u2019t understand the question. All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "And next we will hear from Doug Leggate with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. Good morning, David.", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning, Doug.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "David I wonder if I could follow-up on the other Doug\u2019s question on margins, your unit margin captures something you have told about periodically in this quarter they had a fairly nice rebound. I am just wondering if you can walk us through any particular reasons behind that and was it just a great operating quarter, how sustainable could this be. And as I can follow-on to that you are going to have about a 1 million barrels a day of new production by your forecast between \u2013 obviously that\u2019s a fairly good churn in the portfolio.", "I am wondering if you could kind of just qualitatively or quantitatively whichever you can do walk through the delta you see in cash margins for the newer projects relative to the existing portfolio, please?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure. Let\u2019s start up with the margin and the margin capture. In addition to some of the volume mix items I mentioned. You actually have some fairly significant mix impacts on the realization side which kind of get massed by some of the markers. So for example if you look this quarter versus the same quarter last year WTI is up over 4 bucks, rents down over $4 but Western Canada Select it was up $9 a barrel as a marker for the Canadian crude.", "So if you think about where we are exposed to Brent overseas a number of production, but including the Abu Dhabi barrels would have some tie to that. Whereas in the US a lot of our production particularly in the Permian would be closer to a WTI spot price and then of course all of our volumes in Canada. So it\u2019s not just Kearl you are talking about Cold Lake and our other production up there. So, think about it as the volumes that went up were attracting the higher margin or the higher price marker crudes. The volumes that declined happened to be the ones that were Brent based and again a big change in those prices did not have much of an earnings impact.", "So you see a nice change on both the volume mix side as well as on the price side. So if kind of back to again and we have been talking about in the last couple of Analyst Meeting\u2019s, growing the liquids and liquids linked volumes, LNG prices were also very attractive in the quarter and we were able to capture those by having some increased volumes in Qatar. So I\u2019d say kind of on a go-forward basis this is probably more typical than what we have seen in the past again given from the mix changes I mentioned.", "If we look at the barrels that we are going to be adding on equivalent basis going forward I wouldn\u2019t give any specific cash margins on those barrels but if you recall back at the Analyst Meeting some of the discussion I think Mark Albers provided in his comments we did talk about that the volumes coming online were going to be generally accretive to our average unit margin and given the fiscal regimes we would be in those projects also accretive to earnings. So I think again as we go forward over the next year or two when we start up these projects we expect to deliver the profitable growth that we talked about in the analyst meeting and we certainly look forward to these projects coming online over the next three years.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. A very quick follow-up, could you give the absolute asset sale gain in the quarter versus the housekeeping point and I will leave it there?", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah, sure if you look at on an earnings basis the absolute gain on asset sales in total was just over $400 million and that was all in the upstream. So the absolute, I just gave you the numbers here for that I know there is going to be interest in the upstream the absolute value of the asset sales on earnings was about $400 million in the first quarter of this year, that compared was lower than and compared to about $800 million in the fourth quarter of last year and we didn\u2019t have any asset sales in the first quarter.", "So you got about a 400 positive delta quarter-over-quarter and almost 400 delta sequentially on the negative side. The other thing I will mention to kind of put the first quarter asset sales into perspective on an absolute basis I mentioned we have 400 million in positive. We had about 200 million of negative tax items and other reserves. So if you kind of think about outside the normal operations of the business we probably had a net absolute value in the upstream of about $200 million.", "Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks a lot David.", "Operator", "And from Jefferies we will hear from Jason (Inaudible).", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, thank you. Hello David.", "David Rosenthal", "Hey, hello Jason.", "Unidentified Analyst", "David I wanted to ask about the PNG LNG projects and congratulations to Exxon for bringing the project on ahead of schedule that something that hasn\u2019t been achieved in that business in quite a while.", "David Rosenthal", "Thank you.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Wanted to ask about the pace of ramp up David, you have made reference to first commercial cargos by the end of the quarter from the first train and start-up production from the second train in several weeks. Would you expect that you could potentially be achieving full production by year-end from both trains from that project?", "David Rosenthal", "It\u2019s first of all thanks for the comments on the project start-up, the team is very proud of. As I mentioned bringing that in early and it looks like certainly within the budget that we had talked about and so we do look for ahead of planned production and cargo deliveries. If we look out towards the end of the year we will certainly be ramping up both the first train and the second train and assuming all that continues to go well, we would expect to see these things ramp up pretty good across the coming months. So it\u2019s a little early for me to give you a definitive answer. But I would say it\u2019s likely that by the time we get to the end of the year we are going to be running at some pretty good operating rates.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay great. And if I could ask you second one David, it\u2019s obviously pretty early days just in terms of sanctions on Russia. But have you had any effects on your ability to invest in the multiple areas where you participate with Rosneft as a partner in Russia?", "David Rosenthal", "With regards to Russia off-course we will comply with all sanctions, but I can tell you on the latter part of your question all of the activities that we had originally planned for this year are underway and proceeding as planned.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great. Thank you David.", "David Rosenthal", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And next we\u2019ll here from Asit Sen with Cowen & Company.", "Asit Sen \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Thanks, good morning David.", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning, Asit. How are you?", "Asit Sen \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Good, thanks. So on PNG LNG as we get closer to the start I was wondering if you could provide some early thoughts on some incremental operational items? First wondering if you could talk about the condensate ratio, second any thoughts on train three expansion potential and finally any thoughts on LNG contract and strategy related to the pricing slope and or your spot exposure?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure. On the condensate ratio I really couldn\u2019t give you a specific number for the expectation there, obviously it\u2019s a very attractive stream. When we look at Train3 we are still evaluating a number of opportunities to expand the plant some of those relate to our own exploration success and other opportunities that we have on our own operated acreage as well as potential other sources of additional gas.", "So that planning and looking and analyzing and discussing that process is ongoing don\u2019t have a definitive outcome for you. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks if you look at the plan as it sits today the cost per MTA in today\u2019s market is very competitive and off-course any additional capacity we take advantage of the existing infrastructure and even be more attractive so we are certainly looking at that.", "If you look at our contracting strategy we entered into long-term oil index price contracts about 95% of the production is already sold under those contracts, customers being in Japan, China and Taiwan. So those contracts are locked up and then you\u2019ll have of course a little bit left over for some spot sales.", "Asit Sen \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Thanks very helpful.", "David Rosenthal", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And from Wells Fargo we got Roger Read.", "Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Yeah, thanks. Good morning.", "David Rosenthal", "Hey, Roger.", "Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Just to come back to the margin discussion and maybe as a better way to understand some of the moving parts going forward. I gather the expansion of liquids or shrinking of the gas and what that should mean from margins as well as the edition of the LNG barrels but I was wondering underlying cost. Can you give us any kind of view of what\u2019s going on there? I mean are we dealing with cost are going to go up but your margins go up faster, cost should hold flat while margins should improve from mix in price maybe a little more detail on that if you could?", "David Rosenthal", "You know as we look at the overall profitability as you mentioned margins are doing better with the mix that we talked about on both the oil and the gas side. In terms of OpEx we are not seeing any significant upward pressure across the portfolio. If you look at that on an absolute basis off-course OpEx is up with startup of some of our big projects Kearl would be a good example on that as we progress from the startup phase last year and to lining up production and ramping up this year you get some benefit of that.", "We did see some lower exploration expense in the first quarter this year as you recall in last year in the second half we booked some fairly heavy exploration expense mainly attributed to our business in Russia and that was a little lower this quarter but as expected. So I\u2019d say overall when you think about the margin capture and the profit capture again it\u2019s the mix that we\u2019ve talked about in particular as we ramp up these projects across the quarter.", "I think the other thing I might add is on the unconventional side we continue to make good progress driving cost down in the areas that we are operating as we\u2019ve talked about before the combination of ExxonMobil\u2019s technology and XTO\u2019s operating experience. We are really starting to see the leverage we get by combining those particularly as we continue to acquire attractive acreage as I mentioned in the Permian would be a good example of that. So across that portfolio that trend continues to be positive in terms of reducing cost and improving capital efficiency. So that part of the business is also doing well.", "Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Okay, great, thanks. And then a follow-up question. Recent headlines indicated Argentina is going to actually be importing some crude obviously you are a major mover and shaker in Vaca Muerta shale. I was wondering have you seen any indications from the Argentinean government that they are willing to be I don\u2019t know a good term flexible in terms of helping to accelerate activity down there?", "David Rosenthal", "I\u2019ll take the last part of your question first. We continue to have ongoing discussions with the government about fiscal terms and stability and I don\u2019t have anything definitive to report on that but those discussions are ongoing. We have seen some positive signals out of the government recently in terms of improving export and import conditions and what we are doing there. These are certainly positive steps that could lead to an attractive business environment. But it\u2019s all part of progressing the programs and determining commerciality.", "Obviously there is a huge potential resource in Argentina called the Vaca Muerta. We continue to have an active program there I think we\u2019ve got a total of six wells down. We\u2019ve been drilling vertical wells in prior to this year, we are starting to drill our first operated horizontal wells. First one is down and second one is drilling and we\u2019ll be getting the third one down shortly. Again without being specific, I can tell you that the data so far from our drilling and delineation is encouraging but it\u2019s still early days to determine actual commerciality. But if you get the combination of good fiscal terms of stability and good resource development that generally leads to a commercial resource development for you.", "So we continue to actively pursue that but again for us it\u2019s a very large resource, we got in at a very low entry cost and very low commitment. And so that allows us to really go about this in a disciplined manner and really utilize some of the expertise XTO has to help us explore and delineate the resource without having to spend a whole lot of money upfront. So again we are encouraged and that piece of the business is moving along very well.", "Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "And next we\u2019ll go to Faisal Khan with Citi.", "Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi", "Hey, good morning it\u2019s Faizal from Citi.", "David Rosenthal", "Good morning, Faizal.", "Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi", "Thanks, David. If you could \u2013 you talked a little bit about sort of the increase in profitability in the upstream business, you also discussed LNG sort of prices. Can you remind us how much of your total LNG volumes are exposed to the spot market?", "David Rosenthal", "You know I don\u2019t have a total global number on that. I think probably what would be more indicative is if you look at \u2013 if you take the U.S. aside of course and you look at our total LNG volumes. Most of those are going at oil index prices but the rest of them by and large are going into the Asia Pacific rim. And so the spot prices there are fairly close to the oil index prices and so you are getting a nice benefit there. As well the occasional cargo that goes into Europe goes into the spot price but those are attractive as well.", "So regardless of how the cargo is going either directly or indirectly \u2013 most of them or probably all of it about 5% are either oil indexed or getting the equivalent type prices.", "Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi", "Okay. I guess I was just trying to understand the commentary given that oil prices haven\u2019t moved all that much sequentially quarter to quarter but it sounded like that was a typically strong point for you in the quarter.", "David Rosenthal", "Thank you. It was and a lot of it is the mix on where these cargo\u2019s get delivered and whether they are going to Europe or they are going to the Asia Pacific rim or whether you have a little higher proportion going into your fixed contracts versus your spot. So we did see a little uplift on those prices as you know not all those contracts are the same in terms of how they look back and what the formula is. But if we look across for example our LNG realizations out of Qatar and you are just looking quarter-on-quarter this year to last year we were up a little over a $1 a KCF.", "Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi", "Okay.", "David Rosenthal", "So, again a nice piece of business.", "Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi", "Yeah. And thanks I appreciate that detail. And then just back to Russia for a second I believe you guys have some sort of asset swap sort of arrangement with Rosneft that sort of protects you in case some of the investments get stranded in Russia. Can you just walk us through a little bit of that in case there are sanctions as there are [Inaudible]here in the U.S with the sort of assets that Rosneft has swapped into with you and that sort [Inaudible]you guys put together?", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah. I really can\u2019t comment on the terms and conditions of those pieces of business other than yeah we have the projects that we have in Russia and they farmed into some of our properties on a normal farming basis just like anybody else would. But any discussion of contractual details or commercial arrangements really couldn\u2019t comment on.", "Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi", "Okay. Got it. Thanks David. I appreciate the time.", "David Rosenthal", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And from Barclays we\u2019ll hear from Paul Cheng.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays", "Hey guys. Good morning.", "David Rosenthal", "Hi Paul. How are you doing?", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays", "Hi, very good. Dave, two quick questions. One you told about the over \u2013 benefit in the first quarter. Can you give us or quantify what\u2019s the volume and also the dollar value and also at the end of the first quarter whether from an inventory standpoint you are roughly [Inaudible] or underneath?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure. If you are looking in the first quarter relative to the first quarter last year.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays", "Can we look at relative to the \u2013 to your production actually?", "David Rosenthal", "Sure. I mean we are about 15 kbd over lifted in the quarter, yeah on an absolute basis were about 15 kbd over lifted and I would estimate that to be about worth about a $100 million.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays", "Okay. And that at the end of the first quarter are you [Inaudible] balance at this point?", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah. If we look at where we are just at the end of the first quarter I think we are over lifted just a little bit so we are not completely in balance but we are fairly close.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays", "Okay. Second question on Permian right now you are running at 10 rigs. Is there any color or insight you can provide on what this [Inaudible]going to [Inaudible]look like over the next two or three years. You just add two should we assume that you will continue to ramp up the program there. And also whether you can tell us the $90,000 barrel per day production, what\u2019s the mix between light oil, condensate, NGL and natural gas?", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah. Let me start with the first part. We are of course ramping up activity in the Permian. We are doing it like we always do in a very disciplined approach you don\u2019t want to get too far out in front your headlight. So we have been building that rig count over the first last few quarters I did mention the additional acreage that we picked up in a very attractive area in the Wolfcamp.", "So as we move on I would expect the trajectory to be the same but I don\u2019t have any specific count for you. Again in a lot of these areas we are still delineating, we are still appraising, we are still experimenting with how we go about drilling and completing wells and that sort of thing. But I think directionally given the quality of the acreage that we have and the results we have had to date I think it would be a reasonable expectation that we would likely grow that rig count over the course of the year I think that will be logical. But again always in a manner that keeps in mind the long term development of these resources and not getting out too far in front and doing something that you regret later.", "So it\u2019s all about assessing what we\u2019ve got, we are very, very pleased with our acreage and then ramping up that production as is appropriate and leading towards that outlook we gave you in the Analyst Meeting that showed a nice way up between now and 2017 in total North American\u2019s liquid production but the Permian seems to be a big part of that. In terms of the on split on the liquids versus NGLs versus condensates I don\u2019t have that split for you, Paul.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays", "Okay. Thank you.", "David Rosenthal", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And from Credit Suisse we\u2019ll hear from Edward Westlake.", "Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Hey yes. Good morning, David. Three very quick tail end questions. People have said and thanks by the way for the helpful color on Asia LNG and well done on the execution of some of the key projects. Some of the people have shouted out a gas marketing benefit in given the cold winter in the U.S, did you guys have any something there that we should think about?", "David Rosenthal", "Well I mean we benefited from the higher gas prices but other than that we certainly don\u2019t do any trading if that\u2019s what you are looking at. So let me if that was the question let me be clear all of our earnings uplift comes from the production and sale of our gas we don\u2019t do any trading.", "Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. Good. And then switching to the international chemicals I mean obviously 4Q was weak and you\u2019ve seen a bit of a comeback in Q1. Maybe just talk a little bit about you shouted out lower other expenses maybe just a bit of shout on what\u2019s happening there.", "David Rosenthal", "Sure. If we just as so we weren\u2019t from the fourth quarter into the first quarter this year we didn\u2019t have some significantly lower maintenance expense you might recall in the fourth quarter. It was pretty high, we had some turnaround activity going on in Singapore and that\u2019s all behind us and that\u2019s the biggest driver in that other bucket.", "Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse", "So it\u2019s not a sort of fee change in demand that you see in the chemical chain?", "David Rosenthal", "I wouldn\u2019t say a fee change but I would say that we are seeing some encouraging signs the integrated chemical chain or seeing some pickup in demand polyethylene sales have been good and we continue to see some nice demand pickup there. We did also see some pickup which was seasonal between the fourth quarter and the first quarter in our specialties business. But on the other hand aromatics demand is weak strictly in this, so there are some offsets. But I think generally speaking we have seen a little better demand, we have been able to sell the increased production out of Singapore so that part of the business is going well.", "So I think as you kind of go from fourth quarter to first quarter in the chemical business, lower maintenance as we move into the \u2013 from the first quarter to the second quarter as you are probably aware we are heading under a higher maintenance period. The chem plant for example came down in early April and is down for a couple of months\u2019 turnaround, so we will see that impact. But a really nice first quarter operations on the chemical side I think our capacity utilization particularly in North America where of course we get a nice margin benefit I think we were running about 2% or 3% on a capacity utilization better than industry.", "So that\u2019s not only good in total but on the margin those couple percent really, really ring the cash register for you on those sales. So good quarter for us in the chemical business.", "Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And just on the cash flow statement working capital contribution in the quarter?", "David Rosenthal", "Our working capital contributions I recall just under $2 billion about $1.8 billion and that was just a change in payables.", "Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Right.", "David Rosenthal", "I think not a real big effect if you think about total cash flows a number less than $2 billion in the quarter but it was payables driven.", "Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And then one bigger picture question. They always talk about Shell but I mean obviously you\u2019ve been doing a lot of offshore exploration as well. When do you think you will get to the point where you can sort of update us in terms of actually getting after to sort of developing some of these deep water fields that you\u2019ve got in the portfolio?", "David Rosenthal", "Yeah. I think as-soon-as we have a little better indication exactly on what we\u2019ve got in some of these areas, one that I can mention is Tanzania where we have had significant success and our planning is underway as we speak not only with our partner in Block 2 Statoil but also with BG and Ophir broadly across Tanzania.", "So we are working at evaluating potential sites for an LNG facility and we have made a recommendation to the government and studies are progressing you know to really determine what would be the optimum development plan for our block and across that area.", "So I would say all of that is progressing as you would expect for a resource of that size. But I can\u2019t give you a definitive development plan or timing yet. Julie is another deepwater project that\u2019s well underway and we\u2019ll start drilling there this year. We\u2019ve got more drilling to do in Romania where we had a very nice successful initial well there. So a lot going in some very attractive areas, but probably still just a little early to be talking definitive development plans or startups or FIDs or that sort of things.", "Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And next from Morgan Stanley we\u2019ll hear from Evan Calio.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Yes, good afternoon David. More housekeeping from me, exploration expenses much lower in the quarter like 338 versus normal. Is that just timing event or is there any exploration spend trending over there.", "David Rosenthal", "I wouldn\u2019t say there is any lower trend, it\u2019s really particularly if you look quarter-on-quarter it was really just timing of expenditure, particularly in Russia and some other areas, but the program remains on track, on schedule. And I think you\u2019ll probably see a little more normalized kind a trend as we go out into the year.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Great. On the asset again and you gave just color earlier, the included income. Was that in international upstream gaining more?", "David Rosenthal", "That was in international upstream.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Got it. And maybe just lastly from me with cash builds equaling asset sales for you in the quarter, what was the consideration to for holding the buyback flat sequentially. And then how do you what do you need to see you think to raise it. Thank you.", "David Rosenthal", "Yes I wouldn\u2019t. No change in our strategy with regard to shareholder distributions in general. You saw we got a nice 9.5% bump in the dividend this quarter continuing a nice trend that you\u2019ve seen the last few years. So growing that dividend and making sure it\u2019s reliable and consistent continues to be at the top of the list for shareholder distribution. The buyback continues to be [out]. But the cash we have and although we do look at it on a quarter-by-quarter basis, we are always thinking into account cash flow projections and business and that\u2019s sort of thing.", "So again on a company our size, plus or minus the $1 billion not a big number. I do think that it\u2019s noteworthy if you look at the free cash flow for example in the quarter particularly relative to the last few quarters, we did generate a total of $16 billion, put a bunch of that into the business funded the both the dividend and the buyback, and still had $2 billion over half we paid down debt and half we increased cash. So again if you\u2019re looking kind a sequentially across the last few quarters, very strong quarter in cash flow consistent with the strong quarter in earnings.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Got it. Thank you.", "David Rosenthal", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And from Raymond James we\u2019ll go Pavel Molchanov.", "Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James", "Thanks for taking the question. One more on the cash allocation, by my math this will the first quarter that your dividend payout $[40] billion equals your share buyback. Is that deliberate and do you see the Q lines kind a continuing to cross that line?", "David Rosenthal", "I would say that was a coincidence. It\u2019s not a there is not deliberate effort to match those out or more change any ratios to that\u2019s sort.", "Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay. And this maybe most relevant for your German acreage, but in the context of the Ukrainian crisis and lot of rhetoric in Europe about ramping up shale development, any sense that permitting in Germany or elsewhere in Europe is starting to open up?", "David Rosenthal", "No, I don\u2019t have any indication of that. There is a lot of discussion going on as you\u2019re all aware but nothing definitive nothing different than what\u2019s been going on. As you know we have a very attractive acreage position in Germany and we\u2019ve been in discussions with the regulators for a while on the potential of that resource and those in fact the discussions are going but nothing is specific to report on today.", "Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay, thank you guys.", "David Rosenthal", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We have one question left in the queue and that will come from Peter [Hudson] with RBC.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good afternoon. Just two quick follow ups. Kashagan you said no volumes is expect, kind of expected anyway in 2014. But I wonder whether you could say what do you had in your plans for 2016 and what those still are? And also on the upside you are talking about Tanzania. Is taken quite some time since the recommendation has gone in about the location of the plant facility. But still nothing is come out.", "Do we have a timing of when we might get that as the next catalyst in that area? And then finally, the downstream, you stress the words on the international downstream that was a least quite a lower than the number of people had expected, profitability levels back to the sort of early 2009.", "One of your competitors took a big impairment on the refining assets in Asia and are being very clear about the weakness, structural weakness in that market. Is there something that you\u2019re seeing such as that and expect to continue out into the medium and long-term as well. Thank you.", "David Rosenthal", "Let me take those in order here. In Kashagan as I mentioned in the outlook, we showed in March we did not a value for 2014. We did have some volumes in 2015. I don\u2019t want to give a specific number here today, but we did have assumed some production volume in 2015. In Tanzania, we don\u2019t have any final determination on the site, but I will tell you the discussions are ongoing and going well. Nothing out of the ordinary and the plans for that are progressing at an appropriate pace.", "So I think I will stop there. So we look at the downstream on the international side, yes you did see some weak earnings there overall. We had a positive impact in Canada, if you saw the IOL results out this morning, very nice business there. We\u2019re running obviously vantage crews into this refinery. And that keeps the business just going well. Outside of Canada, the rest, particularly in Europe and Asia-Pac were weak. The biggest driver there is the margin.", "You had some surplus refining capacity come online in that area of the world last couple of years. And the advance are a little weak so you got some capacity expansion and excess of demand growth. We do see some weakness there. We are doing a number of things to improve our profitability there and improve our competitiveness.", "We\u2019ve been spending sometime on logistics and expanding feedstock flexibility, working to increase exposure to high value product yields and less exposure to lower margin products, continuing to work on operating expense and maximizing the logistics benefits we get both from the location of our refineries particularly in Europe, but also that integration, full integration with the chemical business and the lose business which is doing quite well.", "So I think if you look at that business it\u2019s weak it\u2019s been weak for a little while. These are always cyclical business both in Europe and in the US and in the Asia-Pacific rim. So you wouldn\u2019t want to take current results and draw a long-term trend. We\u2019re doing what we can, controlling what we can control. And really it\u2019s about making sure your refineries and your plans for that matter in any region are the most competitive in that region. And that\u2019s what benefits you over the long term.", "When you talk about a potential impairment, we follow US GAAP with regard to impairment, and we look at that as appropriate, but from our perspective and this preference from company to follow IFRS accounting rules when we look at the US GAAP accounting we don\u2019t see any exposure to that in that part of the world.", "Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James", "Great, thank you.", "David Rosenthal", "Yes one of the things you might recall just quickly when you look across both the downstream and the chemical segment bear in mind the significant advantage we have on an ROCE basis to the rest of the industry. So when you look at the denominator when you look at the capital employed in our business both on the chemical side and on the downstream side, our capital employed tends to be in order of magnitude lower than the others.", "So that helps generate the ROCEs but also gives you feel for how much capital is on the book. And then the other thing of course we benefit from is the level integration we have. So we even as refining cycle is one way and chemical is on other one you get some offsets and when they\u2019re both on an upswing that\u2019s where you see the benefit of that integration, so. Across the business we continue to do well to generate the highest returns in the business and just don\u2019t have any long-term concerns.", "Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay, thanks very much.", "David Rosenthal", "All right. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And Mr. Rosenthal there are no other questions at this time.", "David Rosenthal", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen that does concludes today\u2019s presentation.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's Second Quarter Earnings Call and Webcast. The focus of this call is ExxonMobil's financial and operating results for the second quarter. I will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website.", "Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2.", "Moving to Slide 3. We provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global economic growth improved modestly in the second quarter. U.S. economic activity recovered after contracting in the first quarter. China's growth rate strengthened due to increased exports and government stimulus, while Europe's economic recovery remained moderate.", "Energy markets delivered mixed results. WTI prices increased by more than $4 a barrel, narrowing the discount to Brent, while Western Canadian Select prices also strengthened. U.S. natural gas prices decreased compared to the first quarter. Global industry refining margins strengthened, while strong chemical commodity margins were offset by weaker specialty margins.", "Turning now to the financial results, as shown on Slide 4.", "ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings were $8.8 billion or $2.05 per share. The corporation distributed $6 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and our share repurchase program. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding were $3 billion. CapEx was $9.8 billion in the quarter and $18.2 billion year-to-date, down 17% from the first half of 2013. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $12.8 billion, including proceeds associated with asset sales of $2.6 billion. At the end of the quarter, cash totaled $6.3 billion and debt was $21.8 billion.", "The next slide provides additional detail on second quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter, cash increased by about $500 million from $5.8 billion to $6.3 billion. Earnings, depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items, and our ongoing asset management program yielded $12.8 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included net investments in the business of $6.7 billion and shareholder distributions of $6 billion. Other financing activities increased cash by $400 million. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $3 billion in the third quarter of 2014.", "Moving on to Slide 6 and a review of our segmented results.", "ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings of $8.8 billion increased by $1.9 billion from the second quarter 2013, primarily reflecting gains on asset sales and higher earnings across all business segments. In the sequential quarter comparison, shown on Slide 7, earnings decreased by $320 million, as lower Downstream and Chemical earnings and higher corporate and financing expenses were partly offset by higher Upstream earnings. Guidance for corporate and financing expenses remains at $500 million to $700 million a quarter.", "Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results, and starting on Slide 8. Upstream earnings in the second quarter were $7.9 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion versus the second quarter of 2013. Realizations increased earnings by $580 million, primarily driven by higher liquids realizations. On a worldwide basis, crude oil realizations increased by $4.48 per barrel. Worldwide natural gas realizations decreased $0.39 per thousand cubic feet, as higher U.S. gas prices were offset by lower international realizations. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $200 million due to a net underlift, primarily in West Africa, and lower gas volumes. Excluding the underlift impact, volume/mix was a positive factor of about $50 million, reflecting higher-margin production growth, primarily from North America and Papua New Guinea. All other items increased earnings by $1.2 billion mainly due to gains on asset sales in Hong Kong.", "Moving to Slide 9. Excluding the impact of the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry, oil-equivalent production decreased by 2.3% compared to the second quarter of last year. Liquids production was up 8,000 barrels per day. Increased U.S. liquids production and [indiscernible] volumes were mostly offset by a scheduled maintenance in Canada and Kazakhstan, base decline and unfavorable entitlement and divestment impacts. Natural gas production was down 604 million cubic feet per day, as lower weather-related demand in Europe and expected fuel decline were partly offset by new production from PNG LNG.", "Turning now to the sequential comparison, starting on Slide 10. Upstream earnings increased $98 million versus the first quarter. Realizations reduced earnings by $200 million. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $620 million, reflecting expected lower seasonal demand in Europe, scheduled maintenance and underlift impacts primarily in West Africa. All other items had a positive impact of $920 million, primarily driven by net gains on asset sales. Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel were $23.07, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interest volumes.", "Moving to Slide 11. Excluding the impact of the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry, volumes were down 288,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day or about 6.9% sequentially. Liquids production was down 77,000 barrels per day mainly due to scheduled maintenance in Canada, Kazakhstan and the North Sea, along with unfavorable entitlement impacts. Increased U.S. liquids production provided a partial offset. Natural gas volumes were down 1.3 billion cubic feet per day, reflecting lower seasonal demand in Europe and cutter [ph] Downtime, partly offset by the addition of PNG LNG volumes.", "Moving now to the Downstream financial and operating results, starting on Slide 12. Downstream earnings for the first quarter were $711 million, up $315 million from the second quarter of 2013. Margins decreased earnings by $330 million, driven by lower non-U.S. refining margins. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $280 million, reflecting reduced planned maintenance activities. Other items increased earnings by $370 million primarily due to the absence of Dartmouth Refinery conversion costs and lower maintenance expenses.", "Turning to Slide 13. Sequentially, second quarter Downstream earnings decreased by $102 million primarily due to unfavorable volume/mix effects and higher maintenance activities, partially offset by higher margins.", "Moving now to the Chemical financial and operating results, and starting on Slide 14. Second quarter Chemical earnings were $841 million, up $85 million versus the prior year quarter mainly due to favorable volume/mix and ForEx effects. Stronger commodity margins were offset by weaker specialties margins.", "Moving to Slide 15. Sequentially, Chemical earnings decreased by $206 million primarily due to lower specialty margins and higher planned maintenance activities.", "Moving now to an update on year-to-date cash flow growth, as shown on Slide 16.", "Strong free cash flow of $14.8 billion represented an increase of $12.1 billion compared to the first half of 2013. Cash flow from operations and asset sales of $29 billion more than covered the $14.2 billion invested in the business and $11.7 billion distributed to shareholders, with remaining cash used for other financing activities and addition to our cash balance. This year-to-date free cash flow growth reflects our strong operational performance, ongoing asset management program and a disciplined capital allocation approach.", "As highlighted in our March Analyst Meeting, we are starting up a number of major projects that will add significant profitable volume growth. Our world-class project execution capabilities are enabling us to make significant progress and achieve key milestones. One of these milestones was the PNG LNG project startup in April, which was months ahead of schedule. We have now ramped up to full production through both LNG trains and are currently producing close to 1 billion cubic feet of gas per day. Through July, we have already loaded 15 cargoes for delivery to customers in Asia. The project was completed below the $19 billion budget announced in 2012 and produces LNG at a unit cost that is one of the lowest in the region. This achievement is a good example of how ExxonMobil creates value through technology applications and leading project execution capabilities. Learnings will be applied to other LNG projects that we plan to progress.", "In Angola, the CLOV project, of which ExxonMobil owns a 20% interest, started operations in June. Production is now ramping up and expected to reach 160,000 barrels per day. Offshore Sakhalin Island, the top side of the Berkut platform has been installed onto the gravity-based structure at the Arkutun-Dagi field. The operations set a world record for installation of the heaviest integrated topside structure, weighing over 42,000 tons and using the world's largest ocean-going barge to carry and then set the structure. Berkut is now the largest offshore oil and gas production platform in Russia. The facility will start up later this year and will add up to 90,000 barrels per day to Sakhalin-1 oil production.", "Let me now provide a quick update on Kashagan. The project partners have agreed to work towards a progressive transition from the current venture model to a consolidated joint venture company operating under a single corporate management system, integrating the existing processes and tools from the venture entities. An experienced ExxonMobil executive has been appointed as the Managing Director of the operating company. Regarding the pipeline issues, the current assessment is that both oil and gas pipelines need to be replaced. The North Caspian Operating Company is now developing a full replacement plan.", "Turning now to Slide 18 for an update on our exploration activities.", "In Argentina, we drilled and successfully completed 2 ExxonMobil-operated horizontal wells in the Vaca Muerta formation. The Bajo del Choique X-2 well flowed at an average rate of 770 barrels of oil per day, while the La Invernada X-3 well will be flow-tested during the third quarter. Our active program continues, with additional wells planned to be drilled in the second half of the year.", "In Tanzania, Statoil and ExxonMobil made an additional discovery in Block 2. The Piri-1 well discovered gas in a high-quality reservoir, confirming an additional 2 to 3 TCF of gas in place. 6 gas discoveries in Block 2 have been made to date, with total resource in place estimated at 20 TCF. ExxonMobil, Statoil, BG and Ophir completed an evaluation of potential sites for our common onshore LNG plant and made a location recommendation to the government of Tanzania.", "Drilling operations are also currently underway on 2 blocks in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. At Pirmam, we have successfully drilled to target depth and are preparing to test the well in the third quarter. In Alqosh, we are drilling ahead and anticipate reaching target depth in the third quarter.", "In Romania, we have spud the Domino-2 well in the Neptun Block in the Black Sea. Data collected from the well will aid in the development planning for the gas field discovered in 2012 by the Domino-1 well. We will then move on to additional exploration drilling in the block.", "Turning now to Slide 19 and an update on our Downstream business. During the quarter, we achieved notable investment milestones to increase high-value product sales. We commissioned the Clean Fuels project at the Saudi Aramco Mobil Refinery in Saudi Arabia. The project reduces sulfur levels in gasoline and diesel by more than 98% to meet more stringent fuel standards in the kingdom. The project included new hydrotreating and sulfur recovery facilities and started up successfully and on budget.", "In China, we completed the expansion of the Tianjin lubricants plant to increase the supply of high-value Mobil-branded lubricants. Work is also underway to significantly increase the blending capacity at the Taicang lubricant plant, with expected completion by the end of 2015. Together, these 2 projects will increase our local capacity by 75% and help meet the growing demand for high-quality lubricants in China.", "We also recently approved a project to install a new 50,000 barrels per day delayed coker unit at our Antwerp refinery in Belgium. The unit will convert low-value residual oil from our Northwest Europe refineries into higher-value transportation fuel products such as diesel. This is another example of selective investments we are making at our competitively advantaged sites, further strengthening our industry-leading portfolio. Startup is planned for 2017.", "Turning now to Slide 20 and an update on our Chemical business, where we are also progressing several projects to grow high-value product sales.", "We received all final regulatory approvals and started construction of a multibillion-dollar ethane cracker at our existing fully integrated Baytown, Texas, complex and associated premium product facilities in nearby Mont Belvieu. The steam cracker will have a capacity of up to 1.5 million tons per year and provide ethylene feedstock for further chemical processing at 2 new 650,000 tons per year high-performance polyethylene lines. This project is made possible, in large part, by abundant affordable supplies of U.S. natural gas for energy and chemical feedstock. The expansion will enable us to economically supply rapidly growing demand for high-value polyethylene products used in a variety of consumer and industrial applications. Startup is planned in 2017.", "We also recently approved expansions of our specialty hydrocarbon fluid facilities in Antwerp and Singapore. These projects will upgrade refinery streams into higher-value specialty chemical products to serve rapidly growing demand in extended-reach drilling, hydraulic fracturing and other industrial applications. These investments underscore the benefits of our business integration and technology advantage to capture advantage feedstocks and increase high-value product sales. Startups are planned in 2015 and 2016.", "I would like to conclude today's presentation with a summary of our year-to-date performance.", "ExxonMobil's strong financial and operating results reflect our ability to grow cash flow and provide robust shareholder returns, as we presented during the Analyst Meeting in March. Total earnings year-to-date, $17.9 billion, reflecting solid operating performance across all of our businesses and our ongoing asset management program. In the Upstream, production of 4 million oil-equivalent barrels per day is right in line with our plans. Actions we took to improve Upstream profitability and grow higher-margin production increased unit earnings to $22.19 per barrel, up from $18.03 a barrel in 2013. In the Downstream and Chemical businesses, we progressed attractive investments to strengthen the portfolio and continue to leverage integration benefits.", "Our strong operating results, combined with our disciplined capital allocation approach, generated robust free cash flow of $14.8 billion, an increase of $12.1 billion compared to the first half of 2013. This strong performance enabled us to maintain industry-leading shareholder distributions.", "That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.", "Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC", "David, what have the impacts of sanctions been on your operations in Russia?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, look, Paul, I know our activities in Russia are a matter of great interest to you and everybody else on the call and rightfully so. But what I can tell you as of this morning is that we are waiting for further details on the sanctions in order to better understand how we need to comply. But I have to tell you, given that we simply don't have sufficient information, I'm just not in a position this morning to comment any further on the impact of the sanctions.", "Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Okay. The CapEx in Russia, is that financed from within Russia? I was thinking that given the scale of your operations in Sakhalin, maybe it's kind of an internally -- an internal Russian financing operation?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, I really don't have the details of that. We finance our operations in a number of different ways. And I don't really have a specific comment on Sakhalin or the rest of our activities.", "Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC", "So essentially, the status is that we're -- you're waiting for more clarification on any limits that may be placed on, I guess, investment and operations?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, and as you know, what's been in the press has been people's thoughts and expectations, but we really just haven't seen the detailed written sanctions. And so until we have those and have a chance to assess them and evaluate them, again it just puts me in a position this morning where I really can't make any specific comments.", "Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Understood. And then my follow-up is totally separate. The construction started at Baytown you highlighted, that, I think, is advanced against schedule, isn't it? And is that fully permitted, and obviously, final investment decision and everything else? And what is the expected completion date?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, that project is right on our plan. We do have all of our permits in place. Construction has started. We put that picture in the slides this morning to kind of show we're digging dirt and the project's underway. Even throughout the permitting process, we were well underway getting all the engineering lined up, all the contractors, all the supply chain so that once we had the permits, we were ready to go. So no change to what we told you at the Analyst Meeting. We're on schedule so far, and we do expect to have that project up and running sometime in 2017.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So a couple of questions, please. The promise of improving on operating cash flow is obviously a big theme from your Analyst Day. We don't really see any substantial margin change this quarter with the startup of PNG and, I guess, Kearl ramping up. So I'm just wondering if you can frame for us how you see the -- what the drivers of that change in cash flow are in terms perhaps of how the margin could change for your new portfolio of assets, which I guess will be about a quarter of the company in 2017? And any color you can give, qualitatively if necessary, but just to give some comfort that, that turn is coming? And I've got a follow-up, please.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, sure, Doug. Let's talk about that a little bit as we look at how things have really evolved over the last, say, 12 months. We have seen some pretty significant increase in our unit profitability and our ability to capture changes in the realizations as they come along. If I look at where we are so far in the first half of '14 on Upstream profitability relative to 2013, we're up over $4 a barrel on unit profitability. And if I go back and I take out all of the asset management, asset sales, related gains in all the periods, unit profitability is up right at $2. So I think you're starting to see the impact of the trend that we talked about in the Analyst Meeting of reducing our exposure to lower-margin barrels and barrels where we don't have quite the upside potential. And you're just now starting to see some of the projects that we've talked extensively about coming online. I mean Papua New Guinea LNG is an example. It's just started up, but it's one of several projects to come on in the next couple of years, as we talked about at the Analyst Meeting, all of which are accretive to average unit profitability and average unit cash flow. So I think, in our production volumes, we're starting to see the benefit of that. Again, it's early. We've just started up the project. We have a number of projects yet to come over the course of the year. Of course, Papua New Guinea will be ramping up. We'll have the Lucius project coming up later in the year. And I might give you an update on that, as you know, at the time of the Analyst Meeting, and when we put out our F&O review, we had a 15% interest in the Lucius project. That interest is now up to 23% -- a little over 23% through a normal redetermination exercise as well as our exercising our preemptive rights on the Apache sales. So that project will be starting up later this year, and again, we'll have about 23% of those barrels. Hadrian South will also start up at the same time. So again, the projects we talked about are on schedule, and they're coming online. And they will be accretive to those, to the unit profitability we talked about. There's a number of other things that you see as we progress through and looking at the year-to-date cash flow, including an active asset management program, and you saw the impact of that. So as I kind of look back really at the first half and kind of staying away from the first quarter versus the second quarter and looking at the 6 months, we are spot on the outlook we gave you on production in the Analyst Meeting. As you've seen in our supplement, U.S. liquids production is up fairly significantly, and we continue to grow that production as we said we would. That will also add to the improving margins. So cash flow's good. Free cash flow is dramatically better than last year. We're continuing to provide the shareholder with strong returns. We raised the dividend again, as you know, almost 10% in the second quarter. So as we kind of sit back, and we look at the first half results and compare to what our plans were and compared to last year, we're very encouraged and very confident that we'll continue to deliver the growth that we had talked about and continue to trend up on unit profitability and the cash flow. So from our perspective, everything's right on track, and we look forward to continuing to deliver the commitments we've made to the shareholder.", "Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I'll make my follow-up a very quick one, hopefully. So assuming the spending level does hold around the $37 billion number, all things equal, it's the age-old question for you guys: You're going to have a lot of free cash flow. How are you thinking about the dividend nowadays as opposed to stepping up the buyback? Because when we traveled recently, I think your message was, \"well, that cash flow will go back to shareholders.\" So if you could help frame the importance of one over the other as you stabilize the underlying production base, that would be helpful. And I'll leave it there.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure. Thanks, Doug. As you mentioned, at constant prices, yes, as we deliver the plan that we outlined at the Analyst Meeting, we do expect to see a continued increase on our cash flow generation. And keeping the CapEx at the levels we discussed would, by definition, improve free cash flow, again just as we've seen dramatically here in the first half. In terms of the capital allocation, no change to our prior approach. We're going to stay disciplined on the capital. We're going to fund our best projects. And I think, as we've talked about in the Analyst Meeting and folks are beginning to recognize, our opportunity portfolio is quite extensive at this point, and that's going to allow us to be selective. So we'll continue to be disciplined on the capital side. We will continue to pay a very consistent and increasing dividend over time, and I think you've certainly seen evidence of that over the last few years. And after you accomplish those 2 things, the rest of the cash flow will flow back to the shareholder through the share buyback program. So no change in approach, no change in how we're doing our capital allocation, but again, we are certainly looking forward to continued success in our project ramp-up, continued success in upgrading the value of our molecules in the Downstream and Chemical and delivering that profitable growth that we talked about a lot in the Analyst Meeting. So thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Ed Westlake with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "David, very small question first, just on asset sale gains in the quarter, if you shout out the actual number in this quarter, if you have that?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure. In total, the gains from asset sales on an absolute basis were about $1.7 billion, $1.6 billion of that in the Upstream and the other $100 million in the Downstream and Chemical.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Let's talk bigger picture about the Permian. Obviously, at the Analyst Day, you spoke about 1.5 million acres. Do you have a breakdown of how much of that is kind of CBP, how much is that is Midland?", "[Audio Gap]", "Delaware Basin for more the application of horizontal drilling?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure. I'll start out by saying, if you look at that whole 1.5 million acres, it is spread throughout the Midland basin and the Delaware Basin. We're in a number of different areas, and that really gives us the opportunity to do a number of things to grow our production there, including a lot of things in the conventional fields, water floods, CO2 floods. We've got 65 workover rigs still running in the Permian, in addition to the other rigs that we have drilling exploration wells. So we have a lot of exposure to both conventional and unconventional, again, across -- broadly across the basin in Texas and in New Mexico. As we look at the various areas that I know people are interested in, we certainly have some very good acreage in the prime areas for the Wolfcamp, and we're just getting started in there. The Bone Springs is another one that we're working on. So when you look at this ramp-up in growth that we've seen to date, and you've seen the numbers of the significant growth in liquids in the U.S. year-over-year, we are just now beginning to scratch the unconventional plays and getting some of those wells down and see what we've got going on. We've got about 5 rigs drilling horizontal wells today in, again, the Wolfcamp, the Bone Springs and a number of areas. We have brought 93 wells online this year. That's up almost 70% from last year about this time. So a lot of activity, a lot of growth but just scratching the surface of the potential in that area. So we're excited to have the opportunities that we have across the basin, across the platform and, in particular, the wide variety of things we have to work on in that play. So it's not just unconventional. It's a number of resource opportunities, and you'll continue to see us ramp up activity there and see that production. Again, as we talked about at the Analyst Meeting, that is a big-time focus area for us, as is the Bakken where we're having tremendous success as well, and the Woodford Ardmore area. So I can tell you, sitting here mid-year, the opportunity is there. We're developing it, and we're seeing that production increase right in line with our expectations.", "Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And if I can be very sneaky: Is it fee acreage, or is it more recently sold in the Permian? I'm thinking about the royalty position. Some are starting to disclose where they are on that.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Oh, yes, we -- no, we've got -- most of our acreage is fee acreage. And as you know, that's a big help on the royalties.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "I had a question for you on the production profile. I know you kind of confirmed that you're on track to meet your full year target. 2Q came in a bit light compared to what we were looking for. I know you referenced some maintenance and European nominations were weak. Is it fair, as we kind of move into second half, to think that 2Q is a low point? I know you'll have CLOV ramping up and maybe some of that maintenance coming back online. Or any color you can give us on how to kind of think about second half of the year?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, sure. If we look at the first half in particular, if we look sequentially where the volumes came down quite a bit. Just on the liquids side, downtime was worth 66,000 barrels a day for us from first quarter to second quarter. So we had a very heavy maintenance load up in Canada; in Kazakhstan, at Tengiz; and a number of other places, in North Sea, for example. So while we did see the benefit from projects at PNG and Kearl, they were masked by, again, this planned maintenance, seasonal maintenance, but it did have quite an impact on us. As we typically do going forward into the second half, that maintenance gets done and those things come back. And the other impact we had sequentially again was a sharp reduction in gas sales. I think our demand in Europe was probably worth over 150,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day on the gas side. And then we also had some downtime. So I'd characterize -- if you're looking at the second quarter, characterized by a extremely heavy maintenance load and your typical seasonal decline in Europe volume coming off a low base, because of the low winter. So the offset of that, of course, is PNG LNG starting up. The increase you've seen in the higher-margin U.S. liquids volumes. They just weren't enough to offset these other factors. As we head into the second half of the year, you will see these maintenance items come back up, as they typically do, and then the project startups that I talked about: full ramp-up of PNG LNG; and then the other projects that I mentioned, Lucius and some of the other ones. So we would certainly expect to see the benefit of both of those factors coming out of the second quarter. And that's why I really wanted to focus a little bit of time this morning on how we're doing year-to-date, because I think the real key measure of our performance and whether or not we're delivering on the targets that we established at the March Analyst Meeting is we are right on plan. In fact, we're a little ahead in some areas, like U.S. liquids production, for example; PNG LNG, a little ahead. Some other things are a little behind, European demand, for example, on the gas side. We continue to ramp up Kearl, and that progress is also looking good as we head into the second half of the year. So again, if we look past the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations and focus on where we're at year-to-date and what we're expecting in the second half, I can assure you we are spot on to deliver the outlook that we gave you.", "Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "The second question. One of your European counterparts has just announced the -- I guess, the initial steps to form an MLP. And it seems like Exxon is flushed with assets that would probably fit very nicely into one and really highlight the underlying value that's probably not reflected in the stock. I'm just curious if that is even on the radar screen?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Well, I'd say kind of generically everything's on the radar screen. We are just constantly looking at all of the things that are out there, all the options we have to realize full value from all of our assets, including our midstream assets. The one thing I'd remind you, if you recall, back in the 2011 and 2012 time frame, we actually sold a number of our midstream assets and realized extensive value for those. And those are reflected in the very strong gains on asset sales and cash flow we generated. Now if you look, step back and look at MLPs: Most companies are using those as a means to raise cash and finance growth or reduce their ownership costs or exposure. Those aren't strategic drivers for us. In our case, when we look at our midstream portfolio, these are strategic assets to us. We think we are monetizing the value of those, whether or not you would assert that they're adequately reflected in our share price yet. We are certainly monetizing those and maximizing the value in the integration of our full value chain and also as part of our logistics and integration between the Upstream, Downstream and chemicals. So you probably won't be surprised to know that we've taken a hard look at this and look at the assets and the opportunities, but we're -- we like what we have. We like the integration benefit. And in fact, if you've seen some of our recent announcements, we're actually investing more dollars in that part of the business. We mentioned the Edmonton rail project and a few other ones. So midstream assets are strategic to us. We think we're getting full value for them as part of the integrated business model that we have, but I wouldn't want you to ever think that we're not aware of and looking at everything that's out there that others are doing and some things others may not have thought about yet.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I guess, maybe come back a little bit on the Permian question, just because we did see the -- I believe there was an asset swap that you did during the quarter. And since in general we're seeing a lot more activity heading that direction, maybe could you give us an idea, a little bit of sort of relative size? I know you don't like to get into a lot of details, but kind of relative size; and as we think about growth opportunities maybe of the Permian relative to the identified projects in the Gulf of Mexico, if there's any sort of, I don't know, additional detail, clarity, something there you could offer us?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes. We did sign an agreement in the second quarter to do a swap that basically added about -- additional 26,000 net acres in the Permian. And virtually all of it, it was in the Midland basin, which of course, as you know, is prospective for the horizontal drilling that we talked about. If you add that to the acreage we talked about that we picked up earlier this year, we've now added 50,000, 60,000 prime acres right in the sweet spot of where we want to be. So that's good. And that's one of the reasons why we've increased rigs in that area. I mentioned the 65 workover rigs that we're running. And I think we've got 11 rigs running on the exploration and delineation and evaluation side, so certainly ramping up activity there and very encouraged by the results we're seeing. It's a very, very active area for us. Now in terms of activity relative to other areas, I have to also say the Bakken has -- is an area where we're also ramping up production quite significantly, and you see that in our results. We've got a lot of activity there. We've got 12 rigs running. That's up from where we've been in the past. Operated production was up 26% in the second quarter. So again, we're continuing to ramp up. The other play we've talked about is the Ardmore, and we've got higher rigs running there as well. One of the things, if I just kind of think about adding all of that up and looking at our liquids plays, production across the Permian, Bakken and Woodford Ardmore in the second quarter was over 200,000 barrels a day. And that was up about over 25% from a year ago and up quarter-to-quarter. So we're continuing to work that. Comparing those opportunities to the Gulf of Mexico, we're fortunate that we've got opportunities in both of those areas. We do have major projects coming on and starting up. I mentioned Lucius, which is the oil development there starting up before the end of the year. The gas piece of that project for us, Hadrian South, will also start up and bring on additional volumes. We continue to work on Julia, and that's progressing well. And then there are a couple of other projects that we also have an interest in. So that's coming through. We've also picked up some additional very attractive exploration acreage. Recently, we were awarded the 3 blocks that we were the high bidder on right over there on the trans-boundary area bordering up against Mexico. So we've got those 3 blocks awarded to us there in the gulf, and we're hoping that'll lead to some opportunities down the road beyond that. So both of those areas are looking good. The Gulf of Mexico never delivers 100% success rate to anybody, and we've drilled a couple of dry holes ourself. But if we step back and look across the last several years and what we've got on the plate going forward, we like what we have. And we're looking forward to getting these high-margin volumes up and running here later in the year.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And then it kind of segues into what my other question was going to be. Mexico, clearly, they've made progress on the legislative side. We still need to see what the actual rules are going to be and get a good feel for timing, but can you talk a little bit about what Exxon sees as the possibilities in Mexico over the next, oh, I don't know, 3 to 5 years as this develops?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Well, we're certainly encouraged by what we've seen to date. And we're certainly respectful of the process of deliberation that's going on and as they work through their legislative process, and we're monitoring that closely. We have a long history in Mexico, and we are certainly anxious to see how all this comes out and what opportunities might be available for us along those lines. Again, as I mentioned a minute ago, we do have those 3 blocks awarded to us right there on the boundary of the Mexican blocks in the deepwater gulf. And so we'll see if that can help generate opportunities, but we're encouraged today, anxiously awaiting the -- how all of that finalizes and all the details come out over time. And then we'll pursue any opportunities that are attractive to us, but we certainly like our position.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Terreson with ISI.", "Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "So for clarification, how does the $1.6 billion of Upstream asset sales that you mentioned a minute ago reconcile with the $1.2 billion other figure that you highlighted on Slide 8? And do you have any geographical segmentation for either of those results?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Sure. So if you're looking at the $1.2 billion that we mentioned, that was kind of the delta quarter-on-quarter, okay? And -- because we had a number of asset gains last quarter and then last year. So if you're looking at the total picture there, and again there are other items in the earnings rec, but just to be clear, in the Upstream, the total value of the asset sales in earnings was $1.6 billion in the quarter. And then if you look quarter-over-quarter, that's about $1.5 billion, with an offset of a couple of hundred million dollars in some other things like startup expenses and that sort of thing. If you're looking at the sequential comparison, we had about $400 million of gains on asset sales in the first quarter this year, so the delta there is about $1.2 billion in earnings. So I hope that sorts it out for you. And then we talked separately in the call about the impact on the cash flows.", "Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then secondly, over the years, ExxonMobil and its peers have employed fairly substantial portfolio management programs to support returns on capital. And with the decline in returns across the sector over the past 4, 5 years, the pace has accelerated for some companies and with positive effect on returns and their values in the market. So my question is, with ExxonMobil's returns following what the industry did over the last several years, why wouldn't the company be using portfolio strategies -- portfolio management more rather than the same, or less, to enhance its returns profile? That is, if you think that it's not. So really, any updated thinking on portfolio management strategy in light of the industry context is appreciated, David.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, yes, thanks, Doug. I would say there's really 2 items to talk about in return -- in regard to the return performance here over the last couple of years. First, with regard to asset sales, they're not linear. We had a number of asset sales in '11 and '12. And I think the combination of those 2 years yielded about $20 billion in cash flow, very strong. Last year was less of a year. This year, we're off to a pretty solid start between the first quarter and the second quarter and, in particular, what we've generated here with our asset sales. So the program is ongoing. We don't make an announcement in advance of what we're going to do. We find that gives us a little better negotiating strategy when we do actually sit down and talk about selling assets. So we don't have any stated objective. We don't have any target that we feel we must make, but we're certainly able to take advantage of anything in the market that gives us a chance to realize value for our shareholders. Fortunately, for us, we don't have to sell assets in order to make a dividend payment or another distribution because of the cash flow we generate. And again, reference back to that chart I showed you. I think one of the other things to keep in mind when you look at Upstream ROCE over the last few years, particularly in our case, and I can't speak for others. But one of the aspects of these very large legacy plateau-volume, nondeclining-volume projects, however you want to call them, is all the CapEx is upfront. And so there, as you're building these projects, and particularly in our case, I mean we talk about bringing on 1 million barrels oil-equivalent a day of production between '13 and '17. By definition, you've got a lot of steel in the ground to produce 1 million barrel of oil-equivalent a day. And until that capital starts up, that's nonproductive capital. So that, I think, at least for us, has been a big driver in terms of ROCE. And as you know, as those projects crank up, Papua New Guinea being a perfect example, you go from nonproductive capital in the ground to productive capital and, in this case, highly productive capital. So again, part of bringing all of these projects online, part of ramping up the production is the earnings, the cash flow and the ROCE that comes along with that. And then on the Downstream side, of course, we continue to have industry-leading returns and continue to make incremental investments there to at least maintain, if not increase, that advantage.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Dave, on Kearl phase 1, the ramp-up has been -- I think, probably is lower than what the investor has been expecting. From you guys standpoint internally, that -- when do you think all the startup issue will be fixed and then you will be running at a sustainable rate towards the full capacity? Is it going to take another year, 6 months? Any kind of rough time line that -- internally that you guys is forecasting?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, Paul, let me give you a quick update on Kearl, because we have seen a continued ramp-up in the production. I did -- I mentioned that in the second quarter although on the surface it looks like production was flat at about 66,000 barrels a day first quarter and second quarter. But recall we did have some planned maintenance there in April that took us way below that number. I can tell you, as we came out of that April downtime for maintenance, production picked up quite well. And in fact, we achieved record production in the month of June of almost 80,000 barrels a day. So we've not quite reached the lined-out production and our expectations, but we are making progress. A number of the issues that you are aware of are being resolved and we're working on that. Again, I have to stress that although we're certainly a little disappointed in the ramp-up over the last year from what our original expectation was, the technology is working fine. We've actually been able to run each of the 3 froth treatment trains above their designed capacity. That's very encouraging. And so the objective for us now is to get all 3 of them running simultaneously on a consistent basis at or above their designed capacity. And when we achieve that, that's when you really see that volume change. So we're encouraged at the capability of the assets that we've put in place. We're encouraged with the -- with how the technology is working. We are working on the ramp-up and look to improve that. I can't give you a specific date on which we'll achieve 110,000 barrels a day or some number greater than that, but we are making progress, and we're looking forward to continue that progress. I can also say, on the other side of the Kearl initial development, the expansion project is going very well. I'm pleased to say for another quarter that the project is on schedule and on budget, which on the backs of the Papua New Guinea LNG project, very unusual in our industry for somebody in my position to sit here on an earnings call and tell you the projects are on budget and on schedule. So acknowledged that the ramp-up in Kearl first phase hasn't been quite what we were expecting, but again want to confirm that we're making progress, and we're encouraged with the results we've seen so far this year.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Dave, you guys have some very decent success on the shale oil. Do you have a number you can share what is your total shale oil production in the second quarter average? And comparing to the full year 2013? And whether you can break it down between the black oil, condensate, NGL and gas?", "David S. Rosenthal", "I can't break down the split between oil, NGL and gas, but the numbers I gave just a minute ago on the call across the Permian, the Bakken and the Ardmore are pretty indicative of what we're doing. Although, not all of it in the Permian, as I mentioned, is unconventional oil. But I think, without a specific number, again, when you look at the numbers that we had in the supplement to the press release, you see the 38,000 barrels a day increase in U.S. liquids year-over-year. And we look at how things are going, again, in the big three, the Bakken, the Woodford Ardmore and the Permian, we're ramping up to that level that we talked about in the Analyst Meeting, and we continue to move forward. And I'll continue to give you an update on a quarterly basis.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Can I just sneak in a quick question, a final one? There's a article, I think, out there talking about Exxon is evaluating to have a major expansion in one of your Texas refinery. That seems to be very uncharacteristic or quite different than what Exxon historically has been building or their refining strategy in the U.S. I want to see whether you can comment on that.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Paul, the first thing I'd say is I'm not going to make a specific comment on any rumors or speculation that are out there in the press. We are regularly looking at our portfolio around the world. I mentioned the investment we're putting into the Antwerp plant, which you might say, \"Why would you be putting money into Europe given its current weak spot on the margin side?\" But again, that's consistent with our strategy of upgrading molecules, very nice project to take what is currently a low-value resid strain and upgrade it into very high-value diesel and other project -- and other products. So when we look at the U.S., when we look at Europe, when we look at Asia Pacific, we're always looking at opportunities, and what we can do to either upgrade any molecule that's flowing through our system, how we can take advantage of already-advantaged assets, like our refining circuit, and improve that. So the -- for us to be looking at many different things should not come as a surprise. But rather than mention anything specifically, and coming back to the strategy that we've articulated, I think I can really go back to what we said at the Analyst Meeting: You look at our Downstream strategy. It's all about expanding feedstock flexibility; increasing high product yields -- high-value product yields; reducing operating costs; taking advantage of logistics, like we're doing in Europe that I mentioned in my prepared remarks; or pressing even more of the value we get from integration. So I would say there's no change in that strategy per se but wouldn't comment on any specific item that you might have read in the press somewhere.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.", "Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "On Russia, I appreciate the point that the sanctions have not yet been fully clarified, but can you confirm whether the Arctic exploration prospect with Rosneft is still set to spud in August?", "David S. Rosenthal", "Pavel, I -- again, I can understand the interest in the question, but I really have to come back to what I said at the opening. Until we have a chance to look at the sanctions, read them, assess them, evaluating -- evaluate them, it just wouldn't be appropriate for me at this point this morning really to make any comments specifically on any of our activities.", "Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, understood. And then on the -- you guys recently applied for a approval for the Gulf Coast LNG export terminal with Qatar. Any sense of when you're expecting that approval to be given?", "David S. Rosenthal", "I don't have a specific expectation. I think one of the things that's helpful for us is we went in a pre-FERC filing process for a while. We've been working on this, so this isn't brand new for us. I don't know exactly what the expectation is in terms of approvals or a number you have to get from the FERC, of course, from the DOE, et cetera. But I think, if you -- if we kind of look across -- how this thing might progress through the approval process, and if we can get to a position where we can FID this, you might be looking at some time frame for production around 2019, again without breaking it into its components. But nice opportunity for us. And we are certainly looking forward to an efficient process in terms of getting everything approved and getting our DOE approval for export to non-FTA countries and moving on with that project. But it's just one of many LNG opportunities we have in the portfolio. We're fortunate to have a number of things we can be working on around the world in various points of development, and this one is certainly one that we're working on real closely.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Herrlin with Societe Generale.", "John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research", "Just a couple of quick ones, Dave. With the PNG gas, is that all contracted sales at this stage? Because you had some spot cargoes initially.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, we've been basically -- because the project has started up months early, the current cargoes that I talked about, they're basically, by definition, going in on a spot basis. And we're pleased with our ability to place those cargoes at attractive prices. As we get down to later on and the contracts all kick in, about 95% of the production is contracted on long-term contracts tied to the price of oil. And that is certainly part of -- if you'll recall, back at the Analyst Meeting when we said we would take the percentage of our total Upstream portfolio production from about 63% or 64% liquids or liquids linked up to about 69%. This is just an example of that, but yes, those -- the cargoes that we're placing now are basically spot but into the market. But again, we've been able to place them, and pleased with how that went and then really looking forward to getting this project continuing on. And again, just very pleased with the startup and very pleased that we were able to bring that project in under a budget that was 2 years old. The industry's gotten used to those annual updates of budgets on LNG projects and costs going up annually. And again, we're very pleased that -- to bring this thing in early and under our budget.", "John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research", "Last one for me is on your tax rate. Your effective tax rate was around -- maybe you said something, but I missed it.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, let me give you a little more color on that. You did see an effective tax rate around 41% or 42% or so. That is down from last year and also a little bit down from what we saw in the first quarter. The real impact you're seeing there is just a combination of the mix of our businesses, Upstream, Downstream, Chemical; geographic; some of our portfolio management activities; the expiry of the Abu Dhabi onshore concession. Of course, as is typical, asset sales tend to have a lower tax rate than earnings from your operations. So all of that kind of drove us a little low here in the second quarter. I can tell you, without giving a specific guidance and a specific number, but a normalized tax rate going forward ought to be somewhere in the mid 40s compared to upper 40s of prior history, somewhere in that order of magnitude, just to give you a feel for how that impact might roll through going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Guy Baber with Simmons Investment Bank.", "Guy A. Baber - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Just one quick one for me and more of a point of clarification. But I wanted to ask about the U.S. liquids performance relative to your internal expectations. That's an area that's outperformed our model. You've given us some great detail on the call, so thanks for that. But wasn't sure if you'd said that the U.S. liquids production was tracking in line with the internal plan or it was outperforming? So just wanted to clarify there, as we try to think through the ultimate potential of your LRS portfolio in light of some of the longer-term guidance you gave at the Analyst Day previously.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Yes, Guy, thanks for the opportunity to clarify that a little bit. We are slightly ahead of our internal expectations for the year in the U.S. on liquids. I mentioned, in total, relative to what we talked about at the Analyst Meeting, we're kind of spot on, so -- but the puts and takes, kind of think of -- about it as still maybe a little bit behind on the Kearl ramp-up, but I addressed that earlier, but slightly ahead in the lower 48. We are very encouraged with the results we're seeing. We're very pleased with the additional opportunities. We are adding rigs. We are putting some additional resources into those areas. But bottom line, to answer your question, yes, we're a little bit ahead of where we even thought we'd be internally so far this year.", "Operator", "And our last question comes from Allen Good with Morningstar.", "Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Just quickly, and I'm sorry if I missed it, but on the U.S. natural gas production, it looks like declines have been slowing over the past few quarters. This quarter, we actually saw sequential growth. Can you talk a little bit behind the moves there and what we may expect for the rest of the year and maybe into next year as well?", "David S. Rosenthal", "If we look at the gas business, yes, we're sequentially up just a hair but really about flat, down year-on-year, which is also consistent with what we talked about at the Analyst Meeting. So you are seeing that kind of year-on-year decline as we move those resources more into the liquid side. If we're looking sequentially, I wouldn't read too much into that. We are about flat. It's probably just timing of frac-ing and completions and bringing wells on to sale. I would say kind of as a follow-up to the prior question, everything we're doing on the gas side is per the plan, and that's a broad statement as well as in the U.S. So the second quarter, we had some good performance, but again, I wouldn't want to give an indication that our full year outlook on the gas side is any different than what we might have said at the Analyst Meeting. We are seeing the bump up, of course, from the early startup of PNG, but then on the other hand, we came out of a very warm winter in Europe and those volumes were down fairly significantly. So I think what I would just say to wrap up your question and the call: Think about all the things we laid out for you in -- at the Analyst Meeting, both strategically and the strategic choices we're making; and upgrading our portfolio, high-value, higher-margin, higher-unit-profit products into the market, that's across all of our businesses; selective investments to continue to press those strategic advantages. And then zeroing in on Upstream production volumes, right on what we had expected and maybe a little better in a couple areas. And again, if you look at that year-to-date free cash flow chart and you look at the progress we've made in a number of areas, we're -- again, we're very pleased with how our first half is turning out so far this year.", "Operator", "And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. Mr. Rosenthal, I'll turn the conference back to you for closing remarks.", "David S. Rosenthal", "Well, I would just like to thank everybody for participating on the call today and your questions, and look forward to talking with you all again in about 3 months.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil\u2019s third quarter earnings call. The focus of this call is ExxonMobil\u2019s financial and operating results for the quarter. And I\u2019ll refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website.", "Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statements shown on Slide 2.", "Turning now to Slide 3, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines from our third quarter and year-to-date performance. First, ExxonMobil\u2019s financial results reflect the strength of the integrated business model, which creates unique competitive advantages and allows us to generate long-term shareholder value regardless of market fluctuations over the business cycle.", "Second year-to-date cash flow from operations and asset sales fully covered our net investments in the business and robust shareholder distributions. And third, we continue to meet our operational and projective development objectives. Upstream production volumes for 2014 remain on track to average 4 million oil-equivalent barrels per day by year end, as the company delivers new production from project start-ups and work programs. All of which are enhancing our financial performance.", "Now moving to slide 4, we provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global economy showed mixed results in the third quarter. In the U.S., the economy continued to expand at a moderate pace, however China\u2019s economic growth tapered slightly, while the European economy showed further sign of weakness.", "As you know crude oil prices decreased sharply and Henry Hub gas prices also weakened. The WTI spread to brand, narrowed whereas global industry refining margins were essentially flat as stronger European margins were offset by weaker margins in the U.S. And finally, chemical commodity and specialty margins strengthened during the quarter.", "Turning now to the financial results shown on slide 5. ExxonMobil\u2019s third quarter earnings were $8.1 billion or $1.89 per share. Corporation distributed $5.9 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and our share repurchase program. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding, were $3 billion.", "CapEx was 9.8 billion in the quarter and just over $28 billion year-to-date, down 14% when compared to the first 9 months of 2013. Cash flow from operations in asset sales were $12.5 billion and at the end of the quarter cash totaled $5 billion and debt was just shy of $22 billion.", "Next slide provides additional detail on third quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter, cash decreased by $1.3 billion from 6.3 billion to $5 billion. Earnings, depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items in our ongoing asset management program, yielded $12.5 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales.", "Uses included net investments in the business, of $7.9 billion, and our shareholder distributions of $5.9 billion. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding\u2019s are expecting to continue at $3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014.", "Now moving to slide 7 and a review of our segmented results. ExxonMobil\u2019s third quarter earnings of $8.1 billion, increased by $200 million from the third quarter of 2013 as you can see higher downstream, and chemical margins were partly offset by lower upstream liquids realizations and higher corporate and financing expenses.", "In the sequential quarter comparison shown on slide 8, earnings decreased by $710 million. Lower gains on upstream asset sales were partially offset by higher downstream and chemical earnings. Our guidance for corporate and financing expenses remains at $500 million to $700 million per quarter.", "Turning now to the upstream financial operating results starting on slide 9. Upstream earnings in the third quarter were $6.4 billion, a decrease of $297 million versus the third quarter of 2013. Realizations decreased earnings by $670 million driven by lower liquid prices, and in this regard on a worldwide basis, crude oil realizations decreased by $10.48 per barrel. And worldwide natural gas realizations decreased by $0.42 per thousand cubic feet, as lower European realizations were partly offset by higher U.S. gas prices.", "Notably, favorable sales mix effects increased earnings by $340 million. Higher margin, production growth in Papua New Guinea, Angola, and North America as well as the net over lift, were partly offset by higher planned maintenance activities, lower entitlements and fuel decline.", "Moving to slide 10, excluding the impact of the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry, our oil equivalent production decreased by 1% compared to the third quarter of last year.", "Importantly liquid\u2019s production was up 14,000 barrels per day, increased production from onshore U.S. work programs, Canada and Angola were partly offset by divestment in tax in Iraq and Canada as well as scheduled maintenance in U.S., Nigeria and Russia.", "Natural gas production was down 319 million cubic feet per day as expected field decline in the U.S. and unfavorable entitlement impacts from pipeline gas in Qatar were partly offset by new high margin production from Papua New Guinea LNG.", "In short our volumes performance demonstrates the progress being made to high grade our portfolio mix with higher margin liquids and liquids linked gas production. As previously indicated we remain on track to produce 4 million oil-equivalent barrels per day in 2014.", "Turning now, to sequential comparison starting on slide 11, our upstream earnings decreased $1.5 billion dollars versus the second quarter. Realizations reduced earnings by $850 million with worldwide crude realizations down $7.29 per barrel and natural gas realizations down to $0.56 per 1000 cubic feet.", "Again, favorable sales mix effects, increased earnings by $460 million reflecting profitable growth in Papua New Guinea, Angola and Canada and a net overlift partially offset by lower seasonal demand in Europe.", "All other items reduced earnings by $1.1 billion primarily driven by the absence of the prior quarter Hong Kong power divestment gain. Upstream after tax per earnings per barrel were $18.65 excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes.", "Moving on to slide 12, volumes were essentially flat versus the second quarter. However liquids production was up 17,000 barrels per day due to growth in Angola and U.S. partly offset by higher planned maintenance in the U.S., Nigeria and Russia. Natural gas volumes were down 155 million cubic feet per day reflecting lower seasonal demand in Europe partly offset by a full quarter of Papua New Guinea LNG volumes.", "Moving now to the downstream financial, and operating results starting on slide 13, downstream earnings for the quarter, over $1 billion, up $432 million from the third quarter of 2013. Higher refining margins increased earnings by $820 million whereas volume and mix effects added another $100 million. All other items decreased earnings by $490 million which mainly due to unfavorable foreign exchange impacts.", "Turning to slide 14, sequentially third quarter downstream earning increased by $313 million, higher non-used refining margins increased earnings by $310 million positive volume and mix effects due to lower maintenance were offset by unfavorable foreign exchange and another effects.", "Moving now to Chemical financial and operating results shown on slide 15, third quarter chemical earnings were $1.2 billion up a $175 million versus the prior year quarter mainly due to high commodity product margins. Positive volume and mix effects were more than offset by increased planned maintenance activities.", "Moving to slide 16, sequentially our Chemical earnings increased by $359 million due to higher commodity and specialty product margins.", "Moving now to an update on our year-to-date cash flow growth shown on slide 17, strong year-to-date cash flow from operations and asset sales of $41.5 billion more than covered the net $22 million invested in the business and $17.6 billion distributed to our shareholders. Mainly cash is used for other financing activities including debt reduction.", "Overall free cash flow of $19.4 billion represented increase of $12 billion compared to the same period in 2013. This year year-to-date free cash will growth, reflects our strong operational performance, ongoing asset management program and disciplined capital allocation.", "Turning now to slide 18, I\u2019d like to provide an update on project startups that will deliver profitable growth. We remain on track for a record startup year and planning to add 300,000 net-equivalent barrels per day of production capacity, that is indicative of the diversity of our resource base. We continue to demonstrate our world class project execution capabilities and have made significant progress during the year.", "For June, three major projects were started up as you know Papua New Guinea LNG came online a few months ahead of schedule and reached full capacity in July. In Angola, the CLOV reached full capacity in third quarter just a few months after first production and in Malaysia Damar started up in the first quarter.", "Recently, we achieved several additional project milestones. In Indonesia, the second well pad at the Banyu Urip project started up adding another 10,000 barrels per day of early production. Banyu Urip is now producing nearly 40,000 barrels per day.", "Construction of the central processing facilities as shown in picture is near complete and uploading offshore storage vessel which recently towed to its location for a final hookup. The project will reach full fuel capacity of 165,000 barrels per day in 2015.", "In Malaysia the tap is to enhance to oil recovering project which is the first large scale UR project in the country was completed. Project is utilizing a water alternating gas injection process to sweep remaining oil reserves to producing wells, increasing overall recovery.", "Also, the Qatargas II maintenance project was completed, enabling the venture to maintain 10 million tons of annual LNG production for the years to come. Project added well capacity a new onshore facilities for sulfur handling.", "In the fourth quarter we also expect to start up several additional major projects closing out our 2014 plans. In our offshore Sakhalin project in Russia, the first production well at Arkutun-Dagi is currently being drilled, offshore facility hook up and commissioning activities are nearing completion following the installation of platform top size this summer. Startup is anticipated around year-end and the field is expected at add 90,000 barrels of oil per day at peak production.", "In the Gulf of Mexico hook up and commissioning activities for both the Hadrian South and Lucius developments are underway. At Hadrian South we finished drilling the two subsea wells earlier this year. And installation of the subsea facilities for tieback to the Lucius far is now complete. Startup of both projects is expected before year-end.", "In Canada the Cold Lake Nabiye project is moving into the final stages of completion. Hydro testing and commissioning activities are occurring in support of plant startup and steam injection is expected around the end of the year. This project will add another 40,000 barrels per day to Cold Lake production.", "I would now like to turn to slide 19 for an update on U.S. onshore liquids growth; we are generating significant cash flow by growing high margin liquids production in the U.S. primarily in unconventional place.", "In the Bakken our resource base is now approaching 1 billion oil crude and barrels and gross operated production is up more than six fold since we first entered the play in 2008. The Bakkan remains our most active conventional play and is the liquids growth engine in U.S. Gross operated production has increased 38% year-on-year reflecting higher activity levels. Currently running 13 rigs up from 10 in the third quarter of 2013, net increase, new wells brought online by 25% year-on-year.", "We continue to achieve strong results and increased efficiencies through our development drilling in the core areas. Optimizing completions and leveraging pad development, in this regard drilling and completion costs have been reduced by 25% since 2011. We also successfully employed our proprietary extract technology to reduce costs by eliminating the need for multiple plugs, normally required for fracking.", "In the Woodford shale, we\u2019re running 10 rigs, gross operated oil equivalent production in the liquids rich Ardmore Marietta area has increased by 25% year-on-year, driven my more completions, strong well performance and the move to pad development.", "Year two, well completion times have decreased significantly, reducing costs and increasing the number of wells drilled per rig year. Although rig counts have remained basically flat, we have increased the number of new wells by 33% year-on-year.", "In 2014, we also increased drilling activity in the Marietta basin, timed with the completion of infrastructure there. We\u2019re encouraged by the initial work in Marietta, which has an even higher proportion of liquids in the Ardmore area.", "And lastly 8% year-on-year on a large legacy production base reflecting tripling the number of rigs we had in the third quarter of 2013, along with approximately six conventional productions. We continuously look for opportunities to add attractive acreage 4,000 net acres in the heart of the expanding Wolfcamp play, as shown on the map in blue.", "Turning now to slide 20 for an update on our exploration activities. In Romania, drilling activities at Domino-2 are complete; the well was drilled to gather more information on the 2012 Domino discovery to assess the size of the resource and its commerciality. Domino-2 is being followed by the Pelican South-1 wildcat, which is currently being drilled. Additional exploration targets are also planned.", "In Tanzania, Statoil and ExxonMobil made a seventh discovery in block 2. Giligiliani-1 well discovered gas in the western part of block 2. The well confirmed an additional trillion cubic feet of gas in place, bringing the total estimated resource in place up to 21 trillion cubic feet.", "In Argentina, drilling and testing continue in the Vaca Muerta, where we have drilled and successfully tested 2 ExxonMobil operated horizontal wells. The Bajo del Choique X-2 well flowed at an average initial rate of 770 barrels of oil per day, and is currently on the long-term test. And I\u2019ll note that this is the highest unconventional oil production rate test in Argentina.", "The La Invernada X-3 well began testing at September with encouraging initial results, although still clinging up. Our active program continues with additional drilling and testing later this year and into 2015.", "And finally, in Russia, we successfully drilled the University-1 well in the Kara Sea. I can confirm that the well did encounter hydrocarbons, however results are under evaluation, it would be premature to comment any further at this time. Well was safely plugged and abandoned and the rig has departed to location.", "So in conclusion, today\u2019s presentation provides a summary of our year-to-date performance, ExxonMobil\u2019s strong financial operating results, demonstrate the value of our integrated business model and unique competitive advantages.", "Total earnings were $26 billion, reflecting solid operating performance across all of our businesses and our ongoing asset management program. And the upstream production of 3.9 million, oil-equivalent barrels per day remain in line with our plan as we add new production from project start-ups and work programs.", "We continue to improve our production mix with unit profitability increasing from $18 per barrel in 2013 to just over $21 per barrel year-to-date. A strong operating results combine with our disciplined capital allocation approach, generate a robust free cash flow of $19.4 billion, an increase of $12 billion compared to the same period in 2013. This favorable performance enabled us to maintain industry leading, shareholder distributions at $17.6 billion.", "That concludes my prepared remarks, and now we\u2019d be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you Mr. Woodbury [Operator Instructions]. And we\u2019ll first go to Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse.", "Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Yes, and may I say welcome on behalf of [Indiscernible] to the new role.", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Thank you Ed.", "Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse", "So obviously your net income margins probably surprised most people, they seem to go up as the oil price pulled back. You\u2019ve got new projects obviously coming on-stream, and I can see that your exploration expense was a little bit low, which is kind of non-cash. But can you give us some color as to why you think net income per barrel went up in the U.S. and international? Little surprised.", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Yeah, I mean we broadly say Ed that it starts with the integrated business model. You\u2019re all very aware that we\u2019ve got a very cyclical nature of our business, and our business model is focused on creating shareholder value by participating through that whole value chain. So it provides robust earnings performance despite the cyclical nature. If you think about just the overall upstream unit performance, as I said, we\u2019re up year-to-date versus 2013, by about $3 per barrel.", "Half of that is asset management impacts, another half improved profitability, primarily due to improved liquids mix as well as higher profitability around our gas projects, really good progress by the organization, in improving the higher margin production, as I said in the presentation.", "Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay and a second unrelated question just around Kearl, I mean obviously that is a big project and there is the Kearl expansion and potential de-bottlenecking maybe just give us an update of the latest status, and a bit more detail there, thank you.", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Sure, thanks for that Ed. Kearl, as we\u2019ve said many times, is a long life asset, it\u2019s advantaged. Obviously it\u2019s advantaged because of the prior technology that we\u2019ve implemented where it foregoes the need for an upgrade. Overall, I\u2019d say that we\u2019re making progress quarter-on-quarter on Kearl.", "Currently we\u2019re consistently producing over 100,000 barrels of oil per day, as we ramp up production there; we\u2019re clearly identifying opportunities where we can further enhance the facility reliability. I will say that we did take a turnaround in September, for planned maintenance, and all of these learning\u2019s are being fully integrated into the expansion project.", "As you know, we talked about the importance of capturing the learning\u2019s from the initial development, and that was a key element of their investment decision to progress right into the expansion. Likewise as we get more and more comfort with the operability of the initial development, those learning\u2019s are being integrated in the expanse project as well.", "So overall, we\u2019re really pleased with the asset, as I said; it\u2019s a long life asset that\u2019s going to provide very stable productions. And quite frankly Ed, we\u2019re in our sweet spot right now, we have \u2013 this is what we do very, very well in terms of our project execution, and then optimizing our operations to make sure that we maximize the value \u2013", "Operator", "Thank you. We\u2019ll now go to Phil Gresh, JPMorgan.", "Phil Gresh \u2013 JPMorgan", "Hey good morning.", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Good morning Phil.", "Phil Gresh \u2013 JPMorgan", "Just kind of following up on the question about the margin lift in the quarter and past couple of quarters, just kind of wondering how you would think about, how we should think about the next year or so. And what\u2019s the potential benefit you could see, in particular from cost levers. As we\u2019ve seen the oil price come down, what leverage do you think you can pull around cost and/or CapEx?", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Yeah Phil that\u2019s a great question, I mean clearly the market has seen some changes with prices. I don\u2019t think any of us should be surprised given the oversupply and continued economic weakness. I\u2019ll go right back Phil, toward the value of our integrated business model, which really does position us well to capture shareholder value; it is the cyclical nature of the business. Quite frankly the market controls the price, and what we need to focus on are the variables that we do control.", "And to your question, those include things like effectively managing our development and operating costs, maximizing our reliability, and then optimizing the value of the molecules through the integrated business model. All along that, that has been a fundamental main stay of our corporation. And then as a key element of how we manage that, and it\u2019s always around optimizing that the cost structure within our assets that we are maximizing the value from the resources.", "Phil Gresh \u2013 JPMorgan", "And just as a clarification could you tell us how much of the 2015 CapEx is locked in at this point, what kind of flexibility you have?", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Yeah, so just a little bit more about the CapEx, if I could step back a moment, as you all know our CapEx has grown through years, and it peaked in 2013 at about $42.5 billion. And that was largely driven by a deliberate decision to progress several high value upstream research projects, upstream resource projects that were ready and matured to move forward. And now we\u2019re trailing down to what I consider a more of a normal spin pattern of just shy of $37 billion.", "Now the upstream has dropped off a little bit more than the down \u2013 it\u2019s dropping off little more than that as the downstream in chemical are increasing their spend pattern. But you can appreciate a lot of these projects that are in current progress, that if that CapEx profile will continue into the future. Our guidance is no different Phil, in terms of about just shy of $37 billion a year for the next couple, and we continue to invest to the cyclical nature of our business.", "Phil Gresh \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay. And then my second question would be, you obviously have a very strong balance sheet and stronger free cash flow generation, arguably stronger than most of your peers. So you\u2019re in a pretty unique position to be potentially more aggressive in this period of weaker oil prices. So maybe you could comment about how you would think about that bigger picture, whether it\u2019s the buyback program or opportunities with the portfolio?", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Yeah Phil, I would tell you, I think you assess it up pretty good, clearly the financial flexibility we have with our current debt levels in our triple credit rating position us very well to respond to potential investment opportunities, whether that be additional resource developments, investment in our downstream or chemical business that provide us advantaged benefits to the industry. It really requires us to be able to maintain a very disciplined approach to capital allocation through the business cycle, while at the same time providing industry leading shareholder distributions.", "So if you think about our capital allocation approach, it\u2019s first and foremost, invest in all of our attractive business opportunities that are accretive to average unit profitability and returns. Second is to continue to pay our reliable and growing dividends, and I\u2019ll remind everybody that our dividends have grown about 10% a year over the last 10 years. And then lastly is, to return the cash to our shareholders through our share buyback program.", "As we\u2019ve said in the past, our operating cash flows remain the primary source of funding for both of our capital requirements and our shareholder distributions. But we\u2019ll access the financial markets when and if needed to meet commitments or capture opportunities.", "Operator", "Thank you. And we\u2019ll now hear from Doug Terreson, ISI.", "Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI", "Good morning Jeff.", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Good morning Doug.", "Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI", "So my question, regards to margin and profitability improvement as well. And you covered the mix of effects on new projects in \u2013 Abu Dhabi but you also mentioned asset management. So my question is whether these benefits that you guys are getting from asset management or of the strategic or operational variety. And so just some clarification on what you mean by that?", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Yeah so as you know asset management has been a core component of how we manage our business. We\u2019re constantly looking across the portfolio to assess how we could maximize the value of our assets, either through development or finding alternative means to go ahead and monetize those assets. So as a result, as you know, we have, had a very healthy program in terms of our divestment activities. In terms of our unit profitability, as I said year-on-year 2013, 2014-2013 the part of that increase in unit profitability was associated with our asset management efforts.", "By the way the example Doug, let me just remind you over the last 10 years, for instance, in our downstream we have reduced our refining capacity by more than 1 million barrels a day. Associated with divestment of about 20 plus refineries, we\u2019ve divested over 200 fuel terminals, 38 blending plants and 6000 miles of pipeline. So it\u2019s a very active program to make sure that we\u2019re maximizing the value to shareholder, but also positioning us strategically to continue to perform at an industry leading pace in the future.", "Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI", "Let me ask you one other question about this. So the company\u2019s always done really well optimizing cost, but has there been, and has always been, a pressure on your cost for that reason but, is there a, maybe a step up in the effort to deliver sustained cost improvements that also may be affecting the results over the last few quarters?", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "We always focus on cost management, our cost structure Doug. I\u2019d tell you that regardless of where we are in the business cycle, that is a fundamental part of our D&A is, how do we become even more efficient than we\u2019ve had historically? And that\u2019s not only through the highly qualified people we have working here at ExxonMobil but also the application, the technologies that we have in order to position ourselves in a, even a more effective manner to increase the value of those molecules.", "Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll now go to Evan Calio, Morgan Stanley.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Hey good morning Jeff.", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Good morning Evan.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Yeah, this is somewhat related to the cash flow question and discipline. What drives you to forward the 4Q buyback guidance at 3 billion, given the sequential commodity price drop or seasonality refining and that should do cash in 3Q and maybe in general what would commodity price do you need to slow the fly wheel or buyback or what the balance sheet, just kind of underwrite that through any potential downturn?", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Evan, I would fall back on what I indicated previously on our capital allocation approach. It\u2019s a decision that we manage internally around, whether our cash requirements in order to invest in the opportunities that we have in our portfolio. Its making sure that we continue to return cash to our shareholders through the dividend. And then we make a unique decision internally around how much additional cash are we to go ahead and distribute to our shareholders \u2013 stock buyback program.", "Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "At this moment it\u2019s a quarterly-by-quarterly assessments in those kind of an up and down overtime. Is that how it\u2019s approached?", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Yeah Evan I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably much more continual than that, but generally speaking there is, if you will, a decisive point on each quarter to decide what we\u2019re going to do in the next \u2013 near future.", "Operator", "And moving on we\u2019ll hear from Asit Sen, Cowen and Company.", "Asit Sen \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Thanks and good morning.", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Good morning Asit.", "Asit Sen \u2013 Cowen and Company", "So two unrelated questions, first thanks for the color on U.S. onshore liquids, but wondering if you could quantify your production during the quarter if you could from U.S. and conventional.", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Yeah, you bet Asit. Let me just share with you, the largest part of our unconventional U.S. liquids growth is in the Permian, Bakken and Woodford. And in total those are producing in excess of $210,000 barrels a day now. And as I said in my prepared comments it is, it has really been a significant progress over the last several quarters. I\u2019d give you a little more color to that by saying that about 40% of that is in the Bakken, 35% in the Permian and the rest is in the Woodford. Great progress, I couldn\u2019t be more proud of the folks there at XTO and the success they\u2019ve had here in the recent past.", "Asit Sen \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Thanks, very helpful. And second on LNG, could you comment on how global LNG pricing adjust to lower oil prices in comparison. There is a four to six month lag, but I wonder if you could comment on that?", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Yeah, I mean broadly speaking the specifics of our LNG commercial agreements are confidential, but let me use Papua New Guinea as an example a majority of the Papua New Guinea volumes are contracted in excess of 95%. They are linked to a crude price and as crude price varies, so does that LNG.", "Operator", "Thank you we\u2019ll now hear from Blake Fernandez, Howard Weil.", "Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil", "Good morning Jeff, thanks for taking the question. Over the past six months or so, you\u2019ve announced a couple of investments in the downstream in Europe, which seems a little bit countered to what we\u2019ve seen from peers. We\u2019re basically trying to reduce their capital employed in the area. And I\u2019m just curious if Exxon is maybe taking a different view on the macro longer-term. Or if it\u2019s a scenario where you feel you have superior assets where, over time maybe just capacity rationalization occurs. And you\u2019re last standing with an unattractive asset?", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Yeah. Blake thanks for the question and the interest in that area. Clearly we are stepping out and distinguishing ourselves, but let me step back just a little bit and talk about the European portfolio and then the downstream investments. I mean clearly Europe is disadvantaged by overcapacity. And some of which is driven by the lower cost feedstock in the U.S. and the Middle East. This sector will continue to rationalize existing capacity.", "ExxonMobil\u2019s European assets though are advantage versus our peers due to the more efficient operations. And the integration that we have with our chemicals and lubricants manufacturing businesses. So you\u2019ll see us continue to invest in the business cycle in order to enhance our advantage position. Now specific to those investments, they are always focused around key areas like lowering our raw material costs, increasing our higher value product yields, expanding logistics capability and flexibility.", "And then our main stay of reducing the operating cost structure. Ultimately to high grade the products to capture market demand. So if I focus specifically by way of example on the investment in the Antwerp delayed coker, that\u2019s around investing in conversion capacity to take lower product, lower yield product, such as the fuel oil and convert it to disciplined advantage where we have higher volume and more margins.", "Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil", "Thanks. I\u2019ll take one more if I could, you may not be able to answer this, but you mentioned the discovery in the Kara Sea which University-1. If I\u2019m not mistaken I\u2019ve read some press article suggesting that Rosneft may decide to pursue the additional drilling on their own due to the sanctions and what not. I\u2019m just kind of curious how that would unfold with regard to your relationship there. And participating in future interests?", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Right, well Blake thanks for the interest. Clearly this is an important area for the industry in total. And we certainly appreciate the interest. Let me first start off by just recognizing the success of the well, I mean we\u2019re extremely proud of what the organization has achieved in an extraordinarily remote arctic region, both from a logistics and a drilling perspective. The team successfully completed the well with the utmost concern for safety and the environment. And that really does speak to the strength and capability of the organization.", "As I said in my prepared comments, I can confirm that we encountered hydrocarbons, but this is a very large area. This acreage is over 31 million acres. We\u2019ve got one penetration in that, so it is premature to make any assessment or really say anymore at this point. We are currently evaluating results to assess the Woodford plants, we\u2019ll move forward on. I will remind you that ExxonMobil has a very longstanding and successful business in Russia, built on an affective and mutual beneficial relationship with the Russian partners.", "Operator", "Moving on we\u2019ll hear from Jason Gammel, Jefferies.", "Jason Gammel \u2013 Jefferies", "Thanks very much. Two questions for me Jeff. The first on the accelerated drilling onto North America, I know that Exxon is a company that will invest throughout the pricing cycle, but I was just wondering if the number of rigs that are being employed in this place is going to be affected by the change that we\u2019ve seen in pricing conditions just over the last several weeks. Essentially what level of onshore price would you need to see before you can perhaps start laying down rigs?", "And then the second question, one of your primary competitors, just this week, successfully IPO\u2019ed \u2013 MLP with pipeline assets. And there\u2019s evidently a pretty big value gap between what the stock market is willing to pay for those assets through MLP and an integrated oil stock. Have you considered any form of MLP type of transaction with your pipeline assets?", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Yeah, Jason thanks for those questions. Let me first start with the unconventional, as I said really good progress, I gave a lot of details about it, very proud of what the XTO organization is achieving up there. Let me say that, these near-term price fluctuations are not going to have an impact on our operational activities. We test all of our investments across a range of economic parameters including price. And I\u2019ll just say at a high level that our current drilling programs and inventory are fairly robust in this price environment.", "So we\u2019re very confident with the drilling activity as I indicated, we are picking up rigs, so that we can continue to progress our resource development activities. And it is a very significant part of our growth opportunity and importantly our improvement in overall profitability.", "More specifically on the master limited partnership question. I talked a little bit already about our asset management program that is a fundamental aspect of how we do our business. And it\u2019s around making sure that we\u2019re making the right choices there that are maximizing value for the shareholder. We have, through the course of that process; we have really divested or monetized all of our non-strategic assets. So we\u2019ve been doing a lot of work you\u2019re hearing some folks do today.", "The remaining assets that we\u2019ve got in place are very strategic to the integrated model that we have between the upstream, downstream or on chemical business. The MLPs are generally used as a financing mechanism to raise cash and fund business growth, as you know with our financial flexibility we have very low cost to capital. While I will never say no, I would tell you that just the cost benefit tradeoffs for MLPs running attractive for us given our low cost to capital.", "Jason Gammel \u2013 Jefferies", "Very helpful. Thanks Jeff.", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Thank you, Jason.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Roger Read. Wells Fargo.", "Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Hi good morning.", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Good morning Roger.", "Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Just maybe going along with that sort of capital allocation and other questions that have come on here. So CapEx plus or minus 37 billion, or maybe I should say minus 37 billion here going forward. You just made the comment, a lot of the non-strategic assets have impaired. If we do find ourselves in a, let\u2019s say $80 to $85 oil environment, between the share repurchase program at around 3 million a quarter, the CapEx at 37 billion. And maybe not as many assets left to sell, at least from a non-strategic or non-core standpoint. How do you balance all of that, what gives, is it CapEx that gets pulled back, is it the share repurchase or is the \u2013?", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "And I don\u2019t want you to walk away from this thinking that there won\u2019t be any other divestment opportunities, because it is a continual process. Think of it as an ongoing upgrade of our overall portfolio whereby we continue organic exploration, identify higher up value assets, we continue to high-grade our down streaming chemical facilities. So it\u2019s an ongoing process that will likely continue to yield periodically divestment opportunities,", "Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Okay thanks, and taking another look at your lower 48 unconventional opportunities and ranking those in terms of returns or growth plus returns to some of your other opportunities, how do they scale up, or maybe as you just said, what is your best return opportunity today and where they fit in relative to that?", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Yeah, I would tell you Roger that they all are very strong. There\u2019s a lot of variability even within a given resource area depending on where you are in the trend. And I would tell you that ExxonMobil has prime acreage in all three of the areas that I talked about, as well as some others. So we are very well positioned, and as you saw with the Permian basin, we continue to look for opportunities to high-grade the overall portfolio on those basins, so very strong inventory that we continue to high-grade and look for opportunities for progressing the investment opportunities in each one of those fields. So we would not expect any change in our operational plans, thank you Roger.", "Operator", "Moving on, we\u2019ll hear from Allen Good, Morningstar Investment Research.", "Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar Investment Research", "Good morning, just another follow-up question on the lower 48 unconventional, as you mentioned you\u2019ve been pretty active in Permian acquisitions. I just wonder what\u2019s Exxon\u2019s thought, as far as what\u2019s the right size Permian position that you eventually want to get to, to get that to scale. And is there a preference for Permian acquisitions to relative to Woodford and Bakken or is it just been a case of value?", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Yeah Allen, it\u2019s always a case of value for us. I wouldn\u2019t say that we are excluding any opportunity in the US or internationally. Now we have found a number of opportunities to high-grade the portfolio in the Permian recently, but we continue to keep very well alert to other opportunities that may come up. And maybe even with the current decrease in prices, we may have additional opportunities that we\u2019ll find they are complementary to our business and can increase our overall underlying value. And I would take that \u2013 I\u2019d extend that beyond the U.S., we\u2019ve leveraged the expertise within the U.S. unconventionals to position ourselves strategically for other unconventional opportunities globally.", "Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar Investment Research", "Great, thanks. And just one on the downstream, Exxon obviously has a very large downstream global footprint, can you give us any color on what you\u2019re seeing as far as the demand side, given the slide we\u2019ve seen in oil prices. And a lot of concern out there is, I\u2019m not saying on the supply side, but weak demand. I was just wondering if you\u2019ve seen any changes in the demand patterns of late, given the lower prices.", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Yeah, well I mean as I said in the presentation, we did some margin improvement, but generally demand has been fairly strong within the U.S., particularly in our chemical\u2019s business. But in Europe, Asia Pacific, demand has been down and that\u2019s really a function of building capacity faster than demand, as well as economic weakness. But you\u2019ve got to step back from a chemical\u2019s perspective, for instance, we\u2019re expecting demand to grow at 1.5% above GDP. And we\u2019re a long-term business where we invest for the long-term and it\u2019s all fundamental to energy outlook, and demand projections.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Cheng, Barclays.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays", "Hey Jeff, good morning.", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Good morning Paul.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays", "Well first, just want to add my welcome to the Investor Relations.", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Thank you Paul.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays", "Several quick questions, on the page 11 of your presentation, the other is a negative $1.1 billion comparing to the second quarter. In the second quarter there\u2019s about $1.6 billion of the other sales gain related to the Hong Kong power. And your exploration expanse is lower, so then maybe adding another 100 million, 150 million in earning. So that\u2019s about $300 million to $400 million of other benefits. Can you help us with that in terms of what that benefit may be, the nature?", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Yes, so you\u2019re looking at, Paul, the sequential earnings reconciliation?", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays", "That\u2019s correct.", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Yeah, so as I said in the presentation, that was down about $1.1 billion and I would, at a high level, say that its asset management is down about 1.3. It\u2019s a net effect of the absence of Hong Kong power as well as other acquisition activities that occurred during that period, as well as, I think you appropriately pointed out, that other operational items were positive by about $160 million, due to lower OpEx primarily in exploration as well as some minor for ex-benefits.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays", "So you\u2019re saying that there was a swing is 1.3, so that means we have about 300 million or so, sales gained in this quarter?", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Yes, that\u2019s correct.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll now hear from Ian Reid, BMO.", "Ian Reid \u2013 BMO", "Hi Jeff.", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Good morning Ian, how are you?", "Ian Reid \u2013 BMO", "Yeah, very good. Can I ask you a quick question about Papua New Guinea? Now you\u2019ve got the first part of the project, or at least phase 1, fully on-stream, what is your thinking about adding the third train, utilizing the additional gas which a joint venture has discovered in the region. And also, potentially processing third party gas or building another train to process third party gas. Can you just kind of outline Exxon\u2019s thinking about that?", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Sure Ian, thanks for bringing up Papua New Guinea because it\u2019s another very successful accomplishment for the organization. I would tell you that everything is on the table, in terms of what we do there. Obviously, first and foremost, is that in terms of our priorities is to make sure that we are very comfortable, the operating structure, as I said, started up early.", "We got up to peak production, is operating very, very well, the project team and operations organization has done a remarkable job there. You\u2019re aware that there\u2019s some \u2013 we maintain an active exploration program in Papua New Guinea. We have picked up some additional resource; there are some other exploration opportunities that we\u2019re considering.", "And I would tell you that the next step would be to consider \u2013 and has been under review, the economic viability for incremental trends, here at the LNG plant. It was designed in order to easily tie in additional trends, so we\u2019re very well positioned. And as you can appreciate, the incremental cost expand the PNG facilities is going to be much, much more competitive than other Greenfield site.", "So in summary I\u2019d say that we\u2019re very pleased with the resource, the overall potential and performance of Papua New Guinea. We\u2019ve got some additional resource out there with the successful P\u2019nyang discovery. And we\u2019re looking for opportunities to add to it, and that can come, either through additional resource development or, as you indicated, processing third party gas.", "Ian Reid \u2013 BMO", "Okay, thanks. And just one further thing, on the Russian sanctions, how is that affecting your Sakhalin developments, and also the LNG project which you\u2019re progressing with \u2013?", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Yeah, very good. I feel to mention that when we were talking \u2013", "Ian Reid \u2013 BMO", "[indiscernible] loss of PSE volume as result of rising oil prices can you provide some sensitivity on earned up there and how much production you get back if oil stays around $85?", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Well Jason, I don\u2019t have the specific numbers at the price that you stated but I would tell you that sequentially in our sequential earnings that there were some positive effects to, associated with PSE volumes. It was under 10,000 barrels per day, second quarter to third quarter.", "Ian Reid \u2013 BMO", "Got it ok that\u2019s all for me.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll now hear from Ryan Todd, Deutsche Bank.", "Ryan Todd \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "A question you already touched on CapEx and CapEx outlook a few times during the call but if we take step back and look a number of your European peers, there\u2019s been kind of a clear trend and may be for a variety of reasons, clear message and strong efforts towards capital constraint deferral of certain projects and free cash flow going forward from that point of view? It\u2019s been a bit more muted here in the U.S. may be how, if there\u2019s been a shift in your approach to project economics and relative returns and profitability as you, like your go forward portfolio and the potential of the constrain more CapEx or prices impacts there whatsoever?", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "We always are our ends are set well in advance as I said earlier our investment, full range of economic parameters including price so that we have the comfort, that we\u2019re going to end up regardless of the type of price fluctuations that we feel like the program is robust. Or any great business model is that we invest into these business cycles and we\u2019ve got the financial projects if we need some additional capital.", "Ryan Todd \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Specifically on Tanzania you guys have discovered enough lot of gas to date can you give us any thoughts in terms of timing, in terms of your expectations and go forward plans there?", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Yeah. So on Tanzania a very good progress between Statoil and ExxonMobil as I said certain gas discoveries, now over 21 TCF in place. There is a consortium that has come together they have evaluated potential sites for common onshore LNG facility and we have made plans on site location. Studies are progressing to determine the development it really is in really early stages and it\u2019s really too early to determine a specific startup date. Overall design capacity or even the capital investment, but fundamental for us environment is to ensure that an investment of this scale and complexity is to generate an acceptable return for our shareholders.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Good Morning, just to confirm me to \u2013 on this CapEx question we keep coming back to is an interesting number again to be clear about peak of CapEx in 2013. And then you said next year\u2019s interesting variation in your spending for example even in the latest quarter we had downstream in chemicals. And beyond that, beyond the 37 net CapEx in the longer term future given that you\u2019ve highlighted to the extent to which you reached to peak in 2013 as a function of recapitalizing the upstream?", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Right Paul, so as I said we grew up $42.5 million in 2013 and again I want to make the point that the resource opportunities that we had before us and the maturity of those and the confidence that we had that we would generate very favorable returns for our shareholders likewise it is a conscious decision to bring our upstream spending down to a normal spend pattern.", "And as we communicated in early this year in our Analyst meeting we were projecting not to pull down to just south of $37 billion over the 2015 to 2017 period. And yes there is this larger increase in the downstream and chemical business and that is focused on like I talked upon Antwerp focused on making strategic investments that are going to better advantage our downstream facilities, relative to industry such as the North America ethane cracker at Baytown.", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research", "Level of CapEx, what do you mean by that? How do you define that normal level?", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Well if look at the resources going forward Paul it\u2019s based on our judgment when those resources are going to be ready whether it be the definition of the resource, the definition of the development concept the regulatory or when we believe they are ready to move forward and we have an optimal development, that\u2019s really what I mean by normal looking at our portfolio as opposed to when we saw these really large projects that came to provision together that \u2013", "Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research", "And just coming back to the PSE question obviously if prices were to stay here you spoke about two Q3 obviously it is relatively minor oil price shift, at the moment you are guiding to $4.1 million barrels a day next year. I assume that you\u2019re continuing with the guidance like that in the Analyst meeting but the obvious expectation be that, that number would come in higher as a result of lower oil prices even though I know, there\u2019s a different coalition around economics but broadly speaking that would be what we should work towards, right?", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "I think Paul I would \u2013 in March at the Analyst meeting. Again we look at the range over a period of time it\u2019s going to drive what the prices do and we make our best judgment as to where we\u2019re going to fit in that in order to give you that guidance. So if you think about what we said back in Analyst meeting we said that we would grow from about $4 million barrels a day up to $4.3 million barrels a day.", "1 million oil-equivalent barrels a day by 2017. And doing so we are adding up the and I\u2019ll mind you that a large part of that 95% plus was liquids and liquids linked gas production. So it will change our production mix by about 64% liquids and liquids linked to just south of 70% in 2017. So in summary I\u2019d say our guidance on volumes is still consistent with what we shared with you in March. Thank You Paul.", "Operator", "Moving on we will hear from Alastair Syme, Citi.", "Alastair Syme \u2013 Citi", "Hi Jeff couple of very good questions, can you maybe highlight little bit about how much you\u2019re spending on the U.S. shale piece is that something you\u2019d be willing to \u2013 and secondly just picking up on the comment you made about Qatar", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "[indiscernible].", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Herrlin, Societe Generale.", "John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale", "Yeah, thank you. Most of the things been asked Jeff, but regarding the shale economic thresholds in North America with the Bakken, it sounded like you have a different kind of completion, it\u2019s not plug and perf, its somewhat different. Can you elaborate a little bit more, and also with that completion are you also doing similar thing in Argentina?", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Yeah, good question John. I would tell you that, as I said in my comments, the XTO expertise that we built up in the unconventionals is being leveraged globally. And we are continuing to grow our capability there. As I shared in my prepared comments the improvements that we\u2019ve seen, not only in reducing overall cost, but improving the productivity of, if you will, the manufacturing process of drilling these wells. But a key element of that has been the application of technology. And as I said in my prepared comments, one of the benefits that we\u2019ve used in Bakken has been this completion technology, which is proprietary ExxonMobil technology called the XFrac.", "And that allows us to avoid putting a whole bunch of plugs in the well and makes it a much more efficient and safer operation for completion installation. And to close on your question about Argentina, I\u2019d broaden that and say that, that all of these learning\u2019s and they\u2019re conventional to apply elsewhere within our portfolio. And once again its, it\u2019s just another leading performance in our capability, and that positions us very well to compete for resources.", "John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Thank you John.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll now hear from Guy Baber, Simmons & Company.", "Guy Baber \u2013 Simmons & Company", "Thanks very much for squeezing me in here. Two quick ones for me, first question around exploration, but generally speaking, can you just remind me what percentage of the total capital budget this year is allocated to exploration appraisal activity. And then optimally, where would you like to see that percentage longer-term, just to sustain the long-term opportunities that reserve maturation, but also how comfortable you maybe in flexing that down at any point in the cycle for any given year.", "So that\u2019s number one, just thoughts on the exploration budget. And then secondly, just if you could quickly talk about the balance sheet, but you mentioned your excess financial markets if need be and your net debt to total cap obviously low compared to most peers. But actually high, relative to where it\u2019s been at the last 10 year period. But could you just remind us of your target leverage ratios and framework also. And just where you\u2019re comfortable in taking the leverage?", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Yeah. Guy let me first with the second, after your first question about whether we would flex down our exploration. I would tell you that we are opportunity driven, we got \u2013 in the well, we\u2019ve got a very robust inventory. It\u2019s a \u2013 we\u2019re very well positioned to compete, as I said earlier, it\u2019s all around how do you upgrade the value of overall resource base. So from an expert, we have really got to be focused on the horizon around high grading our portfolio, specific to our budget, we don\u2019t break that type of information out in terms of risk. Components within the exploration budget, but I\u2019d like you to think about our exploration activity as a means to further high grade our overall portfolio.", "On the second point on our leverage ratio, there is no target. We\u2019ve been fairly consistent over the last couple of years. We\u2019ve maintained the triple A credit rating. I want you all to think about it, our focus is around value. It\u2019s not always \u2013 or not a focus around market share or volume, it\u2019s around value, how can we create greater value? And we\u2019ll use that balance sheet to achieve that objective when we think it\u2019s appropriate.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov, Raymond James.", "Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James", "Hey thanks very much. Just one more for me on Russia if I may, you touched on the policy sanctions related uncertainty on relation to the Archadeck. Are there any other uppered or reduced because of the sanction rules?", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Yeah, so you may recall a number of joint ventures throughout Russia, we talked about the Kara Sea. We also have a venture in the Black Sea and West Siberia, and then lastly, a number of ventures within the Russian arctic ship. And if you think about the sanctions, they deal with specifically deepwater, unconventional resources and arctic activity. So , the joint ventures I just summarized for you, are included within the scope of the sanctions.", "Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James", "So have all the activities in those JV\u2019s been suspended as a result?", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Well we have \u2013 we are fully complying with the sanctions and regulatory requirements.", "Operator", "And we do have one follow-up question from Paul Cheng, Barclays.", "Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays", "Hey Jeff \u2013 we need to know your investment in Europe refining. Do you have any plan to do a safe system? Second question, I think in your comments you were saying that you have a spec in the quarter, and also at the end of the third quarter from the inventory underneath or overneath. Thank you.", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Thank you Paul. On your first question around investments, I would just say broadly that we regularly evaluate our global portfolio where we have offered investment. As I\u2019ve already discussed, with areas targeting on things like expanding our feed logistics or reducing our cost structure. We have a lot of \u2013 and generally speaking Paul as a matter of practice we just don\u2019t want to comment or speculate on any particular opportunities or investments, maybe not be considering. When they\u2019re ready we will and we\u2019ve made a decision. We\u2019ll go ahead and ensure that more broadly.", "The second question was around over lift. And I\u2019ll just, if I can, I\u2019ll refer back to our quarter-on-quarter upstream earnings reconciliation. And if you remember there was a volume mix component about the positive $340 million. And first and foremost there was a fairly sizeable component associated with project, high margin project and program activity of over $500 million. And as I said during my prepared comments, it really highlights the progress that we\u2019re making on our unit profitability in the higher value volumes.", "Not for the sake of growing volumes, but for the sake of capturing value. There was an over lift component that was positive. And then there was an offsetting decrease in a number of various, such as entitlements, decline, downtime and some asset management.", "Operator", "That does conclude today\u2019s question and answer session. Mr., Woodbury at this time, I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.", "Jeffrey Woodbury", "Well to conclude, thank you all for your time and your interest this morning.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen good morning and welcome to ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our Web site.", "So before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2.", "Turning now to Slide 3, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines for first quarter performance. ExxonMobil delivered earnings of $4.9 billion. These solid financial results demonstrate the value of our integrated business in a lower commodity price environment. Regardless of our current market conditions we remain focused on business fundamentals and competitive advantages that create long-term shareholder value.", "Upstream production volumes were more than 2% higher compared to year ago quarter, benefiting from new developments in Papua New Guinea, Canada, Angola, Indonesia and U.S. onshore liquids plays. ExxonMobil's downstream and chemical businesses had strong performance across all regions driven by lower feedstock costs and improved demand, coupled with our competitive product and asset mix.", "Moving to Slide 4, we provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results, global economic growth continue to moderate in the first quarter of 2015. U.S. growth slowed relative to the fourth quarter where as China's economy decelerated further and growth in Europe and Japan remain weak. However there are recent indications that growth maybe improving particularly in Europe.", "As you know energy prices continued to decline in the quarter, leading the lower cost to supply in the downstream and stronger global refinery margins on hard demand. Meanwhile chemical gas cracking margins softened on lower product realizations but remain advantage relative to liquids cracking.", "Turning now to the financial results as shown on Slide 5. As indicated, ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings were $4.9 billion, which represents $1.17 per share. The corporation distributed $3.9 billion to shareholders in the quarter to dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding and of that total $1 billion, was used to purchase shares. CapEx was $7.7 billion which is in line with our plan. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $8.5 billion and at the end of the quarter cash totaled $5.2 billion and debt was $32.8 billion.", "The next slide provides additional detail on sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter, cash increased from $4.7 to $5.2 billion. Earnings adjust per depreciation expense changes in working capital and other items in our ongoing asset management program yielded $8.5 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Users included net investments in the business of $6.8 billion and shareholder distributions of $3.9 billion, debt and other financing increased cash by $2.7 billion.", "Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.73 per share a 5.8% increase from the last quarter. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to remain at $1 billion in the second quarter of 2015.", "Moving on to Slide 7 for a review of our segmented results, ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings of $4.9 billion were $4.2 billion, lower than the year ago quarter. Lower upstream earnings were partially offset by stronger downstream results. In the sequential quarter comparison, shown on Slide 8, earnings decreased by $1.6 billion, as lower upstream and chemical earnings were partly offset by stronger downstream results. Guidance on corporate and financing expenses remain at $500 million to $700 million per quarter.", "Turning now to upstream financial and operating results starting on Slide 9. Upstream earnings in the first quarter were $2.9 billion, down $4.9 billion from the first quarter of 2014. As you can see slightly lower realizations decreased earnings by $5.5 billion where crude declined by almost $54 per barrel and gas was down more than $2.60 per thousand cubic feet. Favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings $340 million, driven by growth from new developments. All other items added another $250 million primarily due to favorable tax effects.", "Moving now to Slide 10, oil equivalent production increased 97,000 barrels per day or 2.3% compared to the first quarter of last year. Liquids production increased to 129,000 barrels per day or 6%, benefitting from new projects, work programs and favorable entitlement impacts partly offset by maintenance activities. Natural gas production decreased to 188 million cubic feet per day or 1.6%. Field decline and divestment impacts were partly offset by volume adds for Papua New Guinea and LNG in higher entitlements.", "Turning now to the sequential comparison starting on Slide 11, upstream earnings were $2.6 billion lower than the fourth quarter. Realizations decreased earnings by $2.4 billion as crude declined almost $22 per barrel and gas decreased more than a $1.20 per thousand cubic feet. Favorable volume and mix effects improved earnings by $260 million driven by a higher LNG facility utilization, entitlement impacts and growth from new developments. All other items reduced earnings by $500 million reflecting lower benefits from tax items in absence of the Venezuela ICC award, partly offset by lower operating costs.", "Now moving to Slide 12, sequentially volumes were up 194,000 oil equivalent barrels per day or 4.8%. Liquids production increased 95,000 barrels per day, on new project growth and entitlement effects partly offset by fuel decline. Natural gas production was up $594 million cubic feet per day driven by stronger seasonal demand in Europe and higher LNG facility utilization partly offset by fuel decline.", "Moving now to the downstream financial and operating results starting on Slide 13. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $1.7 billion an increase of $854 million compared to the first quarter of 2014. Higher refining and marketing margins increased earnings by $1 billion, positive volume and mix effects added another $70 million and all other items decreased earnings by $260 million including higher maintenance activities and unfavorable foreign exchange effects.", "Now turning to Slide 14, sequentially first quarter downstream earnings were up $1.2 billion, stronger global refining margins increased earnings by $900 million while unfavorable volume and mix effects reduced earnings by $70 million. All other items added $340 million primarily from lower expenses and maintenance activities.", "Moving now to the chemical financial operating results starting on Slide15. First quarter chemical earnings were $982 million down $65 million versus the prior year quarter. Higher margins on lower feed stock and energy costs increased earnings by $240 million. Favorable volume and mix effects added another $30 million and all other items reduced earnings by $340 million mainly due to unfavorable foreign exchange effects.", "Moving now to Slide 16, sequentially chemical earnings decreased by $245 million on lower commodity product margins. Positive volume and mix effects were more than offset by other impacts.", "Moving next to the first quarter business highlights beginning on Slide 17. In our upstream business we continue to pursue attractive investments to commercialize our unparalleled resource base. As discussed during our recent analyst meeting 2015 will be yet another active year for new developments including seven major project start ups which will add another 300,000 barrels of oil per day to working interest capacity.", "We reached several milestones over the last few months starting in Canada first pitchman production was achieved from the Cold Lake, Nabiye expansion which was completed on schedule and on budget. Nabiye produced 12,000 barrels per day in March with volumes expected to increase to a peak of more than 40,000 barrels per day by year end. Over it's expected 30 year life span Nabiye will develop 280 million barrels of recoverable reserves. In the Gulf of Mexico we initiated production from the Hadrian South subsea development in late March. And I highlight that one of the Hadrian wells recently tested at 200 million cubic feet of gas per day representing one of the highest production rates on record in the Gulf of Mexico.", "Daily gross production from Hadrian South is expected to reach approximately 300 million cubic feet of gas and 3,000 barrels of liquids from two wells. In Angola block 15 we successfully started up Kizomba Satellites Phase 2 project notably ahead of schedule and below budget. This capital efficient project is a subsea development tied back to the existing Kisomba B and Mondo FPSOs and leverages available always for processing storage and off loading.", "Project development were 190 million barrels from three fields and gross production is expected to reach 70,000 barrels of oil per day helping to boost total block 15 production to 350,000 barrels per day. In Asia the Banyu Europe development is more than 96% complete in commissioning activities are well underway. The project's crude transport system which includes on shore and off shore pipelines connected to a floating storage and off loading vessel has been installed and first lifting in April.", "To implementation of early production concepts Banyu Europe is now producing 75,000 barrels of oil per day growth. Early strong well performance enables continued use of existing early production facilities along with the ramp up of the central processing plant. We expect to reach peak field production of more than 200,000 barrels per day by year-end.", "The Kearl expansion projects in Canada continues to progress ahead of schedule. All major construction activities are now complete and are focus has shifted to commissioning and pre-start up activities. Facilities start up is now expected by mid year. So with respect to our exploration program we continue to pursue a diverse set of opportunities. In Romania additional drilling is ongoing in the deep water Neptune block and data collected from these wells are being integrated into development planning for the area.", "Drilling operations in the Kurdistan region of Iraq are continuing and we drilled and tested the Pirmam well and are evaluating these results additional drilling is planned in the next several months.", "And then offshore Guyana, we are drilling the Liza wildcat which is the country's first deepwater well. Lastly in the Gulf of Mexico we were the apparent high bidder on 11 new exploration blocks in lease sale 235 further strengthening our acreage position. The plan to utilize our advance seismic imaging capability to enhance opportunity evaluation on these blocks.", "Turning now to Slide 18 and an update on our downstream investments which further strengthen our advantage portfolio. Here again during the quarter we achieved several milestones. We completed the lube basestock facility expansions at our refineries in Singapore and in Baytown Texas building on ExxonMobil's leading technology and our worldwide manufacturing footprint. These investments will help supply high performance lube basestocks to meet global demand growth.", "In Canada commissioning is underway at the Edmonton Rail Terminal a 50-50 joint venture in Imperial Oil and Kinder Morgan. The terminal will have a capacity of 210,000 barrels per day and will provide logistics flexibility to support efficient cost effective market access for our grown Canadian oils sands production. This facility will also enable us to deliver additional advantage crude to our refinery system. Ramp up of loading activities is expected over the next few months.", "Finally we also continue to extend our operating cost advantage by improving energy efficiency of our facilities. We have recently funded and started construction of a new 84 megawatt cogeneration plant at our Singapore refinery which will enable to shutdown of less efficient power generation facilities and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Upon start up the unit will add to our total 5.5 gigawatts of gross cogeneration capacity around the world. And this is another example of ExxonMobil's commitment to optimize manufacturing operations, improve energy efficiency and to reduce both environmental impacts and operating costs.", "So in conclusion ExxonMobil's results underscore our continued focus on business fundamentals and our competitive advantages regardless of market conditions. In the first quarter the corporation earned $4.9 billion demonstrating the value of our integrated businesses in a lower commodity price environment.", "In the upstream we increased production from new developments while in the downstream in chemical segments delivered strong results across all regions. Resulting cash flow from operations and asset sales were $8.5 billion generating positive free cash flow which highlights our disciplined capital allocation approach.", "Corporation distributed $3.9 billion to shareholders and we remain dedicated to creating shareholder value through the cycle.", "Now that concludes my prepared remarks and I would now be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you Mr. Woodbury. [Operator Instructions]. We will go to Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Doug Leggate", "I will try two if I may. The first one is on the, I wonder about expression the upstream capture rate specifically I'm looking at the very strong international gas prices this quarter, which seem to hold up a lot better relative to the oil benchmarks and I guess the mix significant of there are lot of moving parts obviously but the mix also saw you as gas production decline. So I'm wondering if you can just help those two specific issues on what\u2019s going on with the margin and whether you expect that strength to continue. And I've got a follow-up, please.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Doug we generally don't provide forward guidance on the commodity prices. In the first quarter our total gas realizations were about $6.11 and as you know that\u2019s a combination of our flowing gas as well as our LNG sales, and those LNG contracts have mixed fiscal terms that will in many cases are benchmark to liquid prices, obviously some type of lag affect associated with the market conditions.", "Doug Leggate", "So the strong European gases or international gas driver is really more of a lag effect, how should we think about it?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Well I think it from a LNG perspective, if you remember from our prior discussions it is a very significant part of our portfolio, and we've been adding significant liquids linked volumes over the years, and certainly is a factor for how our realization will change overtime.", "Doug Leggate", "I will maybe try and follow-up one offline to get into details. But my follow-up is maybe a little aspirational in terms of whether you will answer or not, but at our conference in November you -- and I guess multiple times since you guys have described Exxon as positioned for this type of environment, as it relates to M&A. Obviously we've seen one very large transaction already.", "I am just curious if you could kind of qualify how you see the market in light of that comment and specifically for the Mozambique LNG is on your radar given that you've held an advisory there with the government over in recent years, and I'll leave it at that.", "Jeff Woodbury", "As we've discussed previously think about it more broadly as asset management which is a key component of our ongoing business, and we regularly assess our portfolio for higher value opportunities throughout the cycle. And as you have seen in our financial results that includes an ongoing program of marketing assets where we believe they have greater value to others, but likewise we keep very alert to opportunities on the horizon per acquisitions, and that maybe bolt-on acquisitions as I said in the past that provide natural synergies to existing operations that we can capture incremental value from or larger acquisitions that fundamentally will provide strategic value for us in the long-term as you know, we're not going to signal specifics as to what our intentions are but we keep very much alert to maybe opportunities for additional shareholder value.", "I'll remind you that, given that financial strength that we have -- we can invest through our cycle, including in resource development opportunities, investments in our manufacturing business as well as potential acquisition targets.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.", "Neil Mehta", "On the quarter itself it looks like production was little higher than what we were expecting some of that was the PSEs but I think some of that was the underlying projects here. And as I think about Angola, Gulf of Mexico starting up, you've got some ramp towards the backend of the year as well. So I'm just curious as we think about the balance for the year, could there be some upside to the base case production guidance or are we not thinking about of the turnarounds. Anything you can do to provide some color on shape of production over the course of the year would be very helpful.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes, so just from a production standpoint, I'd tell you that our guidance that we provided in the analyst meeting last month remains the same about 4.1 million barrels per day. We started the year very strongly as you highlighted we added significant volumes with a quarter-over-quarter or sequentially associate with the new projects that we've brought on which as you appropriately pointed out or continue to ramp up. As I said in my prepared comments, we've got seven new major projects starting up throughout the year and this is part of our significant investment program that we had implemented several years ago that's where our CapEx peak up several years ago, as we wanted to progress these mature assets to capture long-term value and we're seeing the benefits of it today. Important in all that Neil is not only new projects but our continued focus on the base making sure that we've stronger liability and we're continue to integrate our learnings into productivity improvements.", "Neil Mehta", "And then if you could comment on two kind a top of minder news topical subjects here. The first would be any comments around Exxon Torrance and how we should be thinking about the ESP and timing there? And the second as relates to Russia, which I know you've spend lot of time and how we should be thinking about the impact assumptions on longer term growth from those operations?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Sure, Neil. On Torrance just to benefit of the group, the Torrance refinery in February experienced an incident which resulted in the damage to the electrostatic precipitator, and I'll say up front that we certainly do regret the incident and -- obviously going to be very diligent and understanding what the issues were what earnings we can take from it and how do we incorporate that into our global business?", "But this precipitator is a mission control device that removes fine particles from exhaust gas. There are several investigations underway both the state and federal level. Neil at this time, we really can't estimate when the investigations will be completed and when the site may return to full operations.", "As I indicated, we have our own investigation that's in progress. I'll say that we are diligently working to ensure a continued supply to our customers, some of the units at the refinery are operational and we're producing both gasoline and distillates, but we continue to evaluate in parallel with the investigations continue to evaluate options to reinstate our capacity there.", "With respect to Russia, broadly speaking there is really nothing new to report at this point as you know the sanctions remain in place and we will continue to fully comply -- I don't want to speculate when those sanctions will conclude but I'll remind you that they do not include or soften one operation which recently we're very pleased with the successful start of the third field our Arkutun-Dagi.", "And also say that we have had a longstanding and successful business in Russia that's really built on our effective and I think mutually beneficial rate relationship with our Russian partner. I guess the other point I'd leave you with is that we have a very diversified portfolio with Russia just being part of that and it provides great opportunities for us to continue to grow shareholder value over the years.", "Operator", "We will go next to Guy Baber with Simmons & Company.", "Guy Baber", "I was hoping you could discuss Kearl performance, a bit his quarter. It looks like some significant improvement relative to where it ran last year and if you get of actually approach max rate there for the quarter. So could you talk about what you're seeing there and then could you also address confidence levels in a quick sustainable ramp up for the Kearl expansion. I mean what that timeline looks like and some of the benefits of applying learning from some of the struggles with ramping up Kearl 1. ", "Jeff Woodbury", "I appreciate the question. As we've said in the past Kearl is an advantage long life asset, one that has significant future potential as you look at, how we further optimize the base. As you highlight we have continued to improve on our reliability towards our operating targets and we\u2019re fairly consistently producing at the 110,000 barrels a day growth. We are a bit short of that in the first quarter given some plant maintenance that we took but nonetheless it's important to say that we\u2019re achieving higher rates, we've implemented some facility enhancement opportunities, and we expect to see better reliability going forward.", "As I said in my prepared comments, the expansion is progressing ahead of schedule, when that expansion comes on we will get further economies of scale with the full operation. And as I have said previously we\u2019re fully integrating the learnings from the initial development into the expansion real-time such that we will expect to see better ramp up on the expansion versus the initial development.", "I would also highlight a couple of other things, first that we\u2019re making additional investments to maximize logistics flexibility and as I mentioned in my prepared comments the Edmonton Rail Terminal is going to provide additional flexibility. And that takes to my second point, that it really is fully integrated with our manufacturing business and we\u2019re capturing integration value throughout if you will the full value chain from upstream, downstream in our chemicals business.", "Guy Baber", "Also I was hoping to get a general comment on what you all are seeing on the capital spending front, when it comes to securing cost reductions and managing the CapEx according to the internal plan. It looks like it's tracking well to start the year from advantage point and more specifically the upstream non-U.S. spending was the lowest this quarter, it's been since 2009 I believe. So could you just talk about that a little bit, and is that just reflective of major project phasing or is there been perhaps some significant cuts to the international CapEx and areas that are little bit less visible perhaps to the base or elsewhere that you can talk about?", "Jeff Woodbury", "So let me take your first question in the broadest concept and as we talked previously regardless of where we\u2019re in the business cycle the organization stays very focused on driving down that cost structure whether it be in operating cost or a focus on capital efficiency in our major projects. Across our spend we\u2019re actively engaged with the various service providers and we\u2019re making some really good progress in capturing those savings from raw materials to services to our rig rates to our just fundamentally our construction costs.", "I will highlight just make a point that we have a very effective global procurement organization that is focused on capturing the lowest lifecycle cost, and I think it really does advantage us from managing that from a global perspective. I think it's also worth noting that our efforts go well beyond just trying to reduce cost from our service providers as we do think such as continuing to integrate our learning curve benefits into our designs and execution plans, I've shared with you in my response to prior question that real-time we've been able to integrate our learnings in the Kearl initial development into the expansion project.", "We continue to enhance our set of opportunities including through commercial terms as well optimizing our development plans and we continue to leverage what I'd say as the collective ingenuity between our service providers and our own people in identifying and pursuing more cost effective solutions.", "And I'll note that given our financial capability we\u2019re able to accelerate equipment and commodity purchases in the softer market, which I think provides a real cost advantage to our project portfolio. Today since the price decline I would say that the drilling and related services have been most responsive to the current market and we've captured about an incremental 20% reduction in our well cost from the lower 48 to unconventional place in terms of our spend level. I would tell you that there is no new guidance. We've signaled $34 billion target for 2015, we are making good progress and capturing the savings as I said that was incorporated into that spend level. But this organization tends to over perform and I expect that we'll see further savings beyond what we had envisioned.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.", "Evan Calio", "So over the macro maybe another aspirational question. Excellent touches more barrels than any U.S. producer any refiner for that matter. Any color on demand trends you are seeing or is there broadly any change or shift in the longer commodity down cycle view that was spoused at the spring Analyst Day?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Evan let me see if -- I just give you some thoughts on a broader picture. Currently we'll range in anywhere from the 1.5 to 2 million barrels a day over supply. General feeling is that as you get into the second half we'll see more conversions towards a balance supply demand. But as we all know there was a significant inventory build in 2014 due to the oversupply and that is continued year-to-date. And that storage will need -- that storage overhang will need to be or top overtime. ", "While we may converge in the second half of the year, I'd tell you that there is still a lot unknowns and one of them being is how the unconventional production levels in the U.S will trend over time despite the fact that we\u2019ve seen significant reductions in rig counts.", "Evan Calio", "My second question if I could on PNG, as Total finalizes development plan for its proposed second facility, I think it's this quarter. Is there a potential for Exxon to recover more costs or improve your overall PNG LNG economics with a bigger integration of the two projects or infrastructure?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Just broadly speaking and it's for a reason PNG Evan, because it really does spotlight the successful organization we have for our project execution in commercializing our resources. What a great success story with location that had limited infrastructure. The project was a significant feet for the organization in terms of being delivered on time and on budget, ramped up very quickly it's been held at design rates and we're just very pleased with the outcome.", "As you think beyond that ExxonMobil and its partners continue to assess additional resource opportunities. As you reflect on whether you can pull together enough resource in which to underpin a subsequent train that\u2019s part of what's being considered amongst the joint venture. I would tell you that will be the most cost effective option compared to another Greenfield development. Of course we are very well positioned there and we are open to options to try to reduce the overall cost structure for in general resource development was in Papua New Guinea.", "Evan Calio", "Given the economics, superior economics you had on the Greenfield facility I presume a Brownfield expansion would be relatively high kind of within the rankings at your relative potentially upstream projects.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes most definitely.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.", "Blake Fernandez", "I think you pretty adequately address Guy's question on the capital cost trend. But I was hoping you may elaborate a little bit more towards the operating cost side. Many of your peers have enacted hiring freezes and headcount reduction et cetera. And while I know we're not get a specific absolute dollar fig from you. I was just wondering if you could talk maybe about some trends we could expect to see on the operating cost side from just capital trends.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Sure, Blake I would tell you that comments what I made earlier were really reflective of both our operating costs and our capital costs. The point I would emphasize for you is that really regardless of whether we're in the high price cycle or in a lower price cycle that we're in right now. The organization has remained focused on the fundamentals. And you've heard us say before that we're price takers. And we really focus on those things that we control. And those things that we control are things such as cost, our reliability our productivity and it's how we structure the organization in the most efficient way.", "I'd tell you that we are very well positioned we never lose sight of those fundamentals, but we're also very well poised that when we get into a down cycle like this that we can capture additional savings and as I alluded to previously that given our financial capability, we're also able to invest during the cycle and capture a lower cost structure on resources that we had plan to commercialize in the future.", "So, I think very well positioned, we've got a very capable organization that keeps their eye on the fundamentals through the cycle and I think we're as I've said in the past we got to lead that cost curve.", "Blake Fernandez", "The second question is for you Jeff. The recent decision to increase the dividend, obviously an interesting time to enact that obviously demonstrates confidence. But noticing in the debt balance has increased about $11 billion from year ago levels. I'm just curious, if you could talk a little bit about how you're thinking about shareholder returns and using the balance sheet to continue levering up dependent on how long as down cycle would remain?", "Jeff Woodbury", "I think it's good question Blake. When you think about from a perspective of our capital occasion, nothing has changed and we have maintained a very disciplined capital allocation approach throughout history in the highs and the lows with the focus on a long-term horizon. We remain committed to our shareholders to invest in attractive business opportunities that are accretive to financial performance and to continue paying a reliable and grown dividend. Across that business cycle I'd say that we manage the cash by as we've said before returning the access to our shareholders to share repurchases or borrowing the fund our investments. But I think what you've seen with the increase in the dividend -- we're continuing the stock purchases underscore our commitment to shareholder distributions. And I think it also demonstrates the confidence that we have in our integrated business model.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Asit Sen with Cowen and Company.", "Asit Sen", "So two quick questions. First on LNG utilization, I think in your prepared remarks mentioned, utilization improving a little bit, could you elaborate, is it primarily related to PNG ramp up or is there anything else going on?", "Jeff Woodbury", "So, LNG utilization is broadly defined by several operational commercial factors. I mean including maintenance, reliability of our facilities and then market and commercial considerations.", "Asit Sen", "And then shifting gears to the Permian, Jeff last year Exxon added about 65,000 net acres in the core Wolfcamp. How do you see opportunities evolving in this current macro-environment and on that could you update us on activity and volume relative to last quarter please on the Shell plays?", "Jeff Woodbury", "So broadly speaking, as I said, earlier when we're talking about M&A that we keep alert to where we got opportunities to build the portfolio with a creative assets, so those opportunities come along -- we'll go ahead and consider them. We're making great progress as you heard in our analyst meeting in terms of cost efficiency improvements, productivity improvements not only from our drilling completions but also initial well rates. So we really good progress, we get great opportunities in the Permian and in the Bakken. Just broadly speaking in the three key plays that liquid plays that we've in unconventional we're running just south of 40 rigs right now, that's been trending downward in part commensurate with the efficiency and productivity improvements that we've been able to capture.", "Asit Sen", "And do you see -- how do you see this evolving in the balance of the year trending down through the year end?", "Jeff Woodbury", "We have been trending downward like I said because we've been able to maintain real-time capture of additional benefits. So, I wouldn't translate that into a linear relationship with activity levels.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Edward Westlake with Credit Suisse.", "Edward Westlake", "Obviously just moving to Holland, Groningen's been in the news again. I'm just trying to understand what sort of decline did you assume that the Groningen field was going to have say over the next to 2017 in your planning numbers. And how do you assess the risk that it might actually be lower and then I have a follow up.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Ed when you referred to decline, I think you're referring to the production constraints that have been post.", "Edward Westlake", "And obviously you laid out a sort of corporate production objective for the firm, Groningen's a part of that. So was just trying to get a sense of what was already in the numbers -- so if it does get worse we can sort of quickly estimate the impact.", "Jeff Woodbury", "So first let me start with the impacts in our operating performance here both quarter-over-quarter as well sequential, actually Netherlands was up due to higher demand but that was offset by some constraints. I'll be clear upfront Ed that we did incorporate the advertise restrictions into the volumes projections that we shared with you last month.", "Edward Westlake", "So if they get worse then that would be a negative delta?", "Jeff Woodbury", "It really is a function of what happens due to changes in demand throughout the year but certainly there is more extreme restrictions that will have an impact.", "Edward Westlake", "And then a broader question which is more demand related obviously Exxon has refining chemicals upstream businesses around the world. You've started to see some demand estimates from the main agencies to be revised upwards, but apart from the sort of chink of light that you saw in Europe, your opening comments were little bit down based on the global economy. So just trying to gauge I guess whether you think that the recent increases in some of the demand estimates are real or not and if not what might be the reasons things like tertiary rebuilding?", "Jeff Woodbury", "So from a downstream perspective, we did see margin improvements but due to several different reasons if you think about in Europe there was some capacity that was brought off line within both Europe and Asia as well as due to lower crude prices as well as some planned and unplanned maintenance that was taking capacity off the system. And then lastly there was some fundamental demand improvement in a number of products like gas, distillate, fuel oil. We saw similar benefits in the U.S. as well. Going into the future I would be bit reluctant to extrapolate that beyond this quarter.", "Edward Westlake", "The earnings performance what about demands or both?", "Jeff Woodbury", "You are talking about?", "Edward Westlake", "Global demand for products.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Global demand. Let me start with the chemicals business. Our projection on global demand for the chemicals business is that\u2019s going to continue to grow greater than the GDP about 1.5%. Refining demand will I think is function of what happens in the economies.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jason Gammel with Jefferies.", "Jason Gammel", "I just wanted to ask specifically about the international upstream earnings, most of your peers have quantified the effect of the change in the UK tax laws within their releases, and I appreciate that you have addressed the variance that has occurred in the other section but I was hoping to get the absolute amount from you.", "Jeff Woodbury", "So let me give you a little bit more color on just the tax rate. As you seen in our supplemental information we had effective tax rate of little over 33% and that\u2019s about a 12% drop quarter-on-quarter. And as you would appreciate the effective tax rate is an outcome of our business results across the geographies in which we operate within, now most of that drop was really due to the portfolio mix of income across our business segments and our geographies, about 3% of that was associated with one-time tax items primarily the UK tax rate change which amounted to about $200 million positive impact on earnings.", "Jason Gammel", "Another question, that\u2019s completely separate topic, just in the current oil price environment, haven't seen a lot of deflation yet. Are you expecting to make any FIDs this year? And if you could address Hadria North specifically?", "Jeff Woodbury", "So Jason I would encourage you go look at our recent financial operating review, if you look at that you will see that we have a list of projects that we anticipate that will start up post 2017, and that will give you a sense for the next tranche of development opportunities that are currently in play. And many of these are in development planning stages or even some in pre-FID. And that will give you a sense for what\u2019s on the horizon. We don't broadcast planned FIDs in the future but we do give you a pretty detailed list of what\u2019s out there that we are working on.", "Jason Gammel", "Maybe if I could just put it another way, have you seen enough cost deflation in the deepwater yet to maybe accelerate your investment potential in that area or have you seen very little in terms of cost deflation?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Frankly I will tell you Jason that we are never really satisfied with the cost structure and we will always continue to work on it, but as you can appreciate there are lot of factors and as I indicated earlier we have seen a where I consider early innings of reductions in services like rig rates, we expect that we would be able to do a lot more. And as I alluded to previously that also includes an expectation within our organization that will be able to further optimize these development plans to maximize shareholder returns. But I'd tell you that we got a very, very large diverse resource base to work on, it allows us to be very selective in what we decided to pursue. And when we decide when we get to an FID stage it's been tested across a range of economic considerations since that was confident it's going to be accretive to overall financial performance.", "Operator", "Phil Gresh from JP Morgan has our next question.", "Phil Gresh", "One question on the quarter you talked about the benefit from lower tax rates, I know you'd proceeds from assets sales as well. So just wondering if there any one-time benefits from assets sale gains?", "Jeff Woodbury", "As you say in our materials that we sent out there was about just under $500 million cash flow benefited associated with assets sales. That translates to about a 50% reduction in the number if you unwind the remaining un-depreciated investment that we have on our books. And those proceeds are really result of sales really across tour upstream and downstream businesses. ", "Phil Gresh", "And then you've talked about a fair number of investment you're making Europe to high grade your refining capacity to this lift. I guess maybe just give us an update or remind me when that\u2019s supposed to be coming online. And then on the U.S. side what opportunities might there be to debottleneck or add new capacity here over the next few years, if you think that that\u2019s a decent return project.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Phil I guess you're referring to our Antwerp coker?", "Phil Gresh", "Yes exactly.", "Jeff Woodbury", "So really good progress on that investment opportunity, I'd tell you that it's progressing towards 2017 start up.", "Phil Gresh", "And then on the U.S. do you see any opportunities there to debottleneck capacity or add new capacity in any of your refineries in the next few years?", "Jeff Woodbury", "No we regularly evaluate our portfolio book in the U.S. internationally for where we can capture additional value for earnings growth. I'd tell you that while I'm not in a position go ahead and give you any indications specifically that we keep very mindful of where we can capture additional value and primarily falls in fork here is one is trying to further improve our flexibility of our feedstock. Two, is opportunities that we can further reduce our cost structure. The third one would be in areas where we can increase our higher value product yields. And then lastly as you saw with Edmonton Rail Terminal improving our overall logistics flexibility.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Douglas Terreson with Evercore ISI.", "Douglas Terreson", "So my question is also on Groningen, there is been a lot of commentary about the issue surrounding seismic conditions and property in the area. My question is whether or not we could kind of get a little bit more color on the situation. Meaning it sounds like when you answered Ed questions a few minutes ago that the implication for production maybe negligible. But I just want to make sure I heard that correctly. And then also, there is also been talks of some financial penalties too. So in commentary that you could provide that would help us sort this out would be appreciated.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes so most of the information as you know is been digested in the media. Just broadly speaking the original target was about 42 billion cubic meters in 2014, that\u2019s been originally reduced down about 36 billion cubic meters and then in the first half 2015 down to 16.5. It's still very dynamic issue. Our understanding is there will be some further guidance from the government coming out in July. But broadly speaking as I refer to it previously our production guidance has been incorporating the reduction production constraints that had been advertised externally. But it is having an impact and I don\u2019t want to mislead to anybody.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.", "Ryan Todd", "Maybe a follow up on an earlier comments that you made on Canadian crude. How big is the rail terminal that you are working on up there and how much crude can you actually move out of there by rail once it up and running. And can you give us any difference is obviously been very tough out there in terms of heavy barrels, any thoughts does in the crude terminal in terms of ways in which might be other optimize pricing going forward?", "Jeff Woodbury", "So the capacity of that terminal was just over 200,000 barrels a day 210,000 barrels to be exact. You emphasize a point I made earlier that it's part of our integrated businesses. It's a key element for us to connect our upstream business to our refining and chemicals business throughout the Gulf coast and the Mid-Continent.", "Ryan Todd", "And then maybe a quick follow-up on gas decline as well. We saw a relatively steep decline in U.S. gas lines quarter-on-quarter and really there is a lot of quarter-to-quarter volatility. But can you give us an idea of generally a good assumption for what you would assume for annual decline rate in U.S. gas?", "Jeff Woodbury", "I would say just to your point, our gas activity is been fairly limited in the U.S. We have really transitioned a lot of our drilling activity in lower 48 to liquids place obviously because we see the value proposition stronger, but I really backup and highlight the point that there is a real opportunity in the U.S. to commercialize this gas if we were to remove some of the barriers that we've got before us, and we've got as you all are aware we've got an investment pending in Golden Pass to convert that terminal to LNG export facility.", "We think we\u2019re well positioned with infrastructure, we think it is a great opportunity for United States if we could increase the export options for the U.S. producers is going to create additional investment, it's going to create additional jobs, and bottom-line it's going to improve the economy.", "So I think the call to the government would be one of really taking advantage of the opportunity that the U.S. has to really build energy security not only in the U.S. but more globally by providing if you will free-trading.", "Operator", "Roger Read with Wells Fargo has our next question. ", "Roger Read", "I would like to follow-up a little bit on some of the volume guidance and the entitlements in a fairly significant amount of barrels that came back in. And as you think about the 4.1 million barrels for the full year the outperformance in Q2. Is there upside based on entitlements or would you say your projection based on expectation in the future curve as oil pricing et cetera that we should think as 4.1 is really the right number.", "Jeff Woodbury", "I would tell you, if you go back to the analyst presentation, we had assumed just for the sake of the presentation itself we assumed Brent price of $55 per barrel, and of course flow that into our production sharing contracts to give you a sense for what we would expect in terms of volume and that is target of 4.1 million barrels per day, obviously if prices up or down is going to have an impact. It's really -- I really don't have a rule of thumb for you when it comes down an entitlement impacts which as you know include many different factors including the commercial structure as well as expenditure levels and obviously price. But we had assumed a price forecast is comparable to where we\u2019re right now.", "Roger Read", "And then back to the OpEx cost reductions is there any guidance you can provide us on or any help you can provide us in terms of how that work its way into this system or whether or not most of that has been captured during the first half of this year or so Q1 and in the Q2?", "Jeff Woodbury", "In fact the guidance I gave you Roger is that we\u2019re going to see further capture opportunities as we progress through the year.", "Roger Read", "So should we think majority is come through or minority, morality?", "Jeff Woodbury", "We have been able to capture savings in the first quarter, but as I alluded to not all parts of our cost structure have responded in the same level and we will continue to progress those and we expect increased savings over time.", "Operator", "We will go next to Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.", "Brad Heffern", "Most of my questions have been answered but I will try more on macro one. Obviously Exxon is always prior to itself on investing with more long-term demand view point. Do you think that with the current down cycle we've taken enough CapEx out of the industry that we\u2019re going to face more of supply demand squeeze going forward maybe later in the decade or early in the 2020?", "Jeff Woodbury", "That\u2019s a hard one to really answer. I would step back and just think about the overall energy outlook that we publish annually. We are fairly confident given the range of variables that we test that we\u2019re looking at about a 35% growth in energy demand between 2010 and 2040. Fundamentally that is how ExxonMobil sets its investment plans. And obviously we continue to test that not only annually but periodically in terms of how the business more broadly speaking is investing whether that\u2019s going to be sufficient to meet that energy growth over time there are a lot of variables in it including you may recall that inner energy outlook it really does require a very healthy progress on energy conservation. But broadly speaking it's hard for me to say whether the current level investment will cause any shortages in the future.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Anish Kapadia with TPH.", "Anish Kapadia", "I have couple of questions, first one was to get your thoughts on Tanzania LNG. I saw that you went non-concern on the last exploration well with Statoil and it didn\u2019t think that featured in any of the four projects you highlighted on the slide in the Analyst Day. Just wondering if this is something that\u2019s going to drop to the back of the queue that you've prioritized in this kind of environment and your CapEx cut back.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Not at all, Tanzania for the benefits of the people are on the phone Block 2 today we have participated in seven gas discoveries we think total resource and places in excess of 20 TCF now. There is a lot of work to do in a Greenfield development like this we Statoil and ExxonMobil have been progressing development plans for the initial discoveries. And then there is a broader consortium that has been looking at the potential for onshore LNG facility. We would tell you that upfront planning is progressing. I will confirm that there was one well we do not participate in. But I wouldn\u2019t use that as an indication of our lack of commitment. I think what's important here as we go forward is we get better definition of the project. But equally important you all know that LNG projects are capital intensive and what we need to ensure is that we have a stable fiscal regime with appropriate terms and conditions to underpin that type of investment.", "Anish Kapadia", "And one follow up question on the -- going back to the acquisition market what we're seeing is. It seems like lot of the U.S and E&P companies we integrated pulling out of international investing more in U.S see a similar trends with some of the NOCs. So just wondering are you seeing more value internationally and less competition and for actually for assets now relative to the U.S market.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Well I think broadly speaking it's a good observation, broadly speaking I think when capital becomes constraint that by definition that provides additional opportunities. I would say that from our perspective it's the value proposition that we bring that we hope that resource owners will look to and that is our strong balance sheet our leading return on capital employed, our operational expertise, the technology that we bring to resource development.", "I'll say that we have one of the best if not the best project execution organizations. And then we've got a leading downstream and chemical business that\u2019s fully integrated with our upstream and I'd say that as a package those characteristics provide if you will the winning proposition for resource owners.", "Operator", "Our last question today comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.", "Pavel Molchanov", "Can I go back to the balance sheet? You've always said maintaining triple A is critical given that you are not currently funding the dividend and the buyback from cash flow. What do you think is the cushion that you have in billions to lever up and still maintain the triple A?", "Jeff Woodbury", "I'd say that triple A is really an outcome of our financial strategies. As you heard us say previously that operating cash flows our primary sources of funding for both of our cap departments and shareholder distributions. We maintain a very strong focus and prudent approach to cash management throughout that cycle. We have as you know significant debt capacity. But we'll maintain our financial flexibility and we'll continue to be very disciplined in how we invest and what we choose to invest in but we're not going to forgo attractive opportunities and I think that\u2019s a key differentiating factor for ExxonMobil that we got the capability to respond when we need to respond. And we're very mindful of our cash balances and how far we want to take our investment program.", "Pavel Molchanov", "Can I ask you just a little bit on that, have you looked at what the credit agencies might say if you take on an additional 5 billion to 10 billion over the next year, 1.5 years?", "Jeff Woodbury", "We're very -- obviously we look at all the variables when we talk about our cash management and our financing capability, we keep the very mindful look at what our comment mature in the future, but I'll tell you that we're very comfortable and we're very mindful about where we're in terms of our debt. But I've just not going to quote any specific numbers.", "Operator", "With no further questions in the queue, I'd like to turn the callback over to Mr. Woodbury for any additional and closing remark.", "Jeff Woodbury", "First and foremost I want to say thank you for your questions, very good, very insightful and I think it really brings with more color to our business. So to conclude, I just want to thank you for your time and we're very much due appreciate your interest in ExxonMobil. Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen again that's does conclude today's conference.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome to ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings call and Webcast. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our Web-site. Before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2.", "Now turning to Slide 3, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our performance. ExxonMobil generated earnings of $4.2 billion in the second quarter. We are delivering on our investment and operating commitments across our integrated portfolio. Corporation's results demonstrate sound operations, superior project execution capabilities and continued discipline in both capital and expense management.", "Downstream and Chemical earnings increased significantly from the second quarter of 2014 driven by higher margins, continued strong demand and the quality of our product and asset mix. Upstream production volumes of 4 million oil equivalent barrels per day were 3.6% higher compared to a year ago quarter and liquids volumes were up nearly 12%.", "Growth was underpinned by an increased level of new development start-ups over the last 18 months, largely in Africa, Canada, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the United States. These results underscore the resilience of our integrated portfolio and the benefits of our disciplined capital allocation. In the first half of 2015, the Corporation generated cash flow from operations and asset sales of $17.9 billion with free cash flow remaining positive despite challenging market conditions.", "Moving to Slide 4, we provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Global economic growth improved in the second quarter of 2015. The U.S. rebounded after contracting slightly in the first quarter. Europe improved marginally amid concerns on Greece, China's economy stabilized, while Japan's growth tapered. Crude oil prices partly recovered during the quarter while natural gas prices declined further. Refining margins continued to strengthen in both the U.S. and Europe. Chemical commodity margins also improved while specialty margins weakened.", "Turning now to the financial results as shown on Slide 5, as indicated, second quarter earnings were $4.2 billion, which represents $1 per share. Corporation distributed $4.1 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $1 billion was used to purchase shares. CapEx was $8.3 billion, which is in line with plans. We have remained focused on structural improvements through capital efficiency as well as the capture of additional cost savings in a softer market. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $9.4 billion, and at the end of the quarter cash totaled $4.4 billion and debt was $33.8 billion.", "Next slide provides additional detail on sources and uses of funds. For the quarter, cash decreased from $5.2 billion to $4.4 billion. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program, yielded $9.4 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included net investments in the business of $7.1 billion and shareholder distributions of $4.1 billion. Debt and other financing increased cash by $1 billion. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $500 million in the third quarter of 2015.", "Moving on to Slide 7 for a review of our segmented results, ExxonMobil second quarter earnings of $4.2 billion were down $4.6 billion from a year ago quarter. Lower Upstream earnings were partially offset by stronger Downstream and Chemical results. Gains on asset sales were $1.2 billion lower than the second quarter of 2014, reflecting the absence of the Hong Kong power and Canadian asset divestments in the Upstream segment.", "I'll also note that our corporate effective tax rate was 45%, up 4 percentage points compared to the year ago quarter and up 12 percentage points sequentially. This higher tax rate reflects the relative mix of income across geographies and tax regimes as well as a one-time increase in the corporate income tax rate in Alberta, Canada.", "In the sequential quarter comparison shown on Slide 8, earnings decreased by $750 million as lower Upstream and Downstream earnings were partly offset by higher Chemical results. Guidance for corporate and financing expenses remains at $500 million to $700 million per quarter.", "Now turning to the Upstream financial and operating results starting on Slide 9, Upstream earnings in the second quarter were $2 billion, down $5.9 billion from the second quarter of 2014. Sharply lower realizations decreased earnings by $1.5 billion where crude declined by almost $46 per barrel and gas was down almost $2.40 per thousand cubic feet. Note that favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings $330 million driven by production growth on our new developments.", "All other items were negative $1.7 billion and this was driven by the absence of divestment gains from Hong Kong power and Western Canadian assets which represented $1.6 billion. Also, the higher income tax rate in Alberta, Canada resulted in a negative $260 million non-cash deferred tax adjustment. Lower operating costs provided a partial offset.", "Moving to Slide 10, oil equivalent production increased 139,000 barrels per day or 3.6% compared to the second quarter of last year. Liquids production increased 243,000 barrels per day or nearly 12%, benefiting from new projects or programs and favorable entitlement impacts. Natural gas production decreased 622 million cubic feet per day or 5.8% driven by regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands. Volume adds from the Papua New Guinea LNG and Hadrian South projects along with entitlement effects offset build decline.", "Now turning to sequential comparison starting on Slide 11, Upstream earnings were $824 million lower than the first quarter. Realizations increased earnings by $600 million as crude was up almost $11 per barrel while gas declined about $1 per 1,000 cubic feet. Unfavorable volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $420 million driven by lower seasonal gas demand in Europe, regulatory constraints in the Netherlands and maintenance in the U.S. All other items reduced earnings by $1 billion, mainly driven by unfavorable tax and foreign exchange effects and lower gains from asset sales. Upstream unit profitability for the second quarter was $5.77 per barrel, excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes. Earnings per barrel for the first half of 2015 was $6.74.", "Moving to Slide 12, sequentially, volumes were down 269,000 oil equivalent barrels per day or 6.3%. Liquids production increased 14,000 barrels per day on new project growth and work programs, partly offset by maintenance, entitlement effects and field decline. Natural gas production was down 1.7 billion cubic feet per day driven by lower seasonal demand in Europe and regulatory constraints in the Netherlands.", "Moving now to the Downstream financial and operating results starting on Slide 13, Downstream earnings for the quarter were $1.5 billion, up $795 million compared to the second quarter of 2014. Our margins increased earnings by $1.1 billion. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $80 million. All other items reduced earnings by $230 million, driven by higher maintenance activities.", "Turning to Slide 14, sequentially, Downstream earnings decreased $161 million. Stronger refining margins mainly in the U.S. increased earnings by $140 million whereas higher maintenance activities reduced volumes and increased expenses by $160 million and $140 million respectively.", "Moving now to the Chemical financial and operating results starting on Slide 15, second quarter Chemical earnings were more than $1.2 billion, up $405 million versus the prior year quarter. Our margins increased earnings by $340 million. Favorable volume and mix effects added $20 million. All other items increased earnings by $50 million, mainly due to asset management gains, partly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange effects.", "Moving to Slide 16, sequentially, Chemical earnings increased by $264 million. Lower margins decreased earnings by $10 million. Positive volume and mix effects increased earnings by $40 million. All other items added $230 million as asset management gains were partly offset by higher maintenance.", "Moving next to an update on our exploration and project activities on Slide 17, we continue to focus on pursuing a diverse set of high-quality resource opportunities. In Guyana, ExxonMobil made a significant oil discovery on the 6.6 million acres Stabroek Block well which was drilled approximately 120 miles offshore, encountered more than 295 feet of high-quality oil\u2011bearing sandstone reservoirs. We are encouraged by these results and we're assessing commercial viability of the resource as well as evaluating additional potential on the block.", "In Romania, drilling continues in the deepwater Neptun Block with five wells drilled to date. The potential for commercial development will be assessed after completion of the drilling program. In the Kurdistan region of Iraq, drilling activities on the [Al-Kush] [ph] Block are underway and anticipated to finish later this year.", "Turning now to the status update on our new development projects, in Canada, the Kearl expansion project started up ahead of schedule in June and is currently producing more than 100,000 barrels of bitumen per day. This development of the Kearl resource enabled us to draw significant learnings from the initial development project and capture lower capital costs and operating efficiencies. From Kearl, production averaged 130,000 barrels per day in the second quarter and is ultimately expected to reach 220,000 barrels per day.", "Erha North Phase 2 in Nigeria is another example of a capital efficient development. This subsea project utilizes existing processing facilities and avoids the need for an additional FPSO vessel. Deepwater drilling and subsea equipment installation are progressing with start-up expected later this year.", "And at the Banyu Urip development in Indonesia, we continue to experience favorable well performance and production is now more than 80,000 barrels per day. The central processing facility is expected to start up in the next few months which will enable the project to reach peak production of more than 200,000 barrels per day by year-end.", "In the U.S., Lower 48 onshore, we have maintained a measured investment program to unlock the value of more than 15 billion oil equivalent barrels. ExxonMobil is a leading producer onshore and the largest producer in the United States. Through our XTO affiliate, we operate in all major U.S. unconventional oil and gas plays. Longer-term, gas investment is paced with anticipated demand growth whereas near-term emphasis is on the development of 2.4 million net acres in the liquids rich Bakken, Permian and Woodford, Ardmore and Marietta where investment opportunities remain attractive in phased price environment. Net production in these three areas was about 240,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in the second quarter, up more than 20% from the second quarter of last year.", "Throughout the commodity price cycle, ExxonMobil has a relentless focus on reducing costs and improving efficiency in our operations while maintaining high operational integrity. We regularly assess our performance relative to the competitors and strive to be best in class. So as this chart illustrates, our efforts deliver results. XTO is a leader in exploration and development costs per barrel of crude reserves added, just one metric of many that are considered.", "This position is enabled by our disciplined and measured approach to resource development, deployment of proprietary technologies and our intense focus on efficiency and productivity. We also demonstrated the capability to respond quickly and a rapidly changing environment and to date have captured incremental savings of about 30% drilling and completion cost from the peak in 2014. These savings include market benefits as well as ongoing structural cost efficiencies and productivity improvements across our operations.", "So I'd like to conclude this morning's comments with a summary of our year-to-date performance. In short, the Corporation is delivering on its investment and operating commitments. Through midyear, ExxonMobil earned $9.1 billion benefiting from our integrated business which captures value throughout the commodity price cycle as demonstrated by our Downstream and Chemical results. In the Upstream, production increased to 4.1 million oil equivalent barrels per day, up almost 3% year on year and remains in line with our plans.", "Volume contributions from successful new developments underscore our superb project execution capabilities and reputation as a reliable operator. Our operational results combined with continued capital discipline generated cash flow from operations and asset sales of $17.9 billion and free cash flow of $3.9 billion. Our commitment to our shareholders remains strong as the Corporation distributed $8 billion to shareholders through midyear. So regardless of industry conditions, we remain focused on what we control and are driven to create shareholder value through the cycle.", "That concludes my prepared remarks and I would now be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go to Phil Gresh with J.P. Morgan.", "Phil Gresh", "First question is one asking the CapEx, what your latest thoughts are for the budget for this year, and then as we look ahead post 2015, at the Analyst Day you said sub-$34 billion, it was a bit vague, a lot of your peers have been talking about reducing their sustaining capital cost as you look ahead. So just wanted to get any thoughts from you about perhaps where CapEx could go over the next few years, if you have any updates.", "Jeff Woodbury", "I'll tell you that we have no new guidance on our \u2013 so our CapEx guidance for 2015 remains at $34 billion, but having said, given our ongoing focus on capital efficiency and the very successful capture of market savings in the current business climate, I think it is fair to say that there is a downward vector on that number. And that type of focus and efficiency will be carried on into the subsequent years. I haven't said that, also note that we continue to invest in the business and we have a very attractive inventory of high-quality opportunities, and given the financial flexibility we've got, we can garner some real benefits during the down cycle in a softer market environment.", "Phil Gresh", "Sure, okay. Second question is on the acquisition environment, seems like others have been talking about the bid ask spread, maybe starting to improve a bit here, maybe you could just talk about what you're seeing, are any attractive opportunities starting to pop up on your radar screen, and just more broadly, as you think about the portfolio, are there places where you think inorganically you'd like to shift the mix every time, and I'm specifically thinking about short cycle?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Let me just broadly speak on acquisition or what we like to say as asset management, I characterize it for us as businesses as normal. We always keep alert to value opportunities not only to pick up what we believe is strategic and high-value opportunities but looking for means to create greater value from our existing portfolio. So we keep alert in terms of what we would target.", "If you step back and think about the diversity of our resource base, we're very well covered across all of the resource types. We're always interested in expanding those positions or further high-grading them. So I wouldn't suggest that as we consider opportunities for picking up additional assets that we're more focused in one area or the other, we're always looking for high-grade in the portfolio. And Phil, that also includes our exploration program. It is designed to identify higher value opportunities to be added to the resource base or maybe to displace what we see is not as relatively significant as the exploration program can add to.", "Operator", "Next we'll go to Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Doug Leggate", "Sorry my line cut out there for a minute, so I hope this question hasn't been asked already, but there's two things I wanted to hit this morning, Jeff, if I may. First one is on tax. I'm trying to understand the extent of I guess the mess on the internationally Imperial we're all looking at anyway, and we're noting what Imperial did with their tax charge related to the change in the Canadian tax regime. So I wonder if you could address that issue first, and then I have a follow-up please.", "Jeff Woodbury", "So if you look at our tax in the second quarter of 2015 relative to 2014, we're up just over 3%. I'd say that about 5% of that were associated with one-time tax items, the largest piece being in the Alberta tax that I mentioned in my prepared comments. The rest of the closure on that, down about 1% is really due to the portfolio mix of income across our various business segments and geographies. If you look sequentially, Doug, we're up almost 12%. And again, the mix effect adds about a 6% increase and the one-time items add about 6%, 4% due to the Alberta tax increase and then just under 2% associated with the absence of the first quarter U.K.'s tax rate change.", "Doug Leggate", "In absolute terms, Jeff, order of magnitude it looks to us like that was somewhere around $0.10 or $0.12 in the quarter of non-recurring non-cash. Is that sum about right?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Say a little bit more, Doug, on how you're coming up with that.", "Doug Leggate", "So I think the $320 million was what Imperial took, that alone is $0.08, right?", "Jeff Woodbury", "The Alberta, as I said in my prepared comments, Doug, was about $260 million ExxonMobil share.", "Doug Leggate", "Okay, alright. I'll go back and look at that. My follow-up is really on the Downstream. I mean obviously, I realize for commercial reasons you don't want to talk about Torrance explicitly but when we look at the can of results that other West Coast operators have had and the relatively weak year at Downstream that you had, it kind of strikes me that you probably have some \u2013 there's probably some merit in giving us some idea of what the likelihood of Torrance coming back on line is without all the additional cost of importing gasoline and so on. So to the best that you can at this point, Jeff, can you give us an order of magnitude in terms of timing as to when you expect Torrance to get back to where it ought to be?", "Jeff Woodbury", "I think first if I could, Doug, just to comment on your statement about a relatively weak Downstream in the second quarter, now I'd first say that we've seen significant margin improvement relative to last year. Second, as I commented on, we did have a very heavy maintenance period in the second quarter of 2015 and that had the downward impacts I referenced in my prepared comments.", "In terms of Torrance, I think you probably know, Doug, that some of the units in the refinery are operational that reduced rates. We are producing gasoline by importing components and blending with refinery production, and I'd also say we're also producing distillates. We are progressing repair of the electrostatic precipitator as well as pursuing interim options. It is difficult to provide you a time at this point, given the definition work that's underway as well as the regulatory review that's underway. As we get closer to defining that timeline, we'll look for an opportunity to share that broadly.", "Doug Leggate", "I appreciate you there. You've at least taken a stab at the answer. Thanks, Jeff.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Blake Fernandez with Howard and Weil.", "Blake Fernandez", "Question for you on the gas volumes which were fairly weak, I think you pointed out in the press release 622 million cubic feet down year-over-year. Could you highlight the Netherlands component of that, maybe give us an update of, for one, what contribution the Netherlands had in that decline, and then maybe some timing or outlook on when that may come back?", "Jeff Woodbury", "The Netherlands was, as you could appreciate, a large component. It was about 600 million in the second quarter relative to the prior year, prior quarter.", "Blake Fernandez", "Okay, and any thoughts on when that may return to market?", "Jeff Woodbury", "The Netherlands on a quarter to quarter basis was also say with the regulatory restrictions that the government has placed on the asset, and that will return over time but it's going to be a constrained cap on what we can produce from the resource.", "Blake Fernandez", "Okay, fair enough. The second question for you, on Slide 11 you highlighted some of the sequential decline. I guess I know the benchmarks were up, I know you've got some issues with tax and whatnot, but that $1 billion waterfall on other category, can you kind of highlight what is in there besides tax and then also if you could maybe highlight some of the LNG impacts? I know pricing got clearly weak this quarter.", "Jeff Woodbury", "So on the $1 billion other component, this is the [indiscernible] and about 60% of that had to do with tax, 15% or so was Forex and the rest is a number of other puts and takes. On your comment about LNG, let me just broadly say that our natural gas realizations had a negative effect of about $300 million. So to square that with the $600 million increase in realizations, we had about $900 million positive due to liquids and $300 million due to negative gas realizations.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.", "Evan Calio", "Let me follow up on CapEx and the down-cycle approach, your peers appear or at least are more vocal in cost-cutting and laying off employees, increasing asset sales and reducing the forward CapEx guidance to close their funding gaps by almost extensional upstream struggle. So I mean your releasing call has been different. Is that just stylistic or does it mean a different approach by Exxon through the down-cycle, any comments there?", "Jeff Woodbury", "I would back up and just talk fundamentally. Culturally, the organization is designed to constantly focus on capital efficiency and cost management, okay. What we are looking for always, Evan, is to drive the cost structure down in the business, okay, and when we have a down-cycle like we're seeing right now, we further are well-positioned to quickly lead that cost curve in capturing market savings. Now on top of that, we've got that financial flexibility to invest through the cycle and that does very much very well position us to capture those market savings in the down-cycle. So in short, I'd say it is a focus regardless of where we are in the cycle.", "Likewise on staffing, I mean you mentioned common staffing. I mean first and foremost, I want to highlight that our people are our greatest asset and they really drive the success of this Company. Therefore we take a very measured approach managing our headcount given the cyclical nature of the business and the need for us to be ever more productive and in doing so we keep an unrelenting focus on capturing organizational efficiencies to keep the organization right sized, again, given the likelihood of business volatility.", "So if you look at our employee headcount, it has been coming down consistently since the merger of Exxon and Mobil where we were at about 125,000 employees, today we're at just over 80,000 employees. And you may recall during Analyst Meeting that the Chairman talked about some this and he gave some examples by way of steps that we've taken well in advance of the down-cycle in order to do exactly what the numbers are depicting.", "Evan Calio", "Right, and your CapEx appears to be trending at least below guidance so far this year. My follow-up on the Downstream and maybe as it relates to the U.S. Upstream, I mean can you discuss like crude transfer pricing assumptions between North American Upstream and refining? I mean it would appear that refining with offset may not be entirely market-based kind of understating refining and transferring some of that to your Upstream, any color there would be helpful.", "Jeff Woodbury", "I mean it is very much market-based. I mean as you know that our integrated sites have the capability to run at very, very wide range of feedstocks. I can't get into the specific pricing at all but we have very competitive capacity within the U.S., we're the largest in the Gulf Coast and mid-continent. As you know, our capacity increase is greater than our overall U.S. production. So we're also out there picking up supplies that meet our systems needs.", "Our mid-continent and Gulf Coast refineries have increased processing of advantaged North American crudes. Currently about 45% of the slate was North America in 2011 and currently we're at about 70% in 2014. The key point I want to emphasize here is that we get intrinsic value given the integration of our operations between Upstream, Downstream and the Chemical business, allowing us to really focus on optimizing the value of the molecule.", "Operator", "Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse has our next question.", "Edward Westlake", "This is just a philosophical question. I mean, Jeff, you've got a great balance sheet and you've just reduced the buyback. Are you worried about future deterioration in cash flows due to the macro, is this just a decision that's just made quarter to quarter without thinking about the implications? I know people are chattering in the market this morning that you're trying to conserve cash for M&A, so maybe just a comment there, and then I've got a detailed comment on the results.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Ed, just go back, fundamentally our business plans and our investment strategy comes from our perspective on the long-term that we share with you all in our energy outlook. That's what really sets our business strategy and our investment outlook. Now stepping back from that, we maintain a very robust balance sheet as you say and we have the significant inventory investment opportunities, over 90 billion barrels of high-quality resource, a very strong inventory of Downstream and Chemical opportunities, but we manage the cash flow looking at the current business climate as well as the future outlook and we have a high degree of confidence in what we expect supply/demand to do in the future. Fundamentally, we're committed to our shareholders to continue to provide a reliable and grown dividend and I think the continued buyback is evidence of the confidence that we have in the integrated business model.", "Edward Westlake", "You mentioned the LNG impact which was helpful. Obviously Asia LNG prices might come in the spot market particularly, not contract, come under where the pressure is. All of these Australian projects try and fight their way into market and they all have commission cargoes and some spot with them. Can you sort of give us a sense of how much flexibility in the overall contract structure your customers have to sort of say, we're going to take minimum amounts of volumes to maximize our advantage to take some perhaps the cheapest bulk cargoes that are available? I'm just trying to get a sense of is there a little bit of the margin or price risk and volume risk even to your sort of existing LNG business, and it's fine for you to say, no, there's not a big risk, I mean that could just be the answer.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Sure. I'd just remind you that a majority of our LNG is under long-term contract. So we have very little spot risk and we've got diversion capability in the existing contracts to allow us to capture a greater value there.", "Edward Westlake", "So if Asia says, no, you can put it into Europe or do something else from the Middle East.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.", "Neil Mehta", "So it's pretty clear that there is a path to grow production through 2017 with some of these large capital projects that you talked about and seeing indications of production growth here in 2015, one of the questions investors frequently ask is, how does Exxon grow production post 2017 which we'll probably get some line of sight on at the next Analyst Day when you roll forward past 2017, but any initial color about how you think about growth especially if the forward curve proves correct post 2017 would be valuable?", "Jeff Woodbury", "I'd say first and foremost, just step back a moment and remind everybody that based on that very sizable high-quality resource base we've been talking about, we've had a very significant Upstream investment program in place now for some period of time whereby from 2012 to 2017 we had committed to our shareholders to bring on 32 high-quality long-life assets. We're about halfway through that in terms of starting them up. We had a very substantial tranche of them starting up in 2014 with eight. This year we have another seven starting up. As you go into 2016-2017, we've got the rest of them coming on. The information that we had shared back at Analyst Meeting, we would grow capacity by about 1.1 million oil equivalent barrels per day, and recognizing that those projects are starting up in 2017, we're just at the early stages, they would ramp up into 2018 and thereafter.", "We also shared, Neil, in our F&O review the list of projects that we've got on the table right now for 2018 forward. These are all in different stages of progress, some are in development planning, some are in [beat] [ph], but that is the list that we are working on to bring to an FID decision. Some of these that we're working to further optimize in the current price environment, some may have some opportunities to enhance the commercial terms, but as we get closer to FID's decisions, we'll signal where we are. As you indicated, we'll provide another update in March of next year which will take us beyond the 2017 horizon.", "But all that said, I want to reinforce that we've got this very robust inventory of investment opportunities and I don't want to focus just on the Upstream, the Downstream and Chemical business as well, and that positions us well to be very selective on what we want to progress and when we want to progress, and it gives us the capability on those other assets or investment opportunities to keep working on them to make sure that we're capturing the greatest value from it.", "Neil Mehta", "Thanks, Jeff. And then the follow-up is on that point about Chemicals, it was one of the few places in the quarter where we saw a real upside to our numbers. Just wanted to talk about what you're seeing from the macro in the Chemical space, clearly margins having compressed as much as some would've thought given the move down in Brent and then just how you're thinking about growing that business on a go forward.", "Jeff Woodbury", "So just broadly speaking, as you can appreciate, there are structural differences in the Chemical business. U.S. natural gas, natural gas liquids provide for very strong margins and advantage polyethylene. In Europe, Asia-Pacific, the liquids fees, energy prices have been hard and we were at the bottom cycle in Asia-Pacific but we saw in the first half material improvement due to lower fees and energy costs.", "Specialty margins have declined over the past few years with capacity additions exceeding demand growth, but demand growth remains robust. So as we've said before, our long-term business we have a positive outlook for global demand expecting to exceed GDP by about 1.5%, or said in another way, growing by more than 50% over the next 10 years, of which about two thirds of that will be in Asia. So very well positioned to participate, as you see that we're making some important investments like the expansion of Baytown that allows us to continue to participate in the high value polyethylene market given the very low feed cost we have here in North America.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Allen Good with Morningstar.", "Allen Good", "I appreciate the comments on the whole savings in the U.S. Lower 48. I wonder if you could offer what Exxon is seeing as far as cost savings internationally, free the projects under construction, maybe some currently in the development phase and maybe even offshore as well, do you expect to capture some of the cost savings there and what would be some of the timing on that relative to what you've seen so far in the U.S.?", "Jeff Woodbury", "I would tell you Allen that let me break it up between capital and expense, and to answer your question right now, yes, we are capturing cost savings across our global portfolio. On the cost side, I just want to keep on emphasizing, cost management is a fundamental driver in the success of our business, no doubt about it, and throughout that business cycle our organization has a strong culture of driving down the cost structure and then when we're in these down cycles we expect to lead the cost curve and capture additional market savings, so ongoing structure improvements and additional market savings in the down-cycle.", "So we're very well positioned and one of the things that allows us to react very quick, as I mentioned last quarter, is that we've got a global procurement organization that is always focused on capturing the lowest lifecycle cost and they are absolutely critical in managing our overall cost structure.", "As you can appreciate, Allen, savings vary significantly by region and type of service. By way of example, our base metals are down as much as 40%. Engineering services and construction labor is down 10% plus. Rig rates are down across the board both land and floater. On floater, the day rates of mobilization costs are down anywhere from 25% to 40%. So we're well positioned to capture that both on the cost as well as the capital side.", "Allen Good", "Great, thanks. One more question, maybe a bit premature but certainly made headlines of late, along with the Iran deal, it seems that some of your peers have become interested, I know there's been some headlines suggesting Exxon as well, what would you need to see in Iran as far as milestones for you potentially become interesting and doing business there?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Allen, I'd just say that we'll continue to monitor the circumstance and I want to be really clear that we'll remain in full compliance with existing sanctions. As you know there are multiple sanctions that apply to U.S. companies. That's all I can really say about that right now, Allen.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Asit Sen with Cowen and Company.", "Asit Sen", "Two questions. Thanks for the additional color on Lower 48. I'm wondering if you could give us the breakdown in the production and rig activity by the three main unconventional plays and talk about how you expect things tracking in the back half of the year.", "Jeff Woodbury", "So really good growth there, I mean from a net production basis, as I said we're producing about 240,000 barrels a day, over 20% increase quarter on quarter versus the prior year. Permian is about 120,000 barrels of that, Bakken just over 80,000 barrels, and Woodford is about 40,000 barrels.", "Asit Sen", "And rig activity please?", "Jeff Woodbury", "So our rig counts have come down just a little bit. From the first quarter we're down about 10 rigs, so we're currently running 34 rigs in those three plays. We've been able to continue to high-grade the activity. I think as we showed in the Analyst Meeting, we continue to capture both cost efficiencies and productivity improvements. A lot of what we learned in these plays are being quickly shared to make sure that we're integrating all those learnings into our forward execution plans, but very pleased with the positions that we've got in those assets and we've got a very sizable inventory of drillable prospects.", "Asit Sen", "So would you think that there would be upside to the incremental 2017 target? I think it was 150,000 barrels a day. Would you, given efficiencies?", "Jeff Woodbury", "I mean we are keeping a measured pace as we said previously. If you think back over the ups and downs, when everybody was really picking up a lot of rigs, we took a measured pace and made sure that we were going at a pace that we can fully capture the benefits of the learnings that we were realizing. Likewise in the down-cycle, our rig counts haven't come down as significant as you've seen in the industry because we've been able to capture those learnings, the economics of these investments are still robust. So I would give you a response of a measured pace that with a very attractive inventory of opportunities, we'll keep moving forward and anticipate as we showed in the Analyst Meeting a growth in our unconventional liquids volumes.", "Asit Sen", "Great. And my second question is on LNG. Spot LNG market has been surprisingly strong, over $8 near-term, would be 15% oil equivalent. Just wanted to get your thoughts on that, is it seasonality or something else, and could you update on the demand pattern that you're seeing in Asia?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Broadly speaking, I mean as you can appreciate, there's a lot that goes into this. As we've said, gas demand has grown at about 1.6% per year. LNG capacity will probably triple from 2010 to 2040. So you're seeing a general demand growth that's underpinning, obviously underpinning realizations. There are a lot of other country-level dynamics like alternatives, nuclear power, fuel switching from coal to gas, all those variables really play into this 1.6% per year that I mentioned.", "Operator", "Paul Cheng with Barclays has our next question.", "Paul Cheng", "Two questions if I could, if we're looking at your very sizable total resource which is over [indiscernible], do you have a rough estimate that what's the percentage of that resource base already passed all the regulatory hurdle and with today's technology will be able to produce and earn a 10% after-tax [indiscernible] way of return a $60 to $70 barrel price, any kind of color you can provide?", "Jeff Woodbury", "I would tell you, I'd actually think about it differently, Paul, and that the resource base is in various stages of development planning. Some assets clearly, as I indicated previously to Neil, some of those assets are currently on the table right now in development planning and pre-feed, some of the assets are probable reserves in our possible or static resources or under various stages of development planning in order to ensure that we are defining the most attractive returns for those resources. And some, we make it to the point, Paul, that we have a better alternative to monetize, that may include divestment. But it's a dynamic resource base that is constantly being upgraded with new additions, pulling things out that we don't see as creating a value for the Corporation.", "And I'll give you one example by way of illustration. You think about the sizable Julia resource and how we've optimized that to a much smaller initial development in order to de-risk the overall resource size, that's the type of optimization that I'm talking about and based on that derisking it will there position us on future investment opportunities.", "Paul Cheng", "Great. Second question, just some quick number, I think in a number of segments that you have some asset sales gain. Can you just give us what is the asset sales gain in the second quarter by segment and breakdown between U.S. and international and also tell us what is the Kearl current production in Phase 1 and Phase 2 separately?", "Jeff Woodbury", "So in terms of the earnings impact from our asset sales in the second quarter, it was about $490 million. A majority of that, Paul, was in the Chemical business. In terms of Kearl, it's in total as I said is producing about 130 \u2013 or in the second quarter it was producing about 230,000 barrels per day. The Phase 1 or the initial development was around 100,000 barrels and Phase 2 was around 30,000 barrels.", "Paul Cheng", "Jeff, do you have the latest number in July in the last couple, maybe a week or so, on Kearl?", "Jeff Woodbury", "On Kearl, no, I don't have anything to share at this point.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Roger Read with Wells Fargo.", "Roger Read", "Guess one question hasn't really been asked I'd like to get out there, oil prices this low, last time we had sustained lower for longer situation, lot of mergers in the space. I know you don't want to talk about anything specific but as a general sort of commentary on maybe the bid ask spread that's out there, the type of assets that might be interesting to axe on, if you could give us any clarity on that?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Roger, that was similar to an earlier question. As I said earlier, I would just say that we keep alert to where we've got value propositions, and the way I clarify that is, you know bolt-on acquisitions that have natural synergies with our business, long-life assets that we think that our expertise in operating experience will bring intrinsic value associated with it, it's not focused on a specific resource type but it's really focused on where we think that our unique experiences can add value that others can't see.", "Roger Read", "And on the bid ask spread, maybe how that's \u2013 if it's changed at all, if there's anything you can add there?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Roger, I really don't have much to add on there. I mean that's really a function of the transactions. I mean that certainly staying in a lower price environment is going to encourage both buyers and sellers to find closure.", "Roger Read", "Okay. And then as kind of the unrelated follow-up, in Guyana the big discovery, is there any sort of timeline at all we can be thinking about at this point for the next appraisal well and then if that goes, how you think about some of the other things including the I guess border dispute with Venezuela, et cetera?", "Jeff Woodbury", "As I said, we're certainly very encouraged by the first well. It is one well in a very, very large block. We are currently evaluating that well and we're laying out, if you will, the plans moving forward. You can expect the intent for us to not only further appraise the discovery but pursue other opportunities on the block.", "I want to be clear though that we follow all the laws within the host countries and international law, that we're operating on this block on a license from the government at Guyana, and the border matters are really a function or should stay with the governments to address through appropriate channels.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.", "Ryan Todd", "Maybe if I could one follow-up on costs, I know you've talked about cost control efforts a couple of times already, but maybe not on the CapEx side but if we look on the OpEx side or the expense side of the Company, a lot of your competitors have talked about percentages in terms of year-over-year decreases and OpEx or targets in terms of absolute numbers that they think they can pull out of the business, I mean any guidance you can give us in terms of maybe where your cost structure might be year on year or how much you think you might be able to pull out on relative to the 2014 basis?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Obviously our objective is to make sure that we're capturing all those opportunities, both structural and market out there, and at the same time ensuring that we maintain the high integrity of our operations. I think, Ryan, the ultimate measure here is our industry-leading unit cost performance that we've seen over the last several years, and while it's still early I don't want to go too far with this. We are seeing the unit cost on a downward trend year-to-date, almost 9% down from where we were last year, but that's about as far as I'll quantify at this point. Obviously this is a key element to ensuring that we remain a leader in unit profitability as well.", "Ryan Todd", "Good, thank you. And maybe one question on LNG and thoughts over on the business, we've had a number of questions on spot pricing and trends, but if you look at \u2013 you've got a decent queue of potential development projects that could happen at some point over time, can you talk about maybe what would be the threshold that you would need to move forward on some of these projects? Is it local permitting, is it an effort on reducing costs in the industry and getting costs down to a place that's competitive, is it a wide bid ask spread between buyers and sellers right now, any thoughts in general I guess on your asset portfolio on LNG on the development side and what you're seeing in the market?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Sure. Broadly speaking, as you know, LNG is a key component of our portfolio and it's an important part of our margin generation. As I said earlier, we've got a very good inventory and including in that inventory is a number of LNG projects and it's all based on our assessment. As I indicated that gas will grow by about 1.6% per year between now and 2040 and more specifically LNG demand will triple from 2010 to 2040. So that is the value proposition we're pursuing. We've got a number of projects moving forward concurrently. We're going to be very selective in what we invest in.", "To your question about what does it take to make it go forward, it's all the things you mentioned, it's making sure that we get a competitive cost structure, that we've got stable transparent fiscal terms to underpin a very capital intensive investment, and that's why we're progressing settlement at the same time. I would tell you that kind of the brownfield type expansions are probably going to be the lowest cost LNG add.", "By way of example, our Papua New Guinea project, just a phenomenal outcome, started up ahead of schedule, very, very good reliability, very well-positioned to compete in expansion should we identify sufficient resource, having the assets that we have in the U.S. positions us very well, Alaska, West Coast of Canada continue to progress. Those opportunities will require more of what we were talking about in terms of cost, in terms of fiscal terms, regulatory environment. So in short, what I'd say, Ryan, is that the demand projection is there, obviously we've got the capability to participate in that and we're very well-positioned with a very good inventory of high quality opportunities to meet that demand growth.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.", "Brad Heffern", "Just looking at the Downstream business, there have been a lot of press reports and/or regulatory filings about a potential substantial expansion of Beaumont. I was wondering if you could comment on that, provide any color around the thinking there?", "Jeff Woodbury", "So just again, taking a portfolio look, Brad, we regularly evaluate our assets, our various business lines for where we can grow earnings or optimize the long-term value of it, and in the Downstream business it's focused in the following areas; expanding our logistics, expanding our feedstock, reducing our overall cost structure, and importantly increasing high-value product yields. You'll see that one of those areas or one or more of those areas will underpin the investment projects that we have communicated have been through FID, such as the [indiscernible] investment.", "As it pertains to Beaumont, we typically assess those activities. I understand that that may include some discussions with the regulators. It doesn't indicate that we have made a decision and when we get close to an FID and we've made that decision, we'll communicate that accordingly.", "Brad Heffern", "Okay, I understood. And then looking in California on the Upstream side, I was curious what the impact during the quarter was given the planned pipeline downtime and what the outlook is there?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Good question, Ryan. I mean as you all know, the planned All American Pipeline was down due to a failure of the line in the second quarter. We've looked for options to go ahead and keep our facility on without that pipeline running or until we are able to find an alternative export route as while it will be shut down. Before it was shut down, it was producing somewhere around 30,000 barrels a day. In fact that was a 2014 number. So we'll keep focused on it, we'll keep working with the regulator as well as the All American Pipeline to identify the earliest restart.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Anish Kapadia with Tudor, Pickering & Holt Co.", "Anish Kapadia", "First question is, just looking at some of the great projects again that surpass 2018, it seems to me like you focused on three key areas or things if you like which is getting more challenged over the next few years, so when you look at international LNG, seems to be a little more competition coming in from domestic U.S. LNG. When you look at your oilsands projects, they are relatively high cost and impacted by potential carbon pricing and higher taxes coming through. In Nigeria, clearly a difficult political environment there and tax uncertainty. Just wondering, given those as kind of your key areas, how comfortable are you with those areas and the potential growth there?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Anish, we're in the risk management business. Everything that we do has a level of risk that we've got to judge, whether it would be geopolitical risk, economic risk, technical uncertainty, and that is the world we live in, and I think the organization has demonstrated over the years that it's got the expertise and the capabilities to take on these more challenging resources and convert them into value propositions for our shareholders.", "So the areas you talked about, I mean take a look at Papua New Guinea LNG, I mean no infrastructure, we were able to build that into a very successful project that's going to supply an important part of LNG demand in the future. We have a good track record in all these areas, we're very good at capturing the learnings and transporting those learnings into our future resource development activities to make sure that we maximize return, and as I said to Paul earlier, if we don't see the value proposition there, we will find other ways to monetise that asset,", "Anish Kapadia", "Okay, great. And just a follow-on, in terms of your future projects, I'm just thinking, how you think about delaying projects in an attempt to in this kind of falling kind of service price environment to capture lower prices, is that something that you're actively kind of looking to do or would you just go ahead with the projects as it kind of make sense in terms of the economics at the moment?", "Jeff Woodbury", "I mean remember these projects that you referenced earlier are multi-year projects, they happen over a period of time and we are looking for not only the market savings but I'll stress again the structural savings. Let me use an example of what I'm talking about. We went forward with both the Arkutun-Dagi and the Hebron developments concurrently because we saw a very consistent development option and the tremendous benefit that we'd get by learning curve advantages.", "So both GBS, we used a comparable design shop for both of them, we used the same GBS contractor, we used the same topside contractor, and we captured that immediate learning curve benefit. On top of that, in a lower price cycle as I said earlier, we're very well positioned with the global procurement organization to be first in line in capturing those market savings, and given our long-term investment and our expectation of what demand is going to do, we're very confident that over the timeframe \u2013 the things we're investing in today, some of them we won't see production on for five or 10 years. We're very confident in our demand projections, in our ability to turn that into accretive financial performance.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.", "Paul Sankey", "When I hear what you're saying about costs and potential M&A, and knowing what you said in the past about the Permian, it feels like that's the best opportunity for you to combine the overlap that you have with the potential to drive out costs. I think you've highlighted that it's a very fragmented zone. And I would also think that the Bakken is similar. But you really don't have a lot in the Eagle Ford. So my assumption is that essentially the Permian would be the most attractive place for you and then the Bakken to take advantage of this low price environment.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Paul, just broadly speaking, we keep focused globally and we've got those type of opportunities in other countries that will naturally maintain a line of sight on should the right value proposition come forward. If you want to focus in them, conventional, certainly the ownership structure in the Permian by way of example is very, very diverse and where we can find natural synergies. I mean over the last several years we've made a number of bolt-on acquisitions that have increased our position there and you get a value uplift when we're able to do that where it's within our operational structure.", "Paul Sankey", "Yes, and I guess the operational structure is well suited because of the XTO separate division you have gives you the flexibility?", "Jeff Woodbury", "That's correct.", "Paul Sankey", "One thing I'm worried about, Jeff, is with the replacement, just in as far as I don't think you've had any FIDs this year, [indiscernible] just that your business bookings last year were heavily dominated by the U.S., could you update us on where we stand as regards with those replacements?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Obviously that's an annual process and we've fully replaced our production for 21 straight years. We've got a very good inventory that we're working on to convert to an FID decision and proved reserves as well as very active exploration program. So we've been very successful as the history shows and I'd say that the prognosis in the future will remain the same.", "Paul Sankey", "Jeff, do you know how many FIDs you had last year?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Not off the top of my head, Paul, no.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Alastair Syme with Citi.", "Alastair Syme", "Thanks for your comment on operating costs earlier. Can you give us some sort of magnitude about how much of that 9% you might feel is natural deflation in the environment, like energy prices, and how much is your in cost management?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Alastair, I'd just tell you that the organization wants to keep focused on the structural improvements as well as net market capture. Everything is under focus constantly, even when we're at $100 per barrel, but I don't have any specific numbers to breakout on the benefit today.", "Alastair Syme", "And secondly, in the Chemicals business in this environment, you've seen that difference in the profitability between the base and derivative businesses?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Remember it's all premised under very strong demand growth and our investments are strategically placed in order to make sure that we can compete competitively over that timeframe. I think we're very well-positioned in both the commodity and specialties markets.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Guy Baber with Simmons & Company.", "Guy Baber", "Jeff, you highlighted on Slide 18, Lower 48 onshore F&D cost, best in class by a substantial margin. I believe those costs have been declining in recent years as well and likely continue to decline. So I was just wondering if you could discuss how that positive trend for U.S. Lower 48 F&D compares to the trends that you're seeing internationally and that you've seen in recent years, where it appears F&D for the industry has risen considerably in some cases. So can you just discuss your thoughts on that emergence, what you're seeing, and also how that might influence capital allocation and strategy long-term, so specifically does it leads you to believe you need to find a way to allocate more capital to the regions where you can most efficiently add reserves, which appears to be the U.S.?", "Jeff Woodbury", "I think it's an excellent question, Guy, because I think this is just one example of what we do across our whole global portfolio. I talked about by way of another example, we've shown you the XTO example. In my prepared comments, I talked about Erha North Phase 2. Last quarter I talked about the start-up of Kizomba Satellites Phase 2, but that's another really good example that instead of \u2013 that we sequenced the resource development in a manner that we can fully leverage the fixed investment over a period of time, and what that does is that lowers our overall cost structure or E&D costs globally, and in a deepwater environment where we've got to be very careful that we've got very good execution plans and that we execute flawlessly.", "So it's a very strong focus across the world whether it's in the deepwater with Kizomba Satellites Phase 2 and Erha North Phase 2 or we're talking about the Arctic or sub-Arctic like in Arkutun-Dagi and Hebron, there is an ongoing emphasis to try to get that cost structure down. And that's why I made the point earlier that this is something that we have to work 365 days a year, it's not something that's driven by the price environment, it's driven by the need to be ever more productive and to compete in a market that you know there's a lot investment dollars going in. So we keep line of sight on where we've got cost opportunities.", "Guy Baber", "Thanks Jeff. And last one for me, liquids production up 12% on the year, so obviously very impressive growth, major projects ramping up, you get some PSC benefit obviously, but it also appears like you're showing growth in some areas where you don't have high-profile major projects, North Sea oil for example, but it appears that reliability uptime maybe improving just across the portfolio. Is that an accurate observation and is there any detail you can provide of how the base level of production is performing perhaps relative to expectations coming into the year because it seems to be doing better?", "Jeff Woodbury", "It's another good question and you may recall back in the Analyst presentation, we spent a little bit of time, the Chairman showed a chart that tries to \u2013 goes to quantify the volume add that we make with our focus on reliability. We are making very significant gains on improving overall operating reliability, and I'll emphasize, not only in the Upstream but also across our manufacturing business as well. As we focus intensely on cost structure, we do the same on uptime and reliability, and really try to transfer those learnings quickly across the Corporation to make sure that once again we're best in class.", "Operator", "Our final question for today comes from John Herrlin with Societe Generale.", "John Herrlin", "Most things have been asked here but you've seen a lot of your [IFC] [ph] peers as well as some large cap E&Ps take significant impairments. You have a very robust resource base, as you've stated. Are there any issues for say intermediate-term projects coming off the books on a long-term basis for Exxon?", "Jeff Woodbury", "There's two parts to your question. One is, if we've got resources that are in a resource base that ultimately we don't see the long-term value, as I indicated earlier, John, we will look for ways to monetize them which may include some level of divestment. In terms specifically of impairments, as you know we live in a commodity price environment that has great volatility but as I've said several times in our energy outlook, the long-term market fundamentals remain unchanged, and the lifespan of our assets are measured really in decades, therefore our long-term price views are more stable and quite frankly more meaningful for future cash flows and market value. So we expect the business to more than recover the carrying value of the assets on the books. Obviously in the course of our ongoing asset management efforts, we do confirm that asset values fully cover carrying costs.", "John Herrlin", "Great, that's what I wanted to hear. One last one for me, which you probably won't answer, Guyana insignificant, you want to attach a volume sense to that?", "Jeff Woodbury", "John, I think it's just too early. I look forward to that done, I can have more discussion about it as well, but as I said John, one well in a 6.6 million acre block, it's a very good start and just watch that space. There's more to be said there I think.", "Operator", "With no further questions in the queue, I'd like to turn the call back to our host for any additional or closing remarks.", "Jeff Woodbury", "To conclude, again I want to thank you for your time and your very thoughtful and insightful questions this morning. We appreciate the opportunity to talk about the business and really share the successes of our people that work day in and day out to make sure that we're creating shareholder value. So thanks again and we look forward to further discussion in the future.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call.

Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC", "Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International", "Operator", "Good day, everyone, and welcome to this ExxonMobil Corporation third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and once again welcome to ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website.", "And as you know, before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement, shown on slide two.", "Turning now to slide three, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our performance. ExxonMobil generated earnings of $4.2 billion in the third quarter. We maintain a relentless focus on our business fundamentals, including cost management, regardless of the commodity price cycle. Despite the challenging environment, the corporation also continues to deliver on its investment and operating commitments.", "Third quarter results reflect cyclical strength in our downstream and chemicals segments and highlight the resilience of our integrated business model. The corporation's integrated cash flows underpin our dividend and enable investment through the cycle to grow shareholder value. Year to date, the corporation generated cash flow from operations and asset sales of $27.6 billion, with positive free cash flow of $7.4 billion, even amid sharply lower commodity prices.", "Moving to slide four, we provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Global economic growth slowed during the third quarter. In the U.S., growth tapered following a strong second quarter. China's economy continued to decelerate, and the recovery in Japan remained weak. However, there is some evidence of economic stabilization in Europe. Crude oil prices resumed their decline after improving in the second quarter, whereas global refining margins strengthened during the quarter. And in chemicals, both commodity and specialty product margins also improved.", "Turning to the financial results, as shown on slide five, as indicated, third quarter earnings were $4.2 billion, or just over $1.00 per share. The corporation distributed $3.6 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. And of that total, $500 million were used to purchase shares. CapEx was $7.7 billion, benefiting from ongoing capital efficiencies as well as additional captured savings in the current market environment. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $9.7 billion. And at the end of the quarter, cash totaled $4.3 billion, and debt was $34.3 billion.", "The next slide provides more detail on sources and uses of funds. So over the quarter, cash decreased marginally from $4.4 billion to $4.3 billion. Earnings adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items, and our ongoing asset management program yielded $9.7 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included net investments in the business of $6.2 billion and shareholder distributions of $3.6 billion. There was no net cash flow impact from debt and other financing items. As you can see on the chart, the corporation fully funded all shareholder distributions and net investments with cash flow from operations and asset sales in the quarter, with a marginal decrease to the cash balance.", "Moving on to slide seven for a review of our segmented results, ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings were down $3.8 billion from the year-ago quarter, though our upstream earnings were partially offset by stronger downstream results and lower corporate costs.", "As shown on slide eight, the results were comparable to the second quarter, as lower upstream earnings offset stronger downstream results and lower corporate costs. Now on average, corporate and financing expenses are anticipated to be $500 million to $700 million per quarter over the near term.", "Turning now to the upstream financial and operating results, starting on slide nine, upstream earnings in the third quarter were $1.4 billion, down $5.1 billion from the third quarter of 2014. Sharply lower commodity prices reduced earnings by $5.1 billion, while crude realizations declined more than $50 per barrel, and gas was down more than $2.00 per 1,000 cubic feet. Note that favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings $110 million, driven by new project developments. All other items reduced earnings by $70 million, where the absence of asset management gains were partly offset by lower operating expenses.", "Moving to slide 10, oil equivalent production increased 87,000 barrels per day or 2.3% compared to the third quarter of last year. Liquids production increased 266,000 barrels per day or nearly 13%, driven by project ramp-up and entitlement effects. Natural gas production decreased 1.1 billion cubic feet per day due to regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and field decline, primarily in North America.", "Turning now to the sequential comparisons, starting on slide 11, upstream earnings were $673 million lower than the second quarter. Weaker liquids realizations reduced earnings $1.2 billion, as crude prices were over $12 per barrel lower than the second quarter. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings $30 million. All other items increased earnings $550 million, reflecting favorable foreign exchange effects, lower operating costs, and the absence of the deferred tax adjustment associated with the Alberta tax rate increase. Upstream unit profitability for the third quarter was $3.88 per barrel excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes. Year-to-date earnings per barrel were $5.81.", "Moving to slide 12, sequentially volumes decreased 61,000 oil equivalent barrels per day or 1.5%. Liquids production, however, increased 40,000 barrels per day, as new project growth and work programs were partly offset by scheduled maintenance and field decline. Natural gas production was 604 million cubic feet per day lower than the second quarter, driven by entitlement effects, weaker seasonal demand in Europe, and field decline.", "Moving now to the downstream financial and operating results, starting on slide 13, downstream earnings for the quarter were $2 billion, up $1 billion compared to the year-ago quarter. Our margins increased earnings by $1.4 billion. Volume and other impacts reduced earnings $280 million and $110 million respectively, primarily driven by higher maintenance activity, mostly in the U.S.", "Turning to slide 14, sequentially downstream earnings were up $527 million. Stronger margins increased earnings by $320 million, and higher volumes from lower maintenance activity contributed another $270 million. Other items reduced earnings by $60 million.", "Moving now to the chemical financial and operating results, starting on slide 15, third quarter chemical earnings of $1.2 billion were comparable to the prior-year quarter. Improved margins contributed $210 million. Favorable volume and mix effects added $30 million. And all other items decreased earnings by $210 million, largely due to unfavorable foreign exchange effects.", "Moving to slide 16, chemical earnings were also flat sequentially. Stronger margins increased earnings $160 million, while favorable sales mix added $40 million. Other items reduced earnings $220 million, reflecting the absence of asset management gains.", "Now on slide 17, we want to reinforce the importance of the corporation's focus on business fundamentals regardless of commodity prices, and this focus underpins our solid financial and operating results throughout the business cycle. Our first imperative is operational integrity, ensuring safe, efficient, and environmentally responsible operations, founded on strong risk management.", "Next, we work to maximize the value of our assets by increasing facility utilization and reliability. An incremental barrel of oil produced or refined through improved reliability is one of the most profitable.", "The next imperative is cost management. Reducing our cost structure is an ongoing focus in our existing operations and new developments. We also continuously enhance and right-size our global functional organization, capturing benefits from economies of scale, shared research and development programs and technologies, shared services, and common best practices. We currently run ExxonMobil with about the same number of employees as Exxon had just prior to the merger with Mobil.", "We are also quick to capture market cost savings. Our global procurement organization is dedicated to capturing the lowest lifecycle costs for goods and services. As you can see in the chart on the left, we are achieving significant market savings in the current business climate. So far this year, we've achieved a net reduction of $8 billion in capital and cash operating costs. And I'll note that this amount is in addition to the $4.5 billion decrease in planned 2015 CapEx relative to 2014 spend. Further in the upstream, unit costs are down about 10% year to date compared to last year.", "And finally, our longstanding track record of superior project execution is a distinguishing characteristic of ExxonMobil, and results in higher-return capital-efficient assets due to a lower capital base and on-time delivery.", "Turning to slide 18, through our differentiated project development capability, we are unlocking the value of our deep and diverse upstream portfolio. Excellent progress has been made on our investment plans to start up 32 major projects between 2012 and 2017. We've started up 21 of these projects, including five this year, which added more than 750,000 oil equivalent barrels per day of working interest production capacity. More than 90% of these volumes are liquids or liquids linked to LNG.", "We are achieving a strong reliability from our projects, including more recent startups such as Kizomba Satellites Phase 2 in Angola, Hadrian South in the Gulf of Mexico, and the Kearl expansion in Canada. The Papua New Guinea LNG project continues to achieve exceptional results. From its early startup in 2014 and quick ramp up to full capacity, the project has produced nearly 9 million gross tons of high-quality LNG and has delivered more than 125 cargoes to customers.", "Now since startup, we have progressed low-cost debottlenecking activities to enhance production rates. Our systematic approach has increased gross capacity of the PNG LNG project from 6.9 million to 7.3 million tons per year. This is yet another example of ExxonMobil's constant focus on maximizing the value of installed capacity and improving profitability.", "Two additional capital-efficient projects were commissioned in September. In Nigeria, Erha North Phase 2 started up five months ahead of schedule and $400 million under budget. This subsea development ties back to existing infrastructure, shown in the photo, avoiding the need for another FPSO vessel. Gross peak production is estimated at 65,000 barrels of oil per day and will increase total Erha North field production to approximately 90,000 barrels per day.", "Also in September, the first ever subsea compression facility started up at \u00c5sgard in the Norwegian North Sea at a depth of nearly 1,000 feet. This is a prime example of developing and applying advanced technologies to unlock previously uneconomic reserves. At peak, the project is expected to add gross production of approximately 40,000 barrels of oil and more than 400 million cubic feet of gas per day.", "And finally in Indonesia, at the Banyu Urip development, startup of the central processing facility is expected by year end, enabling gross production to ramp up to more than 200,000 barrels per day.", "Moving now to exploration on slide 19, we continue high-grading our 92 billion barrel resource base through new opportunity captures and leveraging the benefits of a softer market as we progress our exploration activities. Offshore Guyana, we are conducting the largest 3-D seismic survey in the company's history to evaluate the resource potential of the 6.6 million acre Stabroek Block. Additional exploration drilling is planned in the first half of 2016.", "Offshore Nigeria, we secured interests in two high-potential blocks, building upon our 800,000 acre position. These blocks are adjacent to where we made two discoveries last year. Future developments could tie back to the nearby Usan FPSO, which is operated by ExxonMobil.", "And in the U.S. Permian, we acquired rights to 48,000 acres in the core of the Midland Basin adjacent to existing operations. We have grown our operated portfolio in the basin to over 135,000 net acres from a series of acquisitions during the last two years.", "Turning to slide 20 and an update on our downstream business, where we are selectively investing to grow higher-value product sales, we recently announced the expansion of our hydrocracker unit at the Rotterdam refinery, shown in the picture to the left. The project will utilize ExxonMobil's proprietary hydrocracking technology, efficiently producing Group II premium lube-based stocks and ultra-low-sulfur diesel to meet growing market demand.", "The Rotterdam refinery is fully integrated with our chemical manufacturing. The hydrocracker project will increase production of higher-value products and further strengthen the refinery's position as a leader in the European refining industry. Construction is expected to begin in 2016, with startup projected in 2018. This project along with recently completed basestock capacity expansions at our Baytown, Texas and Singapore refineries will further enhance our position as the world's largest producer of lube-based stocks.", "Now in addition to these capacity expansions, we are investing across our lubricants value chain. At our petrochemical complex in Singapore, we announced the construction of a new synthetic lubricant blending plant to extend the production of Mobil 1, our flagship synthetic engine oil brand. This new plant will employ innovative blending technologies, drive increased operating efficiency, and enable us to support the growing Asian market demand for premium synthetic lubricants. Startup has been planned in 2017.", "Moving now to a discussion of year-to-date cash flow on slide 21, this graphic illustrates the corporation's sources and uses of cash. Our integrated businesses provided $26 billion of cash flow from operations, which supports shareholder distributions and funds our investments. The scale of these cash flows and our balance sheet strength provide the financial flexibility to invest through the cycle. Cash flow from operations and asset sales of $27.6 billion funded shareholder distributions and nearly all of our net investments in the business, supplemented by a small increase in debt financing. These investments have attractive financial returns and justify the additional leverage.", "Our objective is to pay a reliable and growing dividend, directly sharing the corporation's success with our shareholders. Quarterly dividends per share of $0.73 are up 5.8% versus the third quarter of 2014.", "We have also maintained the share buyback program, but have prudently tapered it over the past nine months, consistent with changes in the business environment and the corporation's cash requirements. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to remain at $500 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.", "And finally, year to date, the corporation has generated $7.4 billion free cash flow, reflecting the performance of our integrated businesses and our disciplined capital allocation approach.", "So I would now like to conclude this morning's comments with just a summary of our year-to-date performance. In short, the corporation is delivering on its investment and operating commitments. Through the end of the third quarter, ExxonMobil earned $13.4 billion, reflecting the benefits of our integrated business model, which captures value throughout the cycle, as demonstrated by our strong downstream and chemical results.", "Upstream production volumes increased to 4 million oil equivalent barrels per day, up 2.7% year on year. Volume contributions from a portfolio of new developments underscore our project execution excellence and reputation as a reliable operator. We remain on track to achieve our production target of 4.1 million barrels per day for the full year, with additional project ramp-up and seasonal gas production increases throughout the fourth quarter.", "Solid operating results combined with continued investment and cost discipline generated cash flow from operations and asset sales of $27.6 billion and free cash flow of $7.4 billion.", "Our commitment to shareholders remains strong, as the corporation distributed $11.5 billion through the end of the third quarter. So regardless of industry conditions, we remain focused on what we control and are driven to create shareholder value through the cycle.", "This concludes my prepared remarks, and I certainly would be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Woodbury. Our first question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you, everyone. Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Good morning, Doug.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "A couple, one housekeeping and one strategic question, if I may. Just on housekeeping. This quarter I guess the number that jumped out to us was your tax rate, and I'm just trying to understand. Is that just a mix effect, or is there anything thing unusual going on there that we should be aware of? Put another way, if we had a sustained low oil price environment, I'm guessing we would expect that the tax rate would remain at depressed levels. Is that fair?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Yeah, well, the tax rate, if you think about it from a quarter-on-quarter perspective, Doug, it's down just shy of 12%, and there are two components. One, as you said, is the mix effect across our business segments and geographies, same as what you've heard from us the prior quarters. There was also a one-time tax-related item that reduced the tax rate by about 3%. So we're still consistent with our guidance that assuming the current commodity prices and our existing portfolio mix, we would anticipate an effective tax rate between 35% and 40%. If you unwind the 3% one-time impact in the third quarter, that takes you up to 35%. And if you look at year to date, our effective tax rate is about 37%. So our guidance of 35% to 40% is right on.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "To be clear, that's a consolidated rate, or does that include affiliates? That's just consolidated, right?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "That's consolidated.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it, okay. My follow-up is I guess I'm going to go with Guyana. So one of your partners is suggesting that there's a reasonable potential for an early production system here, and I'm just wondering. Given as operator, you're the source of all knowledge, so to speak, can you give us some idea as to how you're thinking internally about scale opportunity given just the embryonic nature of this whole situation? Although there's an early production system plan, and I know there are a lot of embedded questions there. But the relative importance that Exxon is giving this within your general portfolio in terms of personnel allocation and things of that nature, just a broad feel as to how you're thinking about what looks like a fairly interesting area. I'll leave it there, thanks.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Sure, Doug. Let me step back first and just remind you. The exploration program as a whole is really designed to ensure that we're targeting opportunities that will high-grade our resource portfolio. As you heard from us earlier this year, we're very encouraged with the initial result of Guyana. As I've said previously, Doug, and as you seemed to imply, we've got one well in an area that's very large, 6.6 million acres. We're very encouraged by the initial results. As I said in my prepared comments, we do have a very active seismic program underway that is informing us as we put together our plans for some drilling activity in the first half. Obviously, we're taking all that information real time and we're incorporating it into our thinking. But it is really too early for us to share any specific plans. But rest assured, Doug. We will look at the full range of development options to see how we can best monetize the resource with the objective of achieving optimized return on investment.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, Jeff. I appreciate the answer.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "You bet.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI.", "Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Good morning, Doug.", "Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI", "So I have a point of clarification as well. What was the asset sale that was highlighted on slide six? And was this $500 million after-tax amount included in the operating earnings; that is, in the $1.01 per share?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "So the $500 million from cash flow represents a number of multiple assets. As we've said historically, Doug, we have as part of a key component of our business is a very active asset management plan to high-grade our portfolio.", "Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI", "Sure.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "So the $500 million positive cash impact really represents many different transactions that occurred over the quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, it was the absence of a trade that we did third quarter of last year.", "Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI", "Okay, I see. And also on capital spending, it's running about 20% below last year's level. And while the gap seems to have narrowed somewhat versus the recent quarters, it actually widened versus the first half in the upstream. So my question is whether or not you could provide some color on the spending trends and also any insight that you may have on the trend for 2016 in light of the pretty significant changes that are being announced by some of your competitors; that is, if you have any guidance at this point.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Sure, Doug. I'll say in short that our CapEx guidance has not been changed.", "Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI", "Okay.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "We're still saying \u2013 have guidance for this year at $34 billion, and 2016 and 2017 below $34 billion. Of course, we'll provide an update in the analyst meeting in March. But as I alluded to last quarter and you see in the savings I talked about year to date, we are seeing substantial capital efficiencies on the CapEx side. We are running lower than our plan, and it is reasonable to extrapolate that to a year-end number that will bring us below our $34 billion.", "Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI", "Okay.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "And thinking forward, Doug, I'd also say that those type of efficiencies and improvements that we're capturing, including market savings and a stronger U.S. dollar, will be extrapolated forward into the 2016 and 2017 programs.", "Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "You bet.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.", "Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Good morning, Brad.", "Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Just following up on the past question, obviously you identified $8 billion in cost savings so far. I'm curious what inning we're in, if you will, as far as cost savings go. Do you feel like you've harvested the majority of savings that you expect to have as a result of the downturn, or is there a lot more to come?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Brad, I think just stepping back, we are never satisfied with our cost structure. We are, as was clearly mentioned many times, we're always working to reduce the structural cost in our business. So I would never tell you that we're done. Within the market capture, the market benefits, we continue to work actively with our service providers to identify innovative lower-cost solutions that end up being win-win solutions outcomes because they know we've got the financial capability to invest if we have the right cost structure and ultimately the right economics. So we're actively pursuing additional opportunities, and our expectation is that we'll continue to drive meaningful improvement in our cost structure while maintaining high operational integrity.", "Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay, thanks for that. And then thinking about onshore U.S., can you talk about the current rig count across your three major basins? There was obviously a big decline last quarter. Can you talk through how much of \u2013 if it's declined further, how much of that is just pure efficiencies versus the amount of activity you'd like to have?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "It's probably both of that. It's both efficiency as well as an intentional effort to manage our spend given the business climate. Right now, currently we've got running about 32 rigs in our Lower 48 onshore rig activity. That is down from our peak. And you know, in essence, it's down because of the reasons I've already stated, and that is we continue to see significant improvements in operational performance, cost, and productivity. So while the rig count is down, part of that is offset by the improvement in performance. But the second part of it again is due to a deliberate effort to manage within our means.", "Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Great, thank you.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "You bet.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Hi, Evan.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Just first to follow up on the CapEx, on the $8 billion of cost savings year to date, can you give us color of the composition in that reduction between capital and cash costs? I thought I heard you say that's in addition to the $4.5 billion step-down from 2014 to 2015.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Yes, Evan. It is in addition to the $4.5 billion. So the $8 billion is really from our target, our CapEx guidance that we had provided. In terms of the split between CapEx and OpEx, generally speaking, I'd just tell you it's a little over $1 billion CapEx. The rest is OpEx, cash OpEx.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it; that helps as we think about 2016. And my second question is on LNG. I know there's a mix in contract durations within your global LNG portfolio, and it changes over time as contracts, some contracts reopen as had been reported. But can you quantify the aggregate spot market exposure in your portfolio for Exxon into 2016?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "I can generally tell you that it's a fairly low component of our portfolio. Remember, our LNG projects continue to be a key component of our portfolio, and it is a very important part of our margin generation. And as you may have heard us say in the past, when we go to FID on these big multibillion dollar complex LNG projects, we typically contract under long terms our LNG volumes, our proved LNG or proved reserves, with a very little bit left for spot.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "So less than 10%, is that a fair assumption?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "That's a fair assumption.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great, I appreciate it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.", "Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, Jeff. Good morning.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Good morning, Phil.", "Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Just a quick follow-up on the capital cost reduction number. Would you say that there has been a significant impact this year to pulling forward any capital spending to take advantage of this environment that as we look ahead to next year, you could actually have a good year-over-year benefit from that?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Yes, clearly the strength of our balance sheet and our ability to continue to invest through the cycle provides an added benefit. Those projects that are in execution right now coupled with the capability of our global procurement organization to capture market savings allows us to leverage those benefits in the current projects. Likewise, if you rewind a bit to our discussion around the Lower 48 unconventional activity, we are taking full advantage of high-grading the services that were provided. We're very well positioned to advance certain commodity purchases, but rest assured we're taking full benefit of the current market climate.", "Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Is there any way to quantify the benefit of pull-forward plus project roll-off?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "No, Phil, it's really hard to do that. The business is very expansive in terms of scope and scale. A lot of those cost savings vary dramatically between asset and geographic regions. So it's really difficult for us to go ahead and break that down further.", "Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, understood. And my follow-up question is just on the M&A bid/ask spreads. Other companies have sounded a bit more upbeat. I know in the past you've said you think they're too wide still. So has anything changed there in the past few months? And with respect to how wide they've been for how long, has that surprised you at all given where we are in the cycle relative to past cycles?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "All I can really say about it is as you would envision. The bid/ask price is really a function of a number of factors, obviously including the business climate. But also what I would tell you is the unique capability and assessment from individual investors. Certainly as commodity prices remain low, it will impact the dynamics. I really don't have a view to share with respect to where it's going. I would tell you from our perspective, it's business as normal. As you've heard me say several times, Phil, this is a key component of our ongoing business, not only acquisitions but high-grading our portfolio from divestments. I would simply just say that any acquisition will have to compete with our diverse inventory of investment opportunities.", "Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks, Jeff.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.", "Neil Singhvi Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Good morning.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Good morning, Neil.", "Neil Singhvi Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey, Jeff, I wanted you to comment a little bit on the downstream here. And maybe we start off with some of the announced divestments, Chalmette and Torrance. Talk through a little bit of the strategic logic behind divesting those assets, and then what we can read, if any, from how you think about the downstream portfolio as a percentage as the mix of the company.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Sure, Neil. Maybe I can start with just a reminder for the group that, as I said a moment ago, this is a very important part of our overall business activities, the asset management focus. And from a downstream perspective, if you look at the last decade, we have divested more than 1 million barrels a day of refining capacity, something like 6,000 miles of pipeline, and over 200 fuel terminals. And I start there because it just highlights that we continue to high-grade the portfolio. And it really talks to our effort towards enhancing our portfolio through identifying appropriate investment opportunities like you're seeing in Rotterdam, in Singapore, focusing on risk balancing on our portfolio, and then pursuing monetization opportunities.", "Obviously, there are a lot of variables that go into such a decision for the downstream, including our large manufacturing footprint in the U.S. But ultimately the right decision for us was to monetize those assets and to continue to focus our investments on areas that will upgrade our existing portfolio. Many of our sites being advantaged, a lot of those investments focused on things like expanding our feedstock flexibility, like you see in our plans to expand the Beaumont refinery, like expanding our logistics flexibility like we talked about previously with the Edmonton rail terminal. Expanding our higher-yield, higher-value products, which you're seeing with the Rotterdam refinery and the Antwerp refinery. And underlying all of that is further capturing increased value from our integrated business model.", "Neil Singhvi Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And then the follow-up question, Jeff, is a follow-up to Phil's question around M&A. And as you think about the U.S. unconventional business, you did a tuck-in here of 48,000 acres in the Permian. Is that the right strategy for Exxon to continue to look for incremental bolt-on acquisitions of acreage that you can tuck into the portfolio under XTO, or does larger-scale M&A of U.S. conventional assets create value at the right price?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "We think it is the right strategy. We think everything is available for us to consider. It will be a full range from our investment activity to the bolt-on acquisitions that you've seen us do here in the Lower 48 unconventional in the last two years, to larger-scale acquisitions where fundamentally it keeps on going back to that test. It has to compete with the investment opportunities that we have in our portfolio. And if the view is that we can capture additional strategic value, and overall our assessment is that we'll capture longer-term accretive performance, then it really sets up the stage for something that we'd be interested in. And remember, we keep that financial capability so that we are agile to respond to opportunities that come along.", "Neil Singhvi Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Makes sense. Thank you very much, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Neil.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi, good morning.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Good morning, Paul.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Jeff, two questions, if I may, one a quick one, just a clarification on the quarter. Maybe I missed it. Did you tell us what is the actual asset sales gain on the P&L in this quarter, and also whether there's any timing benefit value from the price realization for your downstream?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "On the first question, Paul, what I said was there really is \u2013 from an earnings impact, there's really nothing for us to share. There's nothing notable across the transactions. Your second question, can you repeat that again?", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "That's part of the first question, is that do you have \u2013 typically when you buy crude, because of the long haul, sometimes when oil price is dropping that you have a price realization benefit on the finalization.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Yes.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Do you have that number you can share with us?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Yes, so quarter on quarter it's a negative about $100 million. Sequentially, it's negative about $200 million.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "So sequentially it's about $200 million negative.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "That's correct.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "A second question is maybe more strategic. If I look at your portfolio, say broadly divide it into deepwater, oil sands, shale oil, and LNG, when you look at those buckets, can you rank for us that in terms of the attractiveness of future investment within your portfolio on those buckets? In other words, which one is weighing the highest, and which one is the lowest in your portfolio today?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Paul, I'd ask you to think about it a little bit differently; that within each one of those resource types, there is a range of attractiveness in terms of value. We may have some very attractive resources in each one of those categories that would compete very effectively with other high-value resources within another bucket. Quite frankly, what's really important here that I'd ask you to think about is that we have a very diverse and deep resource base that we are able to participate in each one of those resource categories. And within those resource categories, we've got very high-value investment opportunities that will effectively compete for allocation of capital.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yes, that's fair. Maybe let me ask from another angle then. Out of the 98 billion barrels of your resource, do you have a rough estimate how much of them based on today's technology and the physical term you would be able to generate more than a 10% return under a $60 Brent?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "On the 92 billion barrel resource base, again, I'd ask you think about it differently because what the organization does is we will continue to optimize our development alternatives to make sure that we maximize the return on these barrels.", "So if we identify a resource that we don't think we can get an attractive return on, there will be other means to go ahead and either implement a different development scheme that will reduce the economic risk and improve the return, or ultimately we may choose to go ahead and monetize the asset. So it's a dynamic portfolio that is really working towards getting the greatest value from every barrel. And then of course, we complement that with our application of technology. I'd just use the unconventionals as a good example about how technology has really increased the value of the unconventional resources. Another good example is in oil sands, how technology is being applied to really improve the profitability and allow us to capture greater value from those resources.", "So I think it really speaks to the strengths of ExxonMobil. We have the knowhow. We've got the excellence in how we go ahead and do our development planning, how we identify value-added real-time technology to enhance our investment choices, and then of course, leveraging our ability to interface with the resource owners to find the right fiscal environment to go ahead and progress the investments.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay, very good. Thank you.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Okay.", "Operator", "Sam Margolin with Cowen & Company has our next question.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Good morning.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Morning, Sam.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "So on the last call there was a little bit of inquiry about growth opportunities post this round of guidance in 2018. It strikes me that sort of U.S. gas is a really big component of your resource base without pulling much weight in income today, and perhaps there's an opportunity for that slug of resource to provide some of that outer year growth. I was wondering if you could just maybe walk us through your broader views on gas, specifically any kind of path you see for that tranche of production to start contributing a little bit more to the overall income profile.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Sure. Let's start, Sam, with our energy outlook. If you think about the energy outlook, gas is growing about 1.6% per year. From an LNG perspective, from where we are, say, 2010 to 2040, we expect LNG demand to triple from current capacity. So that really sets up, if you will, the investment case. And then globally, we're very well positioned with gas assets around the globe to participate not only in the domestic market but in the LNG market.", "So maybe if I can focus now on just the U.S. for a moment, we have had a constructive view that gas is going to continue to grow in the U.S. as gas replaces coal for power generation. Our gas resource base is also significantly underpinning our investment in our petrochemicals. So our expansion, for instance, at the Baytown refinery to add ethylene lines, 1.5 million tons per annum, as well as a concurrent investment at Mont Belvieu to add polyethylene lines, in fact, metallocene polyethylene, will be underpinned by an advantaged feedstock that is U.S. natural gas.", "And then furthermore, it also positions us to provide a source for LNG export into the global market. By way of example, we're progressing through a regulatory review of the Golden Pass LNG export facility. Think of it as a brownfield development because all the original investment associated with the export facility is going to be advantaging that site as we move forward into an export facility.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay, so that brings me to my follow-up, I guess. How much of your investment evaluation process is geared around integrating some of the resources that you have in place? So for example, as you see U.S. gas here get pressured in the near term from improved economics from unconventional producers, would that ever lead you to accelerate your investment in things like ethylene crackers or even U.S. LNG facilities to promote your own position?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "I think it's a good question, Sam. Think about it this way; that we will time the investment in gas resource development activities to underpin value chain opportunities that we're pursuing. That is expansion into petrochemicals. That would be the LNG export. We will time those resource development activities to underpin the value chain investments that we're pursuing.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Perfect, thank you very much.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Great. Thanks, Sam.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.", "Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil", "Jeff, hey. Good morning. Question for you, a lot of your peers have been recognizing impairments and restructuring charges I guess partially as a function of head count reductions and OpEx reductions, and then secondly resetting internal price decks. I was wondering if you could remind me. Is there a certain timeline that Exxon uses to reset the internal deck that they're using? And then secondly, with some of these operating cost reductions that you're seeing, is part of that head count related, in which case we may see some restructuring charges?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "We don't have any plans, Blake, to have any restructuring charges. As I said in the prepared comments, we have really focused on right-sizing the organization through our history. Particularly, if you reference the merger of Exxon and Mobil to where we are today, we're down over 30% in terms of total employees. So we are constantly right-sizing that organization and identifying additional opportunities to improve the productivity of the organization as a whole. So we don't anticipate any restructuring charges.", "Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil", "Okay. And it doesn't sound like there's a timeline on internal price forecasts or anything like that, like some companies use the third quarter or something like that.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "I'll go back to talking about our \u2013 what really informs us is our outlook on supply and demand.", "Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil", "Okay. Okay, the second question for you, very briefly, a lot of companies are starting to see lower decline rates as a function of increased reliability or some of the longer plateau projects coming online. This may be a better question for the Analyst Day, but I didn't know if you're witnessing the same thing in your portfolio.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Generally speaking, if you look at our 10-K, we have continued to update our, if you will, average decline rate over the long term, which is still about 3%. That does not include uplift due to major new project developments. But we have continued to invest in some very long-life assets that have really very long plateau production rates, like Kearl, like the LNG investments we've made in Papua New Guinea and in Qatar. That gives a very strong foundation to our production, but importantly, a valuable foundation that contributes significant cash flow.", "Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil", "Thanks a lot, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "You bet, Blake.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Anish Kapadia with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.", "Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP", "Hi. My question is going back somewhat to the industry cost-cutting and CapEx cutting that you're seeing, and it seems like some other companies are cutting a lot more aggressively than yourselves given the state that some of those companies' balance sheets are in. I was just wondering. On the back of that, when would you expect that to have some kind of an impact on your non-operated production, given that we might see higher decline rates coming through with the lower number of infill wells being drilled, less tie-backs being put into place as projects get canceled?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Anish, that's a hard one to answer in terms of what others are going to do that results in volume impacts on our non-operated. Recognize that a large part of our portfolio is driven by long-life investments. These are multi-decade investments that are generating volumes over the long term. Granted there is a material component that's much more shorter-cycle investments, and we have seen some of the assets where we are not the operator, the activity drop off significantly because of weaker balance sheets. Of course, that may present an opportunity for us.", "Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP", "Okay, thank you. My second question was on your U.S. gas production. It seems like it's been fairly weak this quarter. It's down around 9% year over year. I think you had some benefit with Hadrian coming onstream. I'm just wondering in terms of that trend and that decline rate. Can you just give some kind of outlook of how you see your U.S. gas production progressing, especially in the current oil and gas price environment, and how you expect the gas price environment to evolve? What does that mean for your U.S. gas production? Thank you.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "A large part \u2013 I will remind you that a large part of our gas is coming from our unconventional resources. We are the largest gas producer in the U.S. We have not been investing in drilling activity here very significantly, primarily given the outlook for near-term gas demand. And as I said earlier, we're going to pace the investment program consistent with expected demand growth for conversion from coal to natural gas in power gen, the investment in petrochemicals, the regulatory approvals needed in order to export that gas and compete in the LNG market. Unfortunately, given certain regulatory restrictions in the U.S., that does slow down the investment opportunities, and I think it really points to the opportunity the U.S. has to more actively participate in the global market.", "Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP", "That's great. Thank you.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "You bet.", "Operator", "Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank has our next question.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great, thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. Maybe I can do one higher-level one first. If we think about project sanctions and your investment in long-cycle projects right now, where do you think you are in the deferral or reinvestment process? Have you seen costs come down to a level at this point on long-cycle projects where you feel like it's time to reaccelerate investment? Have you not deferred much in your view at this point? Or probably I guess what have you seen on FIDs? What FIDs could you expect going forward, or do you think that costs need to come down further for you to get reengaged?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Ryan, I guess I would tell you that we haven't disengaged. We've maintained an active investment program. In addition to the 32 major upstream projects that I've talked about and then the financial \u2013 FID decisions that we've taken on some of our downstream and chemical projects, we've given you some line of sight on the next tranche of upstream investment opportunities that are currently in various stages of either development planning or even in the early stages of pre-engineering, if you will. It gives you a sense for what we're working on.", "I want to remind you that we are capturing real-time benefits through capital efficiency in our investment program. Those are structural improvements that we're capturing. Yes, there are market improvements that we're experiencing as well. But as we make the investment decisions, we test those investments across a very wide range of prices, including commodity prices, and that's well within the current price environment. So the investments are very robust, resilient to a number of factors that can significantly influence them, and that positions us very well to continue a continuous investment program, not get the inefficiencies of the stop and the starts, obviously underpinned by our financial capability, and allows us to further capture economic uplift in the current market climate.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great. Thanks, that's helpful, and then maybe if I could ask one more specific one. On the last quarter you provided a little bit more granular production levels on some of your onshore assets, where they were in the quarter in the Permian, the Bakken, the Woodford. Would you be willing to say what those assets produced in the third quarter and maybe what your Midland Basin acreage is up to at this point?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "So the Midland Basin acreage, as I said in the prepared comments, we're up to 135,000 net acres.", "In terms of production or total gross operated production from the Permian, Bakken, and Woodford is just shy of 250,000 barrels a day. Bakken is leading that at over 100,000 barrels a day. Permian is approaching 100,000 barrels a day, and the rest is in the Woodford.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay, thank you.", "Jeffrey J.

It's getting to the top of the hour, so I'll leave my contentious one for the second question. First one, you mentioned you picked up extra acreage in Nigeria. Any signs that Nigeria is moving forward in terms of changing terms to get those attractive reservoirs actually development-flowing?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "I think there's a clear recognition that there are some opportunities to stimulate further investment, technology application within the country. And I think there's an earnest effort to try to put in place the right investment climate. There is significant opportunity in Nigeria. And as we said in the prepared comments, we're encouraged by the exploration results that we've had. But we're just going to have to wait and see where it moves. There are a lot of issues that they're dealing with and we've got to be patient, but we've got make sure that we weigh in. But in short, I'd tell you that we're encouraged by the new government and where they're heading.", "Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "And this is a small but potentially contentious issue. Just I saw Asia gas volumes down, and I hear that Petronet in India is rejecting cargoes, or at least low on the take-or-pay commitments. Just maybe talk through, it's probably just a timing issue in terms of how that might affect volumes. But talk through about any issues with Asia gas that we should be aware of, just for modeling.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "I guess what you're referring to is on Asia gas that we're down sequentially. That's primarily due to some entitlement impacts associated with some quarterly true-ups as well as some decline in other impacts.", "With respect to LNG contracts, they're confidential, as you can appreciate. As I said earlier, all of our contracts are based on a longer time horizon.

At the same time, I'm seeing that you're consistently losing money in the U.S. C&P. The two, one is obviously long cycle; the other is short cycle. I was wondering in the short cycle case why you seem to be maintaining very high levels of activity when you've got nearly a $0.5 billion loss here and whether or not that's a function of perhaps oil profits being offset by natural gas losses, or if I'm missing something about the breakdown of that loss. Thanks.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "So let me give you a perspective of the upstream U.S. business. Paul, all of our assets are managed to maximize returns through the lifecycle, which is obviously on a longer time horizon than the current price environment.

Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "No, not at all. So I'll remind you...", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Based on the assumptions that efficiency gains will make it profitable in the future?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Based on factual current data that we've got and how we manage the portfolio as well as the existing operations.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "I guess what I'm looking at is maybe $0.5 billion dollar loss in U.S. C&P.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Right.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Will that become profitable in due course at these prices?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Again, we manage the business over a longer time horizon. And to be clear, our U.S. upstream portfolio continues to generate positive cash flow.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay, so it's positive cash. So what's the problem with the earnings then?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Again, Paul, we manage the business over the longer time horizon. And we'll continue to do what we do very well and manage the things that we control, continue to work on the operating costs and the reliability.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Yes, I understand. I'm just slightly digging around just because it's been a fairly consistent loss. And because it's short cycle, I think that's what I'm really driving at. I would have thought that it's a short cycle business, therefore the short-term performance might be better.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "The increase in the loss in the third quarter was primarily driven by another reduction in crude realizations that we all experienced as well as some additional downtime and maintenance.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Got it. Okay, thanks, Jeff. I'll leave it there, thank you.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "All right.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Jason Gammel with Jefferies.", "Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.", "Thank you. We're getting pretty long on the call, so I'm just going to keep it to one and hopefully be fairly quick. Jeff, can you confirm that the Iraqi government has asked you to slow investment at the West Qurna project? And can you comment whether you're now at peak capacity in Phase 1 of the project and whether you'll be able to hold that level if you're not investing?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "On the first point, Jason, I really can't talk about discussions between us and the government. Production has remained above about 400,000 barrels a day in the third quarter with continued pressure support, and that has grown over the recent past.", "Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.", "And do you expect that you'll be able to hold it at that level?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "It will be our intent to maintain production levels. Obviously, that's going to require continued investment and pressure maintenance.", "Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.", "Got it, thank you.", "Operator", "Roger Read with Wells Fargo has our next question.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Yeah, thanks, good morning.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Good morning, Roger.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "I guess maybe following one of the questions earlier from Ed, as you look at other countries where maybe they're becoming a little more reasonable, whether it's your tax structure, royalty structure, PSCs, et cetera, we've seen Canada raise taxes. We've had Nigeria stuck in neutral for a number of years. As you look across the rest of the globe, are there any places where we're seeing some adjustments from a political standpoint that might make things more attractive over the next couple of years?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "I think if you look at the globe across the full value chain for the energy sector, I would point to the progress being made in a number of places. One place is Mexico. Mexico has made significant progress opening up the door to investment. You think about some opportunities in West Africa that have opened up, East Africa.", "Now of course, when you open up a new area, there are a lot of other issues we've got to deal with because there's limited infrastructure, perhaps not a well established fiscal basis, so it does take more time. But nonetheless, I would tell you from an encouraging foreign investment that there's been some pretty good progress out there that's increased the amount of opportunities that we've got before us.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. And as a follow-up to that, you mentioned earlier in the M&A discussion that it had to compete with your internal opportunities. As you look at maybe a changing dynamic internationally and your exploration spending because I think of that as having to compete with the M&A side given the uncertainties and the longer timeframe, how is exploration spending keeping up with the overall spending reductions adjusted for efficiencies and all that? Is it going to remain a similar percentage of total CapEx? Does it need to decline in this environment? Just curious which direction you're going to go there.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Think about it as being more opportunity-driven. It's a function of the opportunities, the maturity of our resource assessments, and the appropriate timing to make the investment within our obligations to the resource owner.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "No percentages?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Nothing to quantify, it's a very large and extensive resource base that we're pursuing. But I will again remind you that it's solely focused on how it can high-grade our existing portfolio. So after we've done the assessments and we have a better handle on what the prospect potential is, it's got to be able to compete before we'd be spending more money there.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "All right, appreciate it. Thank you.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Okay.", "Operator", "We'll go next to John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.", "John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC", "Yeah, hi, two quick ones. How's Kearl going?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Well, thanks for asking, John. Kearl is moving along very nicely. As you heard, we got the Kearl expansion started up ahead of schedule. All the learnings have been fully integrated into the expansion project. It's ramping up quicker than initial development. And through the quarter, we produced in excess of 180,000 barrels a day gross. And I'll tell you that we have produced over the 220,000 barrels a day design.", "John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC", "Okay, great. Next one and last one for me is you're seeing a lot of your IOC brethren reduce their risk profiles. I think other people were getting at this. Are you at all worried in terms of your global portfolio or the world as a global portfolio of having fewer potential partners for these large-scale projects going forward, or is this an advantage because you execute well?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "I think a couple thoughts there. One is is that clearly we're in the risk management business. There's a lot of risks that we deal with, one of them being the geopolitical risks, another one being the economic risks associated with many multiyear investment programs on these big multibillion dollar investments. I wouldn't say that we're seeing a back-off on interest by our typical partners in these type of investments. I would say that there's clearly a desire for us to continue to be in a leadership role in a lot of these big investments. We think we've demonstrated our credibility, and I think that plays well not only with the resource owner but with the industry as a whole.", "John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "All right, John.", "Operator", "Our final question today comes from Guy Baber with Simmons.", "Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International", "Good morning, Jeff. Thanks for fitting me in here.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "You bet, Guy.", "Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International", "I wanted to talk a little bit about North America unconventional. But you've highlighted efficiency gains this year have been significant and the benefits from technology improvement. You obviously have a broad perspective across various plays in the Bakken, Woodford, Permian, and your gas plays. So could you just talk a little bit about which specific play you see the greatest potential for continued efficiency gains and technology application? Really just trying to get some differentiated thoughts by play in the U.S. in terms of what the current view might be and maybe how that's evolved over the last year or so.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "It's a really good question, Guy, in particularly the way you ended your question because it has truly evolved over the last several years. Our prominent acreage holdings are in the Bakken, Permian, and the Woodford. I would tell you that we're very, very excited about all those opportunities. Clearly, the Bakken is more advanced in terms of its development, although I would also say that we continue to capture additional cost and productivity improvements in the Bakken. The Permian has got multiple reservoir objectives, and I think that presents a unique opportunity to further optimize the value, probably more so than the Bakken. And the Woodford is very early stages, and it's really hard to compare and contrast at this point. But in summary, rather than saying one is better than the other, I'd tell you that they're all very exciting. They're all a very important part of our portfolio and have significant value uplift potential for us in the future.", "Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International", "Okay. Great, Jeff, and then last one for me. The international downstream business performance was very impressive obviously, but you earned more this quarter than all of last year combined. Can you talk about the fundamental margin outlook going forward for refining, particularly internationally? We've been surprised by the strength of that market this year. And maybe the same for chemicals, just given those businesses have done such a tremendous job this year of offsetting the weakness in oil prices, so it's important.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Yeah. Well, as you know, broadly speaking, refining margins are really a function of product demand and available refining capacity, not only new capacity adds but also rationalization of capacity in regions that have excess capacity. We do not provide a forward look on margins. But I would say that particularly in the non-U.S., you've seen really good strength in Europe, Asia very similar to the U.S., driven by Mogas. I think the results really underscore the strength of our integrated portfolio.", "Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International", "Thanks for the comments, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Okay.", "Operator", "With no further questions in the queue, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Woodbury for any additional or closing remarks.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President-Investor Relations", "To conclude, I again thank you all for your time and your questions, a very interesting period right now. I think you can see from ExxonMobil's performance that we continue to meet both our operating and our investment commitments. We are very focused on the fundamentals. We have always been focused on the fundamentals, and we have seen that as being a very important element on the success of this corporation. So thanks for your questions this morning, and we do appreciate your interest in ExxonMobil.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference.

Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International", "Operator", "Good day everyone and welcome to this Exxon Mobil Corporation Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome to Exxon Mobil's fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on slide two.", "Now turning to slide three, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our performance. Exxon Mobil generated full year earnings of $16.2 billion and fourth quarter earnings of $2.8 billion. These results reflect proven strategies that we've consistently applied for decades along with a relentless focus on the business fundamentals, including project execution and effective cost management. While our Upstream financial results reflect the challenging business environment, stronger performance in our Downstream and Chemical segments highlights the resilience of our integrated businesses.", "Exxon Mobil completed six major Upstream projects during the year. These new developments in Canada, Indonesia, Norway, the United States and West Africa added 300,000 oil equivalent barrels per day of working interest production capacity and contributed 3.2% volumes growth.", "Strong operating performance of the base portfolio along with these project efficients delivered full year production of 4.1 million oil equivalent barrels per day, consistent with our plans. The corporation's 2015 cash flow from operations and asset sales were $32.7 billion, with positive free cash flow of $6.5 billion despite sharply lower crude oil and natural gas prices.", "Moving to slide four, we provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Global economic growth continued to slow during the fourth quarter across nearly all major economies. In the US, estimates show growth softening further since the third quarter. In Asia, China continued to decelerate with significant volatility in the financial sector. And Japan experienced ongoing economic weakness, whereas Europe's economy remained stable with continued tempered growth.", "Crude oil prices extended declines on global oversupply conditions and natural gas prices moved lower, reflecting unseasonably warm weather through the quarter. Furthermore, global refining and chemical margins weakened due to lower seasonal fuels demand and decreased chemical realizations.", "Turning now to the financial results shown on slide five. As indicated, fourth quarter earnings were $2.8 billion or $0.67 per share. Corporation distributed $3.6 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $500 million was used to purchase shares. CapEx was $7.4 billion, down more than $3 billion from our fourth quarter of 2014. As a result of ongoing capital efficiencies, market savings, reduced activity and timely project delivery. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $5.1 billion and at the end of the quarter, cash totaled $3.7 billion and debt was $38.7 billion.", "The next slide provides more detail on sources and uses of cash. Total for the quarter cash decreased from $4.3 billion to $3.7 billion. Earnings adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items, and our ongoing asset management program, yielded $5.1 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales.", "The cash decrease from working capital changes includes both normal seasonality as well as the effect of the decline in crude prices on account balances and receivables and payables. Uses included net investments in the business of $6 billion and shareholder distributions of $3.6 billion. Cash flows were balanced over the quarter by increasing short-term borrowing by about $4 billion.", "Moving on to slide seven for a review of our segmented results. Exxon Mobil's fourth quarter earnings decreased $3.8 billion from a year ago quarter, though our Upstream earnings were partially offset by stronger Downstream results, whereas decreased Chemical earnings were mostly offset by lower corporate and financing costs. In the sequential comparison shown on slide eight, earnings decreased $1.5 billion due to lower earnings across all business segments. On average, corporate and financing expenses are anticipated to be $500 million to $700 million per quarter over the next year to two years.", "Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results starting on slide nine. Fourth quarter Upstream earnings were $857 million, down $4.6 billion from a year ago quarter. Sharply lower commodity prices reduced earnings by more than $3.7 billion. Crude realizations declined more than $30 per barrel and gas was down $2.76 per thousand cubic feet. Favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings by $100 million.", "Volume additions from new developments were partly offset by regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands. All other items decreased earnings by $960 million, reflecting the absence of prior year impacts including US deferred income tax effects and the recognition of a favorable arbitration ruling for expropriated assets in Venezuela. These were partially offset by lower operating costs.", "Moving to slide 10. Oil equivalent production increased 194,000 barrels per day or 4.8% compared to a year ago quarter. Liquids production was up almost 300,000 barrels per day or nearly 14%, where ramp-up of new development projects, work programs and entitlement effects were partly offset by field decline. Natural gas production decreased about 630 million cubic feet per day due to regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and field decline, partially offset by entitlement effects and development project volumes.", "Turning now to the sequential comparison starting on slide 11. Upstream earnings decreased about $500 million from the third quarter. Lower realizations reduced earnings $840 million where crude prices were about $8 per barrel lower than the third quarter, and natural gas prices were down $0.40 per thousand cubic feet. Volume and mix effects increased earnings $250 million, reflecting new project and work program growth along with higher seasonal demand. All other items added $90 million driven by tax impacts. Upstream unit profitability for the fourth quarter was $2.26 per barrel excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes.", "Moving to slide 12. Sequentially, volumes increased 330,000 oil equivalent barrels per day or 8.4%. Liquid production was up 150,000 barrels per day, reflecting new project growth, work programs and entitlement effects. Natural gas production was 1.1 billion cubic feet per day higher in the third quarter, driven by stronger seasonal demand in Europe, entitlement effects, and new project start-ups.", "Moving now to the Downstream financial and operating results starting on slide 13. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $1.4 billion, up $854 million compared to the year ago quarter. Stronger margins and favorable volumes mix improved earnings by $610 million and $70 million respectively. All other items increased earnings $170 million, primarily driven by reduced maintenance activities and favorable foreign exchange and tax effects partly offset by unfavorable inventory impacts.", "Turning to slide 14. Sequentially, Downstream earnings decreased $682 million as lower margins reduced earnings by $860 million. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $60 million, reflecting lower US maintenance. Other items improved earnings by $120 million, primarily due to higher gains from asset sales partially offset by unfavorable inventory effects.", "Moving now to the Chemical financial and operating results starting on slide 15. Fourth quarter Chemical earnings were $963 million, down $264 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Weaker margins decreased earnings by $210 million, while favorable volumes and mix effects added $170 million due to lower maintenance. All other items decreased earnings by $230 million, largely due to unfavorable foreign exchange, inventory and tax effects.", "Moving to slide 16. Chemical earnings were down $264 million sequentially. Weaker margins reduced earnings by $190 million while favorable volumes mix added $80 million. Other items decreased earnings $160 million, primarily reflecting increased maintenance activities.", "Turning now to the full year financial results starting on slide 17. Now as I mentioned, earnings were $16.2 billion or $3.85 per share. Corporation distributed over $15 billion to shareholders through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. And of that total, $3 billion was used to purchase shares.", "CapEx totaled about $31 billion for the year, a reduction of almost $7.5 billion or 19% versus 2014 and approximately $3 billion below our plans for 2015. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $32.7 billion.", "Turning to slide 18, cash decreased from $4.7 billion to $3.7 billion during the year. Earnings adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items, and our ongoing asset management program resulted in $32.7 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included net investments of $26.2 billion and shareholder distributions of $15 billion. Debt and other financing items provided $7.6 billion in the year.", "Moving to slide 19, graphic illustrates the corporation's sources and uses of cash during the year and highlights our ability to meet our financial objectives. Cash flow from operations and asset sales of $32.7 billion funded shareholder distributions and most of our net investments in the business supplemented by an increase in debt financing. The investments we select have attractive financial returns and justify the moderate use of our strong balance sheet capacity. The scale and integrated nature of our cash flows along with our financial strength provide us the flexibility and confidence to invest through the commodity price cycle to meet long-term energy demand.", "Corporation has continued to pay a reliable and growing dividend, directly sharing the corporation's success with our shareholders. Total dividends per share, $2.88, are up 6.7% versus 2014. As you know, we prudently tapered the share buyback program during 2015, consistent with changes in the business environment and the corporation's cash requirements. In the first quarter of 2016, Exxon Mobil will limit share purchases to amounts needed to offset dilution related to our benefit plans and programs and we do not plan on making additional purchases to reduce shares outstanding.", "During 2015, Exxon Mobil generated $6.5 billion of free cash flow, reflecting our cost and capital discipline and the resilience of our integrated business model. Looking forward, we anticipate capital and exploration expenditures to be $23.2 billion in 2016, a decrease of almost $8 billion or 25% from 2015.", "So to summarize this slide, the corporation finished the year with positive free cash flow. We have significantly lowered our capital spending plans and are aggressively pursuing operating efficiencies and cost savings as we continue to ramp up production from our major projects, all of which will support cash flow moving forward. We will provide further details on investment plans at our upcoming analyst meeting.", "Moving now to slide 20 and a review of our full year segmented results, 2015 earnings decreased $16.4 billion as weaker Upstream results were partially offset by stronger Downstream performance and lower corporate costs.", "Turning now to the full year comparison of Upstream results starting on slide 21. Upstream earnings of $7.1 billion were $20.4 billion lower than 2014. Realizations reduced earnings by $18.8 billion as crude oil prices declined more than $45 per barrel and natural gas dropped about $2.50 per thousand cubic feet. Favorable volume mix effects increased earnings $810 million where contributions from major project startups over the last couple of years as well as our work program activities were partially offset by the impact of regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and field decline. All other items decreased earnings by $2.4 billion. Lower gains on asset sales and absence of prior year deferred income tax effects were partly offset by lower operating expenses.", "Upstream unit profitability for the year was $4.89 per barrel excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes. This reflects significantly lower commodity prices partially offset by asset high-grading, including the startup of new development projects.", "Moving to slide 22. As indicated, volumes ended the year at 4.1 million oil equivalent barrels per day, up 3.2% compared to last year. Liquids production was up 234,000 barrels per day or 11%, benefiting from major projects in several countries, work programs and entitlement impacts, which were partly offset by field decline. Natural gas production however was down 630 million cubic feet per day as regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and field decline were partly offset by additional major project volumes in Papua New Guinea and the US along with higher entitlements.", "Full year comparison for Downstream results is shown on slide 23. Earnings were $6.6 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion from 2014. Stronger refining and marketing margins increased earnings by $4.1 billion. Volume and mix effects mainly driven by increased maintenance reduced earnings by $200 million. All other items decreased earnings by $420 million, while reflecting higher maintenance activities and unfavorable inventory impacts, partly offset by favorable foreign exchange effects.", "On slide 24, we show the full year comparison for Chemical results. 2015 earnings were $4.4 billion, up $103 million from 2014. Stronger margins increased earnings $590 million, while favorable volumes mix added $220 million due to lower maintenance. Other items reduced earnings $710 million, reflecting unfavorable foreign exchange, tax and inventory effects, partly offset by asset management gains.", "Moving next to an update on our Upstream project activities. We continue to deliver on our investment plans, which are adding higher value production capacity to meet long-term demand growth. Fixed major project startups in 2015 added nearly 300,000 oil equivalent barrels per day of working interest capacity. We also progressed development of our high quality acreage in the Permian and Bakken at a measured pace, where drilling programs added 85,000 oil equivalent barrels per day of gross production in 2015.", "In the fourth quarter, the Banyu Urip central processing facility successfully started up. Current gross production is 150,000 barrels per day and continues to ramp up towards full capacity as we optimize both well and facility performance. Looking forward, construction activities continue to progress on 10 major projects that will come online over the next two years. We expect to start up six of those in 2016, which will add more than 250,000 barrels per day of working interest production capacity.", "Moving now to slide 26. We continued to execute a paced and focused exploration program to deliver accretive value to Exxon Mobil's asset portfolio, while capturing cost efficiencies in today's softer market. In offshore Guyana, the largest 3D seismic survey in the company's history is nearly complete and we will begin appraising the Liza discovery during the first quarter. We also acquired a 35% interest in operatorship of the Canje block, which is adjacent to the Stabroek Block, adding over 520,000 net acres.", "In the Romanian Black Sea, Exxon Mobil has completed exploration activities in the Neptun block after successfully drilling seven consecutive wells since July 2014. Based on the results of the program, including a successful well test of the Domino prospect, we are advancing detailed development planning and economic viability studies.", "And in Argentina, we are beginning a production pilot program on the La Invernada and Bajo del Choique blocks in the Neuqu\u00e9n province. Program consists of five wells along with construction of production facilities and a gas pipeline.", "Over the past few months, we have also added high potential acreage to our diverse portfolio. Exxon Mobil acquired a 35% interest in Block 14 offshore Uruguay, capturing almost 580,000 net acres.", "In Canada, we were awarded interests in three blocks offshore Newfoundland and Labrador, adding over 650,000 net acres. These blocks are in a proven oil-prone hydrocarbon basin with recent industry discoveries. And this new opportunity will build on our 18 years of success in Eastern Canada with Hibernia, Terra Nova and the ongoing development at Hebron. And in Western Canada, we acquired additional working interest in our currently producing Duvernay acreage, adding 10,000 net acres.", "So I'd now like to conclude today's comments with a summary of our 2015 performance which demonstrates the resilience of our integrated business. Exxon Mobil earned $16.2 billion, underpinned by the benefits of our integrated business model which captures value through the cycle, as demonstrated by our strong Downstream and Chemical results.", "Corporation achieved its full year plan to produce 4.1 million oil equivalent barrels per day. Volume contributions from a portfolio of new developments underscore our project execution excellence and reputation as a reliable operator.", "Our results also reflect a relentless focus to reduce costs. In 2015, we achieved about $11.5 billion in capital and cash operating cost reductions. Solid operating performance combined with continued investment and cost discipline generated cash flow from operations and asset sales of $32.7 billion and positive free cash flow of $6.5 billion.", "Our commitment to shareholders remain strong as demonstrated by our reliable and growing dividend. So regardless of industry conditions, we remain focused on what we can control and are driven to create shareholder value through the cycle. And we will discuss our forward plans in more detail at our upcoming analyst meeting which will take place at the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, March 2, with the live webcast beginning at 9 a.m. Eastern Time.", "That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Woodbury. And we'll go first to Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. Good morning, Jeff. Good morning everybody.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Good morning, Doug.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Jeff, the CapEx cut is pretty material. I wonder if you could help us reconcile Exxon's view of spending through the cycle with the extent of the cut and maybe give us some idea as to maybe just to clarify two things. Where, is really a function of the slowdown in E&P spending? I mean it was already underway, and does it still include the minority affiliate contribution? And I've got a follow-up please.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Yeah, yeah. Doug, first let me start with your second question first. The CapEx guidance that we've provided for 2016 of $23.2 billion is all in. It includes consolidated and equity companies and it compares directly with the $31.1 billion that we spent in 2015.", "To answer your first question, I'd first like to say that as I said in my prepared comments, we were down in the year in 2015 both from 2014 performance as well as our planned guidance in 2015. And that was primarily a continued focus on capital efficiencies, market savings and a soft business climate. There was reduced activity and then importantly timely project delivery. If you think about 2016, it's more of the same. It reflects prudent cash management and our continued investment through the cycle in attractive high-quality opportunities that we believe will generate long-term shareholder value.", "The short of it is that we're going to continue to live within our means. We're going maintain financial flexibility. And we've got, as you've heard us talk in the past, we've got very diverse high-quality inventory investment opportunities that will continue to progress.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks Jeff. So yeah, I assume that was one question with a couple of parts to it. So my follow-up is, I realize you've been fairly tight-lipped on Guyana to date. Obviously this is a big acreage that you've had. And there's my understanding is Fugro has already started the subsea survey, which suggests that there's and early production system scheme underway. Can you just give us a general update as to where things stand in Guyana, whether there is indeed an early production system target on how you see the overall scale of the opportunity to the extent you can chat about that at this point? Thanks.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Yeah thanks, Doug. I clearly understand the industry interest in the discovery. As we said at the time of discovery, we're very encouraged with the initial results, recognizing that we only have one well in a very, very large block, over 6.5 million acres. We have since the discovery moved quickly to get a drill ship contracted and onsite to appraise the discovery and we expect that to spud very shortly. As I said, the seismic acquisition is nearing completion. The results from both the well as well as the seismic are being actively assessed to assess the full block potential as well as the commercial viability of the Liza discovery.", "Obviously the objective of the first well is an appraisal well in Liza and it's intended to give us important information to size the resource as well as get a test on it to assess the key variables associated with the commercial viability. So I would tell you that there are early studies underway on potential development options for the field, but I don't have anything more to share on that.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks a lot, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Sam Margolin with Cowen & Company.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Good morning.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Good morning, Sam.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "In the press release you called out some of the project startups and what seemed like a net overall favorable mix effect on income. I think that maybe Western Canada is included in the startups but not maybe a contributor to mix income enhancements. Can you talk about Western Canada, kind of the heavy levels of pressure we're seeing on heavy oil out there? And maybe frame an outlook for us.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Yeah, sure. I mean no doubt profitability is compressed in this price environment. As I had said before, we remain very focused on the fundamentals. And I'd tell you that the team there in Canada have done just an exceptional job in driving the cost structure down and enhancing reliability. We are not by any means where we want to be. In fact I would tell you that we're never satisfied with the status quo. We will continue to work that, recognizing that we feel very good about the resource potential, not only in Kearl, but in Western Canada in our portfolio. We think that over the long term, the asset's going be a high value. The focus is around maintaining cash profit and maximizing long-term value in the asset.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you. And it's sort of on the other end of the same spectrum I guess is LNG, which is considered by many investors to be cost prohibitive but actually has a pretty low overhead once it's operating. Can you help us understand how that contributed this quarter and through the year, specifically with PNG and some of the positive income contributions there.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Sure. I mean, Sam, it's a great question. Because LNG clearly is a key component of our portfolio and it is an important part of our margin generation. Remember, we're constructive on long-term demand. For gas, as you just saw the recent update on our energy outlook, we got gas growing about 1.6% per year. LNG is anticipated to triple between now and 2040. So we're very well poised to participate in that demand growth over the long term.", "I will tell you that for, let's use PNG as a really good example. The initial design basis of PNG was about 6.9 million tons per annum. As we said in the third quarter, the organization did a exceptional job in doing what we do very well, and that is getting more out of the asset. And we were able to get it up to in excess of 7.4 million tons per annum, which has been just a phenomenal result. And we're still going. So it's a good example of how we really continue to manage the existing assets to reduce the cost structure and improve operational reliability to maximize long-term asset value.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Very helpful. Thank you so much.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "You bet, Sam.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.", "Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, Jeff, good morning.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Good morning, Phil.", "Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "First question is just kind of a bigger picture macro question. Obviously pricing has been tough across all end markets, oil, natural gas, LNG. And I'm just curious if you see a fundamental supply/demand improvement happening in any one particular market versus another over the next year or two. So for example, do you see oil recovering faster than natural gas or anything else along those lines?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Yeah, so I guess I'd say that we're price takers. And we manage the business to create margin through self help. We have built this business to ensure that it's durable in a low price environment. And then any upside from that is additional return on the investment. So the organization is very focused on really managing the fundamentals. As I indicated, we're for both gas and oil. We're constructive on long-term demand growth and is the fundamental basis for the investment decisions that we've put in place. And if you look near-term, demand's been growing about 1 million barrels per day per year. And although supply has been growing at a higher rate, we certainly have, I mean the first half of this year, we're about 1.5 million barrels a day in excess of demand. We expect that to converge in the second half as seasonal demand increases.", "We got to come in balance, like we have seen historically. We do have a bit of a buildup in crude storage that will have to be worked off before you see real growth in prices. But ultimately, we're going to manage wherever we are in the price cycle to create margin by focusing on the fundamentals. Same story around LNG. As I said previously, that we're very constructive on where LNG demand is going to go over from now to 2040.", "Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Understood. The second question is just on the capital spending guidance. Thanks for giving us the preview ahead of the Analyst Day. I guess what I was wondering was, year over year how much of that you might attribute to project roll-off or deflationary benefits versus a reduction in activity. And just in general, you came in under the 2015 budget as you said. How much flexibility is there do you think relative to the guidance number versus that being kind of the lowest you could go?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Yeah, Phil, I don't have specific numbers to quote with you. I mean, and as I said we'll talk more about our investment plans and our thoughts on volumes next month in the analyst meeting. But a couple things to share with you. Clearly, our peak was back in 2013 at about $42.5 billion. The drop from 2013 to 2014 was primarily a result of a drop-off on this very significant major project load that we decided to take on. Obviously in every year, we are working on capital efficiency opportunities to build into our spend pattern.", "As we go forward, I would tell you right now most of the drop is associated with the prudent cash management that we've got. It's not indicative of the quality of the portfolio. As I've said previously, our portfolio is very deep and diverse across the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical business. Some of the activity that we've slowed down really provides us an opportunity to rethink near-term investments and really fully capture the market benefits going forward. But short of that, I really don't have any more specifics to share as to breaking the CapEx spend down further. We'll continue to live within our means as we've shown historically, and if we need be, we'll have to tighten up if we have to further.", "Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "So you see some additional flexibility even relative to this guidance?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "We've got flexibility both ways.", "Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hey, good day. Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Good morning, Evan.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Exxon's unique, relatively unique in its ability and dedication to counter-cyclically spend. Can you discuss the decision to cut the buyback in that context, and is that reduction any reflection on relative attractiveness of the portfolio, value of the stock or a weaker macro outlook?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "No, I mean we've got a very, as I said a very deep and diverse portfolio. Much of that investment could be moved forward in today's environment, but as I indicated, we have a real opportunity to go ahead and rethink some of those expenditure patterns and capture more value from those investments. So the decision to cut the buyback doesn't at all reflect the quality of the inventory. Quite the contrary. I mean the inventory is very robust.", "The decision on the buyback, as we've said before, our capital allocation approach is really focused on the dual priority of funding attractive investments and continuing to provide a reliable and growing dividend, and the share buybacks have always been the flexible part of our capital allocation program. As we continue to progress in a very challenging business climate, you saw us prudently taper back the buyback program. We will continue to evaluate the buyback program on a quarterly basis depending on changes in the business as well as the investment climate, and advise on a quarterly basis when we think it's, when it's appropriate.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Maybe if I can shift gears into the US. You're currently running I think seven rigs in the Bakken and eight rigs in the Permian. I mean maybe particularly in the Bakken, what's the driver of continued activity at current prices? I mean are those economic wells, or are you preserving efficiencies for an ultimate reacceleration? And maybe the same question for the Permian, yet that might be kind of HBP driven. Any color would be helpful.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Yeah, Evan, it's a good question because we have a very extensive well inventory in our unconventional business, particularly in the liquids plays, the Permian, Bakken and the Woodford Ardmore. Once again, it's a conscious decision to be measured in our investment program. When we saw the big ramp-up in rigs back in 2014, 2015, we were very measured in how we ramped up because we wanted to ensure that we fully developed the learning curve and captured those real cost benefits that translate into higher value as we fully developed these fields.", "So the investments that we're making right now are economic. They're attractive in this business climate. We are maintaining a certain baseload of activity where we can continue to leverage some of the best service providers that we've got. We're one of the few that can continue to invest in a down cycle. We've high-graded all the services that we get in our unconventional business. In fact, I'd extend that globally. And we are continuing on those learning curves, and I think it just better positions us to maximize the value from these assets.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Appreciate it. Thanks.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "You bet.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI.", "Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Good morning, Doug.", "Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI", "So on slides 25 and 26 you talked about the project portfolio and the growth trajectory longer term. Simultaneously though, when you consider that the growth is coming at the expense of returns during the past cycle, not just for Exxon, but for the other supermajors too, it makes me wonder whether there should be more emphasis towards value creation, especially when considering that the valuation for some of the big oil companies is pretty much at its lowest level of the past two decades and in some cases three decades. My question is whether or not the issues of structure and returns and growth are being revisited internally, maybe more so than in the past. Or is that what is implied in the new spending outlook that you talked about today? And then also whether or not returns on capital, which I didn't see mentioned in the presentation, is still as relevant as it used to be. So two questions.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Yes. Doug, on the first one, I mean your point about value creation in our investment program, we couldn't agree with you more. And I would tell you that it is never \u2013 our view has never changed on the importance of making the right value choices. We saw back in the, I'd say in the early 2000s to the mid 2010 timeframe, we saw a number of major Upstream projects that got to the point of maturity that we could make a investment decision and capture unique value by progressing such a large load of major Upstream investments. There were cost synergies that we were going to capture that ultimately was going improve the long-term return of those assets. So we knew that by taking on such a large load, it was going to impact our return on capital employed because we would build up a very large load of non-productive capital employed. But we also knew that when those projects came onstream, that they were going be accretive to our overall average financial performance.", "So unfortunately as these projects are coming on, the price environment has changed for us. But nonetheless we still feel very good about the long-term financial performance of these assets. Because remember, when we make the final investment decision, we're testing those investments across a wide range of economic parameters, including price. And as I said earlier, our fundamental focus has been making sure that our business is viable and durable in a low price environment. So ultimately we believe that these 30 plus major Upstream projects that had an impact, rightfully so, had an impact on our return on capital employed are going be accretive to our financial performance over the long term and we believe they were the right decision. Now to your second question on return on capital employed, it is still very much relevant to us.", "Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI", "Okay.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "We believe it is a fundamental measure that differentiates us, and that's why we continue to talk about it. We have never lost sight of the importance of that metric relative to the investment decisions that we're making.", "Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI", "Okay. Great. Maybe there will be a returns and valuation and catch-up in a more normalized environment in the future then.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "That's correct.", "Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Thank you, Doug.", "Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI", "Yeah.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.", "Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Yeah, good morning. Congrats on obviously $11.5 billion of capital and OpEx savings. OpEx, you haven't really spoken about as much this morning. Just maybe run through some of the actions you took to reduce OpEx over the course of last year and then the potential to cut OpEx further.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Yeah, thanks for that, Ed, because it is a very important story of our 2015 performance. First, let me just make sure everybody understands the number that we've been talking about. The numbers are fully consistent with our external reporting so that you all have good line of sight. Of the $11.5 billion I mentioned, about $8.5 billion of that is operating expenses, and it includes a number of things positive and negative. For instance, it includes the structural efficiencies that we were able to capture. It includes the market savings that we've been able to capture.", "Remember, I've talked in the past about having a unique organization or global procurement organization that is really focused on achieving the lowest life cycle cost. The number includes benefits in energy costs, includes benefits from our asset management program as well as ForEx. There are increases in that number. Obviously we've been talking about all these new projects coming onstream. With them comes an increase in operating costs. And we'll continue to manage those assets like we do with our mature inventory. There was also a higher Downstream load on unplanned maintenance that added cost during the year.", "So simply put, the $8.5 billion is a year on year comparison. The rest, $3 billion, is in CapEx and includes a lot of the same actions I just talked about as well as decisions to slow down some activity to capture opportunities in this business climate. I will note that that $3 billion only reflects the reduction from our planned guidance. As I said in the prepared comments, our year on year reduction in CapEx was $7.5 billion. So we didn't really include the $4.5 billion in the $11.5 billion that I talked about in the prepared comments. So in total, year on year our total reduction is really $16 billion if you include the $4.5 billion.", "Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Yeah, and then in terms of the ability to drive further OpEx, I mean another 10%, another 15%, I mean how low do you think you can get that OpEx saving?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "It's a great question, Ed. It really is, because it really talks to the strength of the organization. In this low price environment, it presents opportunities too. And the organization is never satisfied with the status quo. The organization is very focused on leading that cost curve. And while we may have some internal stewardship objectives, rest assured that we continue to look for new unique ways to capture structural improvements which are most important, because remember, those are the ones that will be permanent going forward. So there's a lot more to work on. But I don't have any specific numbers at this point.", "Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. I look forward to the Analyst Day. Thank you.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Okay.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great, thanks. Good morning, Jeff. Maybe if I could follow-up on the comment that you've made a couple of times now. You've talked about how you guys are rethinking near term investments and the way you deploy capital. I mean how much does this refer to an evolution of your views on relative attractiveness amongst various components of the portfolio in terms of, does this represent at all a shift in attractiveness of onshore versus deepwater versus oil sands or LNG, et cetera? Or how much is just referring to rethinking the cost structure in the near term environment in an effort to continue to push down prices?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "It's really both. It's every investment dollar is competing. So it's all about how do we get the most value out of those investment dollars that are being deployed throughout the business. The organization, as I indicated, really views the down cycle as a real opportunity to go back and retest development concepts, retest the cost structures, retest the commercial terms. And whether it's short cycle or long cycle, we're going to maintain that competitive focus and make the right value choices coupled with our prudent cash management.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great, thanks. And then maybe just as a follow-up on that, I mean during the most recent downturn in 2008, 2009, you took advantage of the environment by pushing through more counter-cyclical investment in places like the Canadian oil sands. And I think we all realize that this downturn is different, but do you see similar opportunities to leverage your strength in this environment, either on the cost and project development side or maybe even on the research acquisition side? Or is your outlook different enough at this point that you feel that more prudence is necessary in the short to medium term?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Well I mean clearly, given the uncertainty in prices, we're going to maintain prudency. But at the same time, as I've said a couple times, Ryan, we really do see that this is an opportunity to capture further value in the bottom of the cycle, and across all the areas I've already mentioned. But there are plenty of opportunities that the organization's focused on to really make that value proposition. And I'd also add that because of our ability to invest through this cycle, our service providers understand that if they can provide lower-cost, higher-value solutions to us, then we'll continue to invest if it makes good business sense. So having not only the organization focused on it, but also our service providers focused on it has provided some unique opportunities for us.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great.

Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Good morning, Paul.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Jeff, I'm looking forward to seeing you all at the analyst meeting. I know that Mr. Tillerson's been in New York a couple of times \u2013 I should say in New York and in Miami making some statements. I haven't personally spoken to him since last March. The general message that you had then was certainly that we would be lower for longer. I assume he's still making that argument. I think that he was saying that you guys would be typically keen to make acquisitions at the bottom of the cycle, but the bid/ask spreads were too wide. He was saying less interest in buying a balance sheet that was bad. He would prefer to buy a balance sheet that was good, and I think you've said that consolidation in the Permian would be an area of interest. Is that the latest message that we've got, for example, at the Miami conference? I'm sorry, I wasn't present. I was wondering if the message has changed. Thanks.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Yeah, well I mean from a supply/demand perspective, I shared some of our thoughts around expectations. Clearly the oversupply currently and the overhang from storage is going to have a dampening effect on prices in the near term. But Paul, as we've talked in the past, we continue to be focused on the fundamentals and through our self-help creating margin, and that's what's most important for this business. We invest to ensure that the business is durable at low prices. We continue to manage the business based on our focus on the fundamentals to create margin. From a acquisition perspective, clearly I'm sure there's a tremendous amount of interest. We remain very patient. We keep alert to the value propositions. But it's as I've said before, anything that we see out there has got be competitive with our current investment inventory.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Sure. I mean the bid/ask spread element, is that, must \u2013 I mean by just looking at the share price charts, that has to be narrowing now between what you guys would see as value and what sellers would.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Yeah. Well I mean clearly, bid/asks could be a function of a number of factors including the business climate, unique capabilities and assessments of individual investors. And certainly, the longer the commodity prices are in this area code, the more pressure it will put on the bid/ask. But I think also, Paul, as you're probably well aware, I mean the absence of any major deals absent a few couple one-offs really talks that there's still a gap to valuations. We'll be thoughtful. We'll make sure that anything that looks of interest is going to be value adding.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Indeed. And then a bit of a technical question. Does Mr. Tillerson retire on his 65th birthday, or at the beginning of 2017 typically? I mean, what would be the model? I guess what I'm driving at is, is this going to be his last analyst meeting?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Yeah, well I mean I'm not going to provide any specifics. That's really at the function of the board's decision.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Right. Okay. Thank you.", "Jeffrey J.

Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "I guess I'd like to follow-up a little more on your Lower 48. You talked earlier about the rig count and trying to maintain spending within a reasonable level of returns, but balancing that against the maintaining the right amount of service sector capability and all. But as you look at Lower 48 volume growth, which was certainly reasonable in the past year, does it grow in 2016 at these levels? And I know you wouldn't necessarily start with the idea of growth, but does it grow at these levels?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Yeah. Well I don't have any specifics to share with you right now. But I would tell you, think about this, is that the choices that we are making are all based on value propositions. The outcome of those will be volumes. And as I indicated earlier, Roger, we've got a very deep portfolio of investment opportunities in the Lower 48, particularly in the unconventional business. And we'll maintain an appropriate balance of short-cycle investments. And when we feel like that the business climate supports it, we'll probably increase the amount of activity. I think what's important to note is that we are very well poised to flex the program up or down depending on the business climate.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Appreciate that. The other question I had was on the share repo program, understand taking it off the table for now. If you were to get a surprise influx of cash flow, just say higher commodity prices, is the decision in the near term that it would likely go towards shareholder returns or that CapEx would go up? I know Exxon is not a quick trigger place like some other businesses, but you do have opportunities as you've said in the Lower 48. What's sort of the internal thinking on that front?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Well, I mean if it was an influx of cash flow, I would tell you that it's going to be a function of the board's decision on a quarterly basis. I mean, if we see supply and demand continuing to balance out, that may be a signal for us to modify our investment plans going forward. But as I've indicated previously, Roger, the board makes the decision on a quarterly basis on what level of buybacks we want to maintain, and consider a whole range of factors including the business climate in making that decision.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "All right. So Powerball lottery by itself doesn't do it. You have to have some other fundamental things helping you out.", "Jeffrey J.

Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Good morning, Neil.", "Neil Singhvi Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "So Jeff, you've had a great year here of production. This is something where I'm sure we'll get more clarity in March. But can you just talk about at $23 billion, how you think about the level of production relative to the 4.2 million barrels a day that you outlined last year for 2016, and then which, broadly speaking, which regions where you would see potential changes?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Yeah well, Neil, let me first just take an opportunity to acknowledge a very strong operational year in 2015. Achieving the 4.1 million oil equivalent barrels per day which I'll just want to emphasize for the group. It's really an outcome of our value choices that we've made. The organization has really delivered on the timely startup of our major projects, which are a very key and significant contribution to our volumes this year.", "I'll say looking forward, as I alluded to in the prepared comments, we have 10 more large-scale long-life projects starting up over the next couple of years. The first, the next tranche of that will be six of the 10 starting up in 2016. We maintained a very strong focus on the high-value work program as well as operational reliability. Looking forward, we will be sharing more on our near term investment plans and some thoughts on our volumes in the upcoming analyst meeting. But I really don't have any more specifics to share with you at this point.", "Neil Singhvi Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "I appreciate that, Jeff. And then obviously one of Exxon's key advantages here is your balance sheet. In light of some of the comments from the ratings agencies, can you just talk about your commitment to your AAA rating here? And then any perspective that you can provide around how that could change as ratings agencies think about their market outlook.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Yeah it's a good question, Neil, and clearly it's topical for many in the energy sector. I mean first and foremost, let me just be clear. We get value from the AAA credit rating in our business, whether it be access to financial markets or access to resources. I mean there is a benefit that we get from it, and we see it as being important. But it is really an outcome of our longstanding effective management of the business, including things like our strong balance sheet, the way we have prudently managed our cash, our disciplined investment and our leading financial and operating results, all of which has allowed us the financial flexibility to invest through the cycle as we've been discussing. I'd tell you that the current environment is clearly tough. But we've managed the business to be durable on the low end of commodity prices. We're very well positioned to continue the same level with superior performance in the future and we think that all underpins the strong credit rating that we have.", "Neil Singhvi Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J.

It looked like you have $800 million on the asset sales proceed. What is the asset sales gain in the quarter? And that also do you have, it seems like that you may have some tax adjustment benefit in the quarter, and that you have also mentioned I think some FX impact and also inventory impact. Can you quantify those items in the quarter and if possible, by segment also?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Yes, so Paul, on the proceeds from asset sales which was about $800 million in the fourth quarter, the equivalent earnings impact is about $350 million, primarily in the Downstream. Could you talk a little bit more about the second question, just make sure I?", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yeah, it looked like that the effective tax rate is 13% in the quarter. We understand the mix of the earning, oftentimes the impact, the absolute level of the tax, but it does look like it's low enough that you may have some tax benefit or adjustment, year-end adjustment on that. Just curious if that's the case. And if it is, can you quantify it? What is the tax adjustment benefit and also that which segment is being impact? And also that I think in your prepared remark, you have comment that some impact on the earnings on the FX and also inventory. So just want to see if you can quantify those.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Sure, sure, okay. Let me walk through them for you. On ForEx, the quarter on quarter impact is essentially nil. I mean it's a slight negative to earnings, less than $5 million.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "How about sequentially?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "I'm sorry, say that again.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Sequentially you're talking about right, this one closest to?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "That was quarter on quarter.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Fourth quarter 2015 to fourth quarter 2014. The full year had a negative impact on our earnings of about $125 million. That's ForEx, okay. On tax, so yes, our effective tax rate was 13% in the fourth quarter, and that was down about 19% quarter on quarter. A fair bit of that had to do with one-time tax items. The rest, about 5%, was due to portfolio mix of income across the business segments and the geographies. And that's really spread across our corporate and finance as well as some of the segments.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Jeff, when you say that one-time tax item, 14%, seems like you're talking about 14% because you say 19% overall reduction, 5% is due to the mix of the asset, and so the one-time item is 14%. Is that 14% spread across different segment or it is primarily in Upstream?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "It's in corporate and finance and several of the other segments. I don't have a breakdown for you.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. And how about inventory impact?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Yeah, before I leave tax, I just want to be clear for everybody that assuming our current commodity prices and our existing portfolio mix, we still would anticipate that the effective tax rate is between 35% to 40%. If you look at the full year of tax in 2015, it was just under 34% and that included obviously some one-time tax effects. Okay? On inventory, Paul, quarter on quarter, it had a negative earnings impact of about $375 million.", "Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Okay. You're welcome, Paul.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Anish Kapadia with TPH.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Good morning, Anish.", "Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP", "Hi. Good morning. Just had a question looking at production and declines. If we look at 2015, it seems like underlying production was flat. So we saw new projects that were offset by production declines. I wanted to try and understand in terms of 2016 how much of your CapEx is going into the base business and to mitigate declines. And so what do you see the underlying decline rate to be with the current spend? Thank you.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Anish, we have an underlying decline, as we included in our 10-K, of about 3%. On top of that, we add major project activity. Again, I don't break it out by use, and we'll talk more about investment plans in the analyst meeting next month.", "Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP", "Okay. And just to clarify on that, so given the CapEx cuts that we've seen, you wouldn't expect that decline rate to accelerate on the back of the CapEx cuts?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "No. Remember, it's a base decline rate ex-major project activity.", "Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP", "Okay. The second question was on plans for space for new major projects. Given that cutback in the CapEx, do you have any potential FIDs for this year that you're looking to sanction?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Yeah, on FIDs, we just don't forecast FIDs in advance of the investment decision made by the corporation. When we make that decision, when the investments get to a level of maturity and we make that decision, then we communicate. I'll remind you that we have 10 major projects that will start up in the next two years, as I indicated before, and they will certainly...", "Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP", "Can I just?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "And they will certainly contribute to our base performance.", "Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP", "I just wanted to clarify, I think I might have missed it from earlier. I mean there was a question on the impact of production from the cutback in your rigs. What would you expect your exit to exit US onshore production to be this year?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Well as I indicated, we'll share more about our investment plans as well as our thoughts on volumes in next month's analyst meeting. We've got a very deep, robust inventory of development projects in the Upstream, and we'll talk more about that next month, or I guess, yeah, next month.", "Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP", "Sure. Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Jason Gammel with Jefferies.", "Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.", "Oh yes, hi. Thanks, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Morning, Jason.", "Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.", "I was hoping you might be able to just give us a little bit of the detail on those project startups that you're expecting in 2016 and 2017, just to make sure my list is correct. And if you want to share the contribution that the 2016 startups are making towards that 250 kpd capacity, that would be helpful as well.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Yeah, on the startups in 2016, of course we've got Gorgon, Jansz. We have late in the year Kashagan. We've got Julia in the Gulf of Mexico, Heidelberg in the Gulf of Mexico, Point Thomson in Alaska and Barzan in Qatar. And Jason, we provide the peak level of capacity in our F&O.", "Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.", "Great. So that probably hasn't changed too much since that was published then.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "No, and we'll provide an update to that list next month as well.", "Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.", "Got it. And if I could just ask one more, Jeff, on the Downstream. You've put in place a couple of projects in Europe to potentially take advantage of heavier feedstocks over time, let's see, Antwerp being the primary one. I was hoping you'd talk about what you're seeing just in terms of those heavier feedstocks within Europe and how the profitability's evolving on that.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Yeah, thanks for the question on the Downstream, because the organization has really performed tremendously in the year. Our investments in the Downstream, particularly in Europe, are really focused on the following items, one, to increase feedstock flexibility, The second is to increase logistics flexibility. The third one is to increase higher value product yields. And I'll come back to that. And then the last and important one is fully capturing the integration value of our manufacturing facilities and reducing our cost structure.", "On the higher value product yields, when we talk about Antwerp or Rotterdam, both are achieving the same objective. On Antwerp, we're converting bunker fuel oil into ultra-low sulfur diesel, again constructive on longer-term supply/demand. And in Rotterdam we're converting VGO into premium Group II basestocks and as well ultra-low sulfur diesel.", "Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.", "That's great. Appreciate that, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Great. You're welcome.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Asit Sen with CLSA.", "Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC", "Thanks. Hi, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Hi, Asit.", "Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC", "Two questions. One very quick one on Banyu Urip. Nice ramp-up there. When do you get to peak and any update on the size of recoverable resource? I think that's 450 million barrels and cost I thought you guys mentioned, $3 billion.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Yeah, so the size of the resource, let me just confirm your number. It's about 450 million barrels gross. The ramp-up, we should be up at full rates somewhere in the first half of this year.", "Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC", "Okay and the cost, I think $3 billion?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "You know, Asit, I don't think we've shared the cost publicly.", "Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC", "Okay. Okay. All right. And then moving on to LNG. Thanks for your color on the long-term LNG market. Just wondering if you could share any read into emerging near-term trend, LNG particularly response in China to a lower pricing environment? Given your comment on China deceleration, I thought that was a overall comment. And also on LNG, any update on Golden Pass?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Yeah, I guess two points. On the near-term expectation of LNG, there's a number of projects, some of which are already coming online that are probably going to take us above demand for a period of time, say into 2020 to 2023 when the supply and demand will start coming to converge again. So clearly, I mean it's going have a pressure on those volumes that are trading on the spot market.", "Just to remind everybody, when we make a investment decision on these projects, we lock in our investment decisions on long-term contracts. Golden Pass, we have submitted our formal application with FERC to construct and operate the project. We're working closely with the federal and state agencies for completing the review process in 2016. The final investment decision will be made once we've gone through the government and regulatory approvals.", "Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Allen Good with Morningstar.", "Allen Good - Morningstar Research", "Good morning.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Good morning, Allen.", "Allen Good - Morningstar Research", "I wonder if given all the changes that we've seen in the oil markets over the last call it 18 months, has Exxon revised the range of prices that it uses to evaluate investment decisions?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Well I'd say, Allen, that we continue to see that the range is applicable, given our constructive review on supply and demand. We won't speculate on specific prices or differentials. We certainly expect the weakness until supply and demand comes back into balance and the storage overhang is worked off. As I've said a few times, Allen, regardless of what the price is doing, we're going to keep on focused on those things that we control, which really translates into self-help margin.", "Allen Good - Morningstar Research", "Thanks, that helps. And then deepwater offshore, a very big part of Exxon's portfolio, getting bigger from what you've shared today. Can you give any indication as to what Exxon's seeing with respect to either cost savings via equipment or services or maybe even cost savings on the redesign of certain projects that will ultimately lower the breakevens and make them more competitive within your portfolio?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Yeah, really good question. There's a lot of different variables in this, one in terms of the quality of the resources and the certainty on overall potential from those resources. Another one being how do we get the structural capital efficiency built in so that the economics are more robust. I'll highlight a couple things. One, in 2015, you'll recall in West Africa we brought on two very capital-efficient subsea tiebacks to the existing infrastructure, one being the Kizomba Satellites Phase 2, another one being Erha North Phase 2, that allows us to leverage existing knowledge and develop the deepwater resource in a much more cost-effective way. Clearly, there's a lot of opportunity to continue to standardize the subsea kit, but the organization is looking at all the levers to improve the economics of deepwater. In the Gulf of Mexico, I should note that Hadrian South was another example of an efficient, capital-efficient subsea tieback into existing infrastructure.", "Allen Good - Morningstar Research", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.", "Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Good morning, Brad.", "Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Most of my questions have been answered, so I'll keep it short. I was just curious back on CapEx, I would assume that Downstream is relatively flat sequentially and that the vast majority of the cut is coming from the Upstream side.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Yeah, we'll provide more insight on that, Brad. But as you saw in 2015, our Downstream and Chemical spending plan increased with a number of very large projects that we saw significant value chain benefit, with the polyethylene trains in Baytown to the European investments that we've already talked about. And of course, those projects are continuing as you go into 2016 and start up into 2017. So the trend is going to continue going forward.", "Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.", "John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC", "Yeah hi, Jeff. A couple quick ones from me since so many things have been asked. For the Liza offset well, will we be talking about this in the second quarter conference or in the first quarter conference call? Or will it TD by then?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "So, John, I don't really have the specifics. When we believe there's something that would be important to share externally, we'll go ahead and share it. I just don't know whether the first quarter will be the appropriate time or not at this point.", "John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC", "Okay. That's fine. Many of your peers, Jeff, are restructuring. They're rightsizing or downsizing. Exxon hasn't had any news like that. So are there any plans in the work or do you feel that you have an adequately sized workforce given your business model?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Yeah, it's a good question, John, and I appreciate you asking it. Let me first say for the group's benefit that one of our greatest strengths are our people. And I think those of us that went through the layoffs in the 1980s really learned some of the hard lessons about how those layoffs significantly impaired organizational effectiveness. I mean since then, we have been very diligent at managing employee head count given the cyclical nature of the business and the need by the organization to be ever more productive and at the same time grow collective competency to meet the challenges in front of us. In doing so, I'd also say that we've been unrelenting on our focus of capturing efficiencies to make sure that we rightsize the organization, again given the likelihood of business volatility.", "I'd also highlight, John, that another benefit of our integrated business model is that we're able to be agile in redeploying personnel to segments of our business that are experiencing market strength or growth, such as our Downstream and Chemical businesses right now. All that said, our employee head count has been coming down consistently since the Exxon and Mobil merger. We're down about 35% through 2015. Over that time period, if you look at just the last five years, we're down about 20%. And I can rest assured that the organization's going to continue to be focused on productivity enhancements and making sure that we're getting all the efficiencies out of the business.", "John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC", "Sure. But you haven't had anything that's knee jerk or reactionary as some of your peers of late? It's just been part of your normal plan, correct?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "That's correct.", "John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC", "All right, thanks.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Thank you, John.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.", "Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Just one from me. You talk about entering acreage in some new geographies, particularly some frontier type of geographies. Since the oil down cycle began, have you noticed fiscal terms becoming more accommodating in any areas? And if you can provide any examples that would be great.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Good morning, Pavel. I would tell you that certainly given the downturn, there are more opportunities for us to consider. There is nothing that I can share with you specifically, but it does speak to the strength of Exxon Mobil given that we've got the capability to invest through the down cycle. We bring a tremendous amount of operational, commercial and project expertise. So it allows us to be very selective as to what choices we want to pursue with a very strong focus on placing our attention on those areas that are close to existing producing infrastructure, those areas that have very high quality large resource potential.", "Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Appreciate it.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Thank you, Pavel.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Guy Baber with Simmons.", "Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International", "Good morning, Jeff, and thanks for answering all the questions.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Good morning, Guy.", "Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International", "I know this is a tough question to answer, but I'm interested in how you think about this strategically. But given the scale of the CapEx reductions we're seeing, how do you think about the sustainability of these lower organic spending levels with respect to being sufficient to drive a modest level of production growth for the portfolio, yet also replenish the resource base? Are you spending now below what you believe is sustainable? And how do you think about the balance between spending at a sustainable level versus perhaps rationing lower to limit your out spend for a period of time?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Yeah, I would tell you, Guy, to really think about the decisions that we're making are really value driven. The output is really the volumes, but it's really making the choices that are aligned with creating value in the portfolio, whether it be in the Upstream or the Downstream or Chemical business, recognizing that we've got this integration, this very strong integration across our portfolio that we can create value through the whole value chain. So the choices are really focused on making sure that we're creating incremental value. The volumes will be an output of that.", "Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International", "Got it. That's helpful, Jeff. And then last one for me, and I apologize if I missed this earlier, but given your global perspective, your participation in various Downstream markets across the globe, can you give us the view on leading-edge global oil demand growth for 2016? Any color would be great as it's obviously a critical piece of the global supply/demand balance.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Yeah. Well, I mean you're talking about oil demand?", "Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International", "Yes. Yes. Specifically oil demand.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Yeah. Well I talked a little bit earlier about underlying demand growth has been over 1 million barrels per day, so it's been a little bit higher than what we've seen over the 10-year average. You think about where we are today, we're about 1.5 million barrels a day oversupply in the first half. We do expect that to converge in the second half with seasonal demand growth. So you think about the impact on prices in the near term, it's really going be a function of how that supply/demand converges, and of course working off the storage overhang that's been built up over the last couple years. That's about all I can share at this point.", "Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International", "Got it. Thanks, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'll turn it back over to Mr. Jeff Woodbury for any closing remarks.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary", "Well, thank you. To conclude, again I'd like to thank you for your time and questions. I just want to step back for a moment and take stock of 2015 and say the organization really did a very significant, provided a very significant result when you think about it: positive free cash flow; very effective cost management, lowering our spending that had bottom line impacts, benefits to the business; our excellence in project execution and our delivering long-life, long-plateau volumes; the benefits of the integrated business model across the value chain; the financial strength of the organization, investing through the commodity price cycle; and then of course our dividend growth, continuing to share the success of the company.", "And I think that just points to the strong business fundamentals based on our proven track record. We'll talk more about this in March, but we do appreciate your interest in Exxon Mobil and we certainly look forward to meeting with you next month.", "Operator", "And that does conclude today's conference call.

Today's call is being recorded.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome to ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings call.", "My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. Before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement, shown on slide 2.", "Turning now to slide 3, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our second quarter performance. ExxonMobil earned $3.4 billion in the quarter, bringing year-to-date cumulative earnings to $7.4 billion.", "First and foremost, we remain focused on business fundamentals; that is, operational integrity, costs, reliability, and disciplined investment, with the objective of growing value regardless of the commodity price environment. Cash flow from operations and asset sales exceeded dividends and net investments in the business for the third consecutive quarter.", "We continued to advance key projects across the value chain for strategic growth, some of which I'll highlight later. In the Downstream and Chemical segments, we're investing to meet growing demand for higher-value specialty and differentiated commodity products across the globe.", "Moving to slide 4, we provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. The global economy maintained modest growth in the second quarter. In the U.S. and China, economic expansion accelerated compared to the previous quarter, while Japan and the Eurozone experienced steady growth rates.", "As you know, the commodity price environment weakened in the quarter, as both crude oil and natural gas prices decreased. Nonetheless, the global rig count increased, driven primarily by higher North American activity, compounding uncertainty, and future supply/demand balances.", "Refining margins improved with heavy industry maintenance and a change to summer gasoline specifications, whereas global chemical commodity margins showed signs of softening with new industry capacity coming online, as anticipated.", "Turning now to the financial results, as shown on slide 5, as indicated, ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings were $3.4 billion or $0.78 per share. In the quarter, the corporation distributed $3.3 billion in dividends to our shareholders. CapEx was $3.9 billion, down 24% from the prior-year period, as the corporation remains disciplined in its investment plans while delivering investment-class execution. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $7.1 billion. And at the end of the quarter, cash totaled $4 billion and debt was $41.9 billion, down $1.7 billion from the prior quarter.", "The next slide provides additional detail on sources of uses of cash. Over the quarter, cash balances decreased from $4.9 billion to $4 billion. Earnings adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items, and our ongoing asset management program yielded $7.1 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses of cash included shareholder distributions of $3.3 billion and net investments in the business of $3 billion. Debt reduction and other financing items decreased cash by $1.7 billion. Cash flow from operations and asset sales more than covered dividends and net investments, with an excess nearly $800 million.", "In the second quarter, ExxonMobil did not make any share repurchases to offset dilution related to our benefit plans and programs, and we don't currently plan on making additional purchases to reduce shares outstanding in the third quarter.", "Moving on to slide 7 for a review of our segmented results, ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings increased $1.7 billion from the year-ago quarter, driven by stronger Upstream and Downstream results and lower corporate charges due to one-time favorable tax items.", "In the sequential quarter comparison, shown on slide 8, earnings decreased $660 million due to weaker results from the Upstream and Chemical segments. This was partly offset by lower corporate charges due to one-time favorable tax items and stronger Downstream performance. On average, we expect corporate and financing expenses will continue to be between $400 million to $600 million per quarter in the near term.", "I'll note that our corporate effective tax rate for the quarter was 31%, down from 40% a year ago, reflecting changes in our segment earnings mix and other one-time items.", "Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results, starting on slide 9. Second quarter Upstream earnings were $1.2 billion, an increase of nearly $900 million from the prior-year quarter, due to higher realizations. Crude prices rose about $3.50 per barrel versus a year-ago quarter, and gas realizations increased more than $1.00 per thousand cubic feet. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $140 million, largely because of sales timing and lower entitlements.", "Compared to the second quarter of 2016, we had a net underlift of more than 150,000 barrels per day. All other items increased earnings $140 million, driven by lower operating expenses. Upstream unit profitability for the quarter was $3.41 per barrel excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes.", "Moving to slide 10, oil equivalent production in the quarter was 3.9 million barrels per day, a decrease of nearly 1% compared to the second quarter of 2016. Liquids production was down 61,000 barrels per day, as new project volumes and buildup from work programs were more than offset by field decline and lower entitlements. Natural gas production increased 158 million cubic feet per day, as volumes from new projects and work program more than offset field decline, lower seasonal demand, and regulatory impacts in the Netherlands.", "Turning now to the sequential comparison, starting on slide 11, Upstream earnings were $1.1 billion less than in the first quarter of the year, as lower realizations for both liquids and gas reduced earnings by $390 million. Crude prices decreased more than $3.00 per barrel and natural gas fell $0.29 per thousand cubic feet. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings another $250 million. Negative sales timing effects, reduced demand, and increased downtime were partly offset by new project volumes. All other items further decreased earnings by $430 million. This is largely the result of asset management activity and higher operating expenses. Asset management impacts included our relinquishment of East Natuna, located offshore Indonesia, as we continue to high-grade our portfolio.", "Moving to slide 12, sequentially volumes decreased 5.5% or 229,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Liquids production decreased 64,000 barrels per day, driven by higher downtime. Natural gas production decreased 988 million cubic feet per day, as seasonal demand dropped significantly, but were partly offset by new project volumes and work program.", "Moving now to Downstream financial and operating results, starting on slide 13, Downstream earnings for the quarter were $1.4 billion, up $560 million compared to the second quarter of 2016. Stronger margins increased earnings by $220 million. Favorable volume and mix effects improved earnings by $90 million, mainly from lower planned maintenance, which resulted in higher throughput. All other items added $250 million, mostly from ongoing asset management activities, favorable foreign exchange effects, and lower turnaround costs.", "Turning to slide 14, Downstream earnings increased sequentially by $269 million. Stronger margins increased earnings by $200 million. Volume and mix effects improved earnings by $40 million, primarily driven by increased fuel sales. All other items further increased earnings by $30 million.", "Moving now to Chemical financial and operating results, starting on slide 15, second quarter Chemical earnings were $985 million, down $232 million compared to the prior-year quarter. Weaker commodity margins decreased earnings by $40 million. Lower commodity volumes reduced earnings by $50 million. And all other items decreased earnings by $140 million, largely due to increased turnaround expenses and unfavorable foreign exchange effects.", "Moving to slide 16, Chemical earnings decreased sequentially by $186 million. Weaker commodity margins reduced earnings by $100 million. And all other items decreased earnings $90 million, primarily from increased turnaround and project-related expenses.", "Turning to slide 17 and a review of our Upstream business highlights, we continued to capture new high-quality acreage with recent portfolio additions offshore Australia, Equatorial Guinea, and Suriname. ExxonMobil will be the operator of each of these new blocks, with total over 3.5 million gross acres. While appraising the Muruk discovery in Papua New Guinea, we confirmed the presence of a second gas-bearing fault block. Production testing confirmed good quality reservoir with high deliverability. Further appraisal is needed to delineate this resource, but this discovery has helped to derisk several other leads, on trend with the fields in this area.", "In June, we successfully completed the tow-out and installation of the Hebron Platform, located offshore Eastern Canada. The 750,000-ton platform was towed over 350 kilometers from the Bull Arm construction site to the Hebron field in the Jeanne d'Arc Basin. The facility is capable of producing 150,000 barrels per day, with a total estimated recovery of more than 700 million barrels of oil. Commissioning work is progressing and drilling began this month. The field is expected to start up before year end.", "The Odoptu Stage 2 project also remains on track for first oil by year end. A major milestone was achieved in June, when the final facility modules arrived on Sakhalin Island.", "Turning now to slide 18, we continue to make strong progress in the Greater Guyana-Suriname region. We recently announced the signing of a production sharing contract for Block 59 offshore Suriname. The 2.8 million-acre block will be operated by ExxonMobil with co-venturers Hess and Statoil. Block 59 is in deep water located approximately 190 miles in the Guyana-Suriname Basin. We look forward to leveraging our regional knowledge to help evaluate the block's potential.", "In Guyana, we're currently acquiring a large 3-D seismic survey over the Kaieteur block to assess resource potential. Also, the rig is currently on the Payara 2 delineation well, and initial results are encouraging. We've encountered nearly 60 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone, deeper than the previous lowest known oil in the first Payara well. This brings the total Payara discovery to about 500 million oil equivalent barrels.", "As a result, total gross recoverable resources on Stabroek Block are now estimated at 2.3 billion to 2.8 billion oil equivalent barrels. This higher estimate is driven by the results of Payara 2 and the previous Liza-4 well, which encountered more than 197 feet of high quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoir. The rig will next move to drill the Turbot and then Ranger prospects. These two prospects represent new play tests on the Stabroek Block.", "Moving to slide 19 and still in Guyana, we reached final investment decision on Phase 1 of the Liza development. First oil is expected by 2020, less than five years after the initial discovery. Phase 1 will develop 450 million barrels of oil from a floating production, storage, and offloading vessel, with production capacity of 120,000 barrels per day. This development is expected to cost $4.4 billion, resulting in a unit development cost of less than $10 per barrel and a projected double-digit return, even in a flat $40 per barrel price environment. The combination of high resource quality and proven execution capabilities applied in today's lower-cost environment positions Liza for success.", "Development planning for a second phase has also progressed following the recent success at Liza 4, which confirms significant additional resources that underpin future phases. Successful well test of Liza 4 confirmed the anticipated superior well deliverability expected from this high-quality reservoir. We are certainly excited about the tremendous potential of Liza, Payara, and the greater Guyana Basin, and we look forward to working with the government and of course the people of Guyana in the years to come to develop this world-class asset.", "Moving to slide 20 for an update on our Permian development, ExxonMobil's Permian assets rank among the top-tier investment returns in our global portfolio. Strong drilling and completion execution in the Midland Basin has to date yielded unit development costs of about $7.00 per oil equivalent barrel. We've been steadily increasing our Permian drilling activity through 2017. And our current net production is more than 165,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, an increase of 20% from the prior-year quarter.", "Despite growing industry activity in the Permian, we have successfully offset inflationary pressure through increased efficiencies and high recoveries per well. And this includes, amongst other factors, a continuing reduction in drilling days and cost per foot as well as further improvement in completion designs. We currently have 16 operated rigs in the Delaware and Midland Basins combined, and expect to reach 19 total rigs by the end of August.", "Specifically in the Delaware Basin, we just finished drilling our first operated well on the recently acquired acreage. This well has a lateral section of 12,500 feet, well above the industry average. As we further progress development and gain additional learning curve benefits, we anticipate extending lateral lengths, including leveraging our learnings from our recent completion of Bakken horizontal wells of over 3 miles. Our superior, highly contiguous acreage position in the Delaware Basin uniquely positions us to exploit longer laterals and drive down unit development costs.", "We also continue to optimize our logistics and infrastructure plans, including export capacity, gas gathering, and water handling. For example, ExxonMobil recently executed an agreement for Summit Midstream Partners to develop, own, and operate a new associated gas gathering and processing system servicing the northern Delaware Basin. I'm pleased with our progress to date, and anticipate that as activity continues to ramp up, we will continue capturing efficiencies. Our estimated unit development costs for the full northern Delaware acreage is $5 to $7 per oil equivalent barrel.", "Turning to slide 21 and our Downstream and Chemical business highlights, we continue to strengthen our portfolio by increasing feedstock and logistics flexibility, upgrading the value of hydrocarbon molecules, and expanding volumes of premium products. In May, we reached mechanical completion of two new 650,000 ton per year polyethylene lines at our plant in Mont Belvieu, Texas. The company expects production to begin during the third quarter of this year.", "Building on the success of our Gulf Coast initiatives, the corporation also continues to advance new opportunities to meet growing demand for ethylene and related products. We recently selected a site in South Texas for our proposed joint venture with SABIC to construct a world-scale petrochemical complex, including an ethane steam cracker and a monoethylene glycol unit and two polyethylene units. In May, the venture partner signed an agreement for the next phase of the project, which enables planning for front-end engineering and design work.", "Recognizing that Asia-Pacific continues to be the largest and fastest growing lubes market globally, we recently completed the expansion of our grease and synthetic lubricants operations in Singapore. The new synthetic lubricants plant is the only facility in the region that can manufacture Mobil 1.", "We're also increasing our basestock capacity in Asia, with the further expansion of our Group II production in Singapore. This value-driven investment underpins our continued leadership in basestock production.", "In the quarter, ExxonMobil also announced its plans to enter the Mexican fuel market with Mobil-branded stations and its advanced Synergy gasoline and diesel fuels. Through local partnerships, we plan to open our first Mobil service station in central Mexico during the second half of 2017, with additional stations to follow by year end. We plan to invest about $300 million in fuels, logistics, product inventories, and marketing over the next 10 years to provide a reliable supply of quality products to retail, wholesale, industrial, and commercial sectors.", "Finally, we continue to invest in research and development to position our long-term success. ExxonMobil and Synthetic Genomics have jointly researched biofuels for over eight years, and recently announced a breakthrough involving the modification of an algae strain that more than doubled its oil production. We are pleased to have achieved this important milestone, and we'll continue to progress the potential commercial application over the longer term.", "Turning to slide 22, we are also progressing a strategic acquisition in Singapore to grow our chemical capacity to meet increasing Asian product demand. ExxonMobil signed an agreement with Jurong Aromatics Corporation to acquire its plant, located on Jurong Island in Singapore. This aromatics plant is one of the largest in the world, with an annual production capacity of 1.4 million tons and also produces 65,000 barrels per day of fuels. Integration of this plant with ExxonMobil's existing manufacturing facility will provide product, operational, and logistical synergies that will enable cost-competitive growth of the aromatics business.", "As you may know, Singapore is home to ExxonMobil's largest integrated refining and petrochemical complex and has a crude oil processing capacity of almost 600,000 barrels per day, and includes two world-scale steam crackers with a capacity of 1.9 million tons per annum. Acquisition of the Jurong Aromatics plant will increase ExxonMobil's Singapore aromatics production to over 3.5 million tons per year, of which 1.8 million tons is paraxylene, used in polyester production. We're looking forward to closing this acquisition in the second half of this year.", "Turning now to slide 23, a summary of the corporation's year-to-date sources and uses of cash highlights our ability to meet our financial objectives and commitment to our shareholders. As shown, year-to-date 2017 cash flow from operations and asset sales of $16 billion funded shareholder distributions, net investments in the business, and a reduction in debt.", "Following the most recent drop in commercial prices, this is the third consecutive quarter where our free cash flow has exceeded our dividends to shareholders, reflecting capital discipline and the strength of the integrated businesses. And I'll note that the cash operating surplus in the second quarter is after covering a seasonal working capital build.", "Moving now to the final slide, I'll conclude today's presentation with a summary of our year-to-date performance. Simply put, we remain focused on value growth through self-help and attractive investments. Our integrated businesses continue to generate solid cash flow and earnings. Our business segments collectively earned $7.4 billion, an increase of nearly $4 billion compared to the first half of 2016.", "Upstream production volumes were consistent with plans at 4 million oil equivalent barrels per day. We remain disciplined in our investment program, selectively advancing strategic opportunities across the value chain while maintaining focus on capital efficiencies.", "Year-to-date CapEx was $8.1 billion, a decrease of 21% from the prior year. Our capital guidance for 2017 remains at $22 billion, as we previously shared. Cash flow from operations and asset sales totaled $16 billion and free cash flow was $8.5 billion, more than covering $6.4 billion in shareholder distributions.", "Due to the strength of our integrated businesses, we remain confident in ExxonMobil's ability to continue delivering long-term value to our shareholders in ever-changing industry conditions.", "That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be very happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Woodbury. And we'll go first to Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs.", "Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi, Jeff. How are you?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Good morning, Neil. I'm doing fine, thank you.", "Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Jeff, I asked you this question last quarter, but I always value your opinion on the oil macro. I just wanted to get ExxonMobil's perspective as a buyer of 5 million barrels a day of crude of where do you think we are in the rebalancing process and how you see the macro playing out going forward.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Thanks, Neil. Let me just give you some observations. On the positive side, clearly demand continues to be relatively strong when you compare it against the 10-year average. We're likely to see demand growth about 1.5 million barrels this year. We are seeing some inventories, commercial inventories draw both on crude as well as products. Still quite a bit of inventory to go ahead and draw down.", "Of course, on the opposite side, working against the balances that we are seeing a significant build in production in several places, notably in North America, right now pretty much on trend to reach about an additional 1 million barrel a day capacity growth over the last, say, 12 to 18 months by year end. That's going to work against us in some regards. And of course, how other non-OPEC producers perform over the near term will have an effect.", "When you put all that together, you are seeing convergence of supply/demand in the second half of 2017. That will probably spread out again as demand drops in the first half of 2018. But I think I'd summarize by saying that we are seeing some progress towards a healthier balance. But as I indicated, there are a lot of variables in play.", "Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "I appreciate those comments. The follow-up is on gas. You have a lot of optionality on global gas with PNG, with the InterOil acquisition, Mozambique, and there's talk about the potential for expansion in Qatar. Can you just comment on each of the three opportunities and then how Exxon is thinking about prioritizing the different options you might have here?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "As you said, Neil, we do have a lot of optionality here. As part of our diverse resource base, we've got a very large presence in gas. We see gas, as you may recall from our energy outlook, growing about 1.5% per year between now and 2040, so that really sets up the investment basis. We're progressing all of these opportunities forward. As you can appreciate, there are a lot of variables that will determine the pace, and some of these will likely move quicker than others.", "When you think about the full spectrum of the portfolio, those that are what I would characterize as brownfield expansions of existing operations are probably going to add some of the lowest cost of supply. I'd note specifically Papua New Guinea, where we have built up a very substantial resource base, starting with the foundation project that has exceeded the original scope in terms of offtake and total resource, to the success of our exploration program. And as you know, the acquisition of the InterOil assets, that positions us very well to expand that facility, and I'd suggest that that's going to be on the left side of the cost of supply curve. To some other very large resources, like the acquisitions we're pursuing in Mozambique that are also going to be very competitive on a cost and supply, as well as our continued interest in supporting the objective of our partners in Qatar, which we take a lot of pride in supporting their ultimate plans for the North Field.", "Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Operator", "And we'll now take our next question from Doug Leggate of Bank of America.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good morning, Jeff. Can you hear me okay?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Yes, I can, Doug. Good morning.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, a couple things, maybe two questions, if I may. The first one is on volumes in the second quarter. Is there anything unusual going on in Europe? I know that production is typically seasonally weak annually, but it just looks \u2013 down about 20% year over year looks unusually low. And related, I guess Canada volumes, oil volumes were down also, and I'm guessing that's maintenance. Can you speak to some of the moving parts in the quarter? Because obviously international E&P seemed weak. And we're just trying to get a handle on whether there's something changing here which has some leaks, or if it's really just one-off seasonality? And I got a follow-up, please.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Thanks for the question, Doug, and you're right. We are pretty low in the second quarter, and there are a couple of drivers for that, as I said my prepared comments. We saw pretty significant downtime in a couple of regions, one being Canada, as you highlighted. We had a turnaround in Kearl. We also, as has been pretty well publicized, Syncrude has been down. We expect Syncrude to ramp up to full capacity by August. Staying on the liquids side, we had some downtime in Nigeria and West Africa as well. The second quarter tends to have a lot more of our planned maintenance activities in the upstream.", "On the gas side, one of the biggest drops was the reduction in the European gas demand. Of course, that is seasonal in nature. On top of that, as I said in my prepared comments, there are some impacts associated with the regulatory restrictions at Groningen.", "On the positive side, I think it's important to highlight that we've had some really significant builds, and some of these projects have come on really good progress in places like Upper Zakum, Kashagan. We continue to ramp up some of our additional projects that started up over the last one or two years.", "And then the last negative I'd highlight, which is real clear on the chart, is that there was a significant liquids decrease associated with entitlement volumes, which as you know, is really a price-driven impact.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, I appreciate the lengthy answer, thanks. I guess my follow-up, I realize you just reiterated the spending guidance for the year, Jeff, but realistically you're running very light at the half-year level. Even with the Bakken loaded spending, the number still looks a little bit aggressive on the back end. Can you just speak to that in terms of are you just being really conservative here, or do you really expect that significant ramp up in the run rate spending in the second half of the year? And I'll leave it there, thanks.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Thank you, Doug. Well I can certainly appreciate that view, and we are spending lower, if you will, on a season-wise basis. And I'd bucket them into really two categories, one being timing-related, and the second one being that the organization has continued to make significant efforts to capture new efficiencies, and we are seeing those capital efficiencies in that performance.", "On the timing side, we got a couple things that I'll share with you. One obviously is we've got two acquisitions that we are working to close by the end of the year, the two being Mozambique and the Jurong Aromatics Corporation acquisition. We also, as I indicated in my prepared comments, are ramping up our Permian activity as well. Those factors lead us to the view that we want to keep the guidance flat. In some regards, you can say there's some upward pressure to that, but we've got full confidence in the organization that we'll continue to capture additional savings as we go forward.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Doug Terreson of Evercore ISI.", "Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Good morning, Doug.", "Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC", "You made a point a few minutes ago about growing value, and several of your peers have become much more focused on return on capital employed during the past year. And besides more disciplined spending, they've increased divestitures to try and realize greater value from their portfolios. And because returns for all companies have declined over the past couple of years and because you pulled this lever slightly less than your peers over time, not a ton less but slightly less, my question is, how do you guys think about the opportunity for value creation from this mechanism? Meaning it's not new, but are there reasons to step up or not step up your program at this time given the current environment where assets are starting to pretty freely trade hands?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Yeah Doug, just a couple thoughts to share with you on that regard. First, I'd also say that we have had a continual asset management program, and we've shared the total value benefit from that in the past. But when you look at that, for us it's not a defined we're going to sell X amount of assets over a defined timeframe. It's an ongoing focus around how do you high-grade the overall portfolio. And I can share three key components of doing that.", "One is clearly identifying new highly accretive assets that can compete in your portfolio through exploration activity or acquisitions. And then the second one, the last one being that this ongoing program to monetize what we see as assets that may be of greater value to others. And if you look at our annual performance on that, we're selling anywhere between $2 billion to $4 billion of assets per year. If you look at, say, over the last five years, that equates to about over $20 billion from those asset sales.", "So we maintain a very active program. This is not a fire sale. This is all about the fundamental objective of this corporation is to grow value, and the decisions are value-based. If we see that we can get that value through monetizing it through a sale, then we'll go ahead and proceed with it. But we like the portfolio. We've been very successful in ensuring that there's a constant high-grading of that portfolio.", "And then you think in the \u2013 I want to talk about the broader comment about return on capital employed. The fundamental objective of our investment program is to be very selective on how we can grow our value proposition, and ultimately that will evidence itself in the return on capital employed. If you think about from the Upstream through the Downstream and Chemicals, it's all about that value chain investment to provide accretive financial performance. So very strong discipline, and we've never lost our view on that.", "Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC", "Okay. And then also, Jeff, the Downstream has historically been an area of industry leadership for ExxonMobil, and needless to say, it still is. But in this area, your results seem to have lagged your peers during the past 6 to 12 months, again, not a ton but there seems to be a little leakage. And so my question was whether or not you had any insight into this outcome, not so much from a return on capital perspective, which is probably explained by changes in pre-productive capital with your new projects. But is there anything from a margin or earnings perspective or anything else that might be worth mentioning about the Downstream performance?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "The only thing I would share with you on that, Doug, that again I'm not sure what your reference point is, but we did have a fairly heavy maintenance period in the first half of the year.", "Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC", "Okay.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "I think we completed about 85% of our overall planned maintenance in the first six months of the year. I will focus also on the very strategic investments that we're making throughout the Downstream. It's a good example of how we're not necessarily growing volume but we're going value, where we're going ahead and upgrading lower-value products like marine fuel oil to higher-value products like ultra-low sulfur diesel or lube basestocks. Specific projects, Antwerp is doing that. Rotterdam is doing that using proprietary technology. Should take us to the largest Group II basestock producer in Europe. So it really demonstrates how the investment is very focused, very strategic, and all underpins that value proposition.", "Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC", "Okay, thanks a lot, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Thank you, Doug.", "Operator", "And we'll now move next to Sam Margolin of Cowen & Company.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hey, Jeff. How are you?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Good morning, Sam.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "I guess we'll start with Liza just because it sounds like there has been some developments there. So as the recoverable resource reserve gets bigger and bigger, are there any other factors in place with the development that might be changing? Is this project getting more complicated or less complicated as you're building economies of scale? And just curious about your thoughts around development impacts of the resource increasing in ongoing discoveries.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "The short answer is we really like what we've got, Sam, and we've got significant scope to continue to increase the resource. As you can see, we've grown the acreage substantially to I think about 14 million gross acres now with the additional pickup of Suriname.", "Yes, clearly you can see the model that we've employed here is that we're trying to get production or a revenue stream on pretty quick through this leased FPSO approach. Five years from discovery to startup is industry leading. At the same time, we'll continue to maintain the ongoing exploration and appraisal program. That, as you've seen in our recent communication, has continued to build the resource base, positioning us for subsequent phases of development.", "And you can see the analogue we've got here with what we did in Angola Block 15, where we got out there early with a leased FPSO to get a revenue stream on it. We maintained our exploration program. We built mass. It allows us to get into much more of a manufacturing process. We designed one template and then we go ahead and build that template throughout the development of the resource. And that allows us ultimately to make this value proposition that I talked about with Doug previously, drive that unit development cost down, and maximize the results.", "So as I indicated in my prepared comments, very excited about where we are, a lot of activity going on and a lot of scope. This is exactly what we want to be doing right now.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay, that's really helpful. Thanks. And then I guess moving on to Permian, since you're accelerating there currently right now too, you did mention some inflation, but you have offsets with efficiencies and application of some I guess development techniques that you've developed in other areas. Is there any critical mass? Is there any tipping point there, or do you think that you'll continue to be able to beat out these inflationary trends with production technique? Just because it does sound like you're adding rigs and laterals are getting longer. Service intensity does seem to be increasing.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Yeah, well I mean clearly as I indicated previously, we are really trying to keep the organization focused on progressing various structural efficiency savings going forward. As I said in the prepared comments, it's through some of the execution, but it's also driving our unit development costs down, leveraging the global scale of our organization through our procurement business. And we've got that unique structure. We've the procurement organization that's really focused on driving the cost down over the lifecycle of the asset, and across the business have made significant gains. If I back up and talk corporate-wide, we are seeing some inflationary pressures. They're very localized on specific services, but the organization is fully offsetting those costs as we go forward.", "Taking it down to Permian, we're being very strategic in terms of our forward development planning and execution. I mentioned by way of example, we're thinking about the logistical and the supply chain requirements. So we're planning on all that, and all that effort is driving that unit development cost down and offsetting those inflationary pressures.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thanks so much.", "Operator", "And now we'll go to Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hi, good morning, Jeff. Just a quick one, on the buyback, will you continue with the anti-dilutionary buybacks, or is it all suspended?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Good morning, Paul. Yes, we will, to the extent that we are buying or need to maintain anti-dilution, but right now in the quarter we didn't have any.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay, but it might continue in Q3?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "It's usually a couple \u2013 I don't remember which month it is, Paul, but it's really tied to our overall benefits plans. Typically we see in it the first quarter. But it's...", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay, thanks. That's good enough, Jeff. Go ahead.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Go ahead, Paul.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "No, I was going to suddenly change the subject. Could you talk through Mozambique? There's been \u2013 obviously you've made a significant move there. Could you just outline what's going on there? Thank you.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Sure, so Mozambique, as I indicated when Neil asked the question, is clearly another big opportunity for us to leverage our capabilities, to really go ahead and bring what we think is going to be a very competitive cost of supply to market.", "As we announced earlier this year, we went ahead and executed an agreement with Eni to pick up indirect interest of about 25%. That's a cash transaction that was valued at about $2.8 billion, but it is subject to government approvals, and that's what we're working through right now. In that arrangement, ExxonMobil will take responsibility for operating the midstream, which will involve leading the construction and operation of onshore facilities.", "I will tell you that when we get to that point once we've gotten the necessary approvals and we are able to close the transaction, we'll get involved certainly with all the co-ventures, the government, and even Area 1 to look at how further synergies can be captured, recognizing the potential growth and development in that specific area. But I'd say a very large resource. Area 4 contains more 85 trillion cubic feet in place. And we think it's going to compete very well on the left side of that cost of supply curve.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Understood. And just forgive me for asking three, but the situation in Qatar and the announcement from Qatar on expansion, firstly, how have the sanctions in any way impacted you? And secondly, how would that fit going forward in terms of the massive expansion that they've announced?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "So there are no sanctions with Qatar, but I think what you're referring to is the diplomatic issues amongst the Middle Eastern countries.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Right. Yes, obviously not the U.S. sanctions, yes.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Yes. Simply put, we've not experienced any impacts to LNG production or exports.", "With respect to the aspirations of Qatar to further expand their LNG capacity, I'd put it this way, Paul, that as you know, Qatar is a very important partnership for us. We are very proud of the contributions that we made in supporting Qatar's evolution as what we believe is the world's largest LNG supplier of LNG. As you look forward, we'll continue to support Qatar. We're very interested in future investments, and we're very interested in supporting their stated objectives. It's a very strong relationship, and I think we're very well positioned.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Thank you, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Thank you, Paul.", "Operator", "And we'll now move to Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hey. Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Good morning, Evan", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "I had a quick question on Guyana, where you've had great success. Given the returns, better returns I presume, at the top of your gating process, how do you think about accelerating subsequent developments to maximize the value of this resource base? Meaning with several phases underpinned past Liza, is there a scope for a faster pace of development than Kizomba or faster than an FPSO every two to three years? What are the thoughts there?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "It's a great question, and I think it really talks to the development planning process that we go through. We're doing a lot of this activity in parallel. We took our largest 3D seismic acquisition. We're analyzing that. We're integrating real-time the drill well data that we're collecting, and we're building that into the process. One of the ways to get that faster pace is being able to put in place a standard template as we go forward and develop these assets.", "As I indicated in my prepared comments, we're already looking at the subsequent phases in Guyana. And to the extent that we can standardize that template, I think it's going to allow us to move quicker. But it goes right back to the fundamental objective that we're looking for, and that is how do we maximize the value for this investment. And we'll certainly keep a very close watch on where we can capture through learning curve benefits additional capital efficiencies.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "But it sounds like Kizomba is a good model for now. Is that fair?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Yes, it was a very successful outcome for the corporation, and it certainly demonstrated its value proposition, and it's a good model going forward. Now of course, our desire is to just continue to see additional success in our exploration program.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. The second, in the Permian, there's a chart on slide 20. It's the chart at the bottom right. It seems to indicate the potential for up to a 20,000-foot lateral. That's clearly a function of your contiguous position, and I also know you guys hold the record in lateral drilling in Sakhalin conventional. Can you talk about plans to test at that length or discuss \u2013 is it too early or could you discuss any technical challenges you see from either completion or equipment perspective? And that's it, a pretty long lateral.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Thanks for your question, Evan. This is in our wheelhouse. It's all about leveraging our technology to achieve these types of aspirational objectives. A couple data points I'd give you. One is, as you indicated, we've got very strong success with our drilling execution. We've got a number of execution processes that allows us to fully analyze the physics associated with drilling that allows us to overcome some of the impediments to be able to achieve those type of outcomes.", "The second point I'd make, as I said in my comments, we just finished drilling over 3-mile long Bakken wells. That's allowed us to really inform ourselves, and that's all being integrated real-time into our ongoing \u2013 let me say our ongoing unconventional drilling program, but notably in the Permian. So it's a very strong focus on thinking about what are those limiting factors and how do we push it out even further.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "I look forward to hear.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Okay.", "Operator", "We will now go to Phil Gresh of JPMorgan.", "Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, good morning, Jeff. Sorry about that. First question is around the capital spending and the acquisition, the two acquisitions you're talking about. Could you quantify those for me? I know what Jurong and Mozambique is. But if you put the two together, how much of an impact is that on the full-year guidance?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Hey. Good morning, Phil. The Mozambique acquisition, as I said, was $2.8 billion. The Jurong Aromatics acquisition, the actual acquisition price has been confidential. It's not been disclosed.", "Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. So I guess as I think about \u2013 I guess I'm asking a similar question again here. But as I think about your comments about including those numbers in the full-year guidance of $22 billion, and you talk about some upward pressure from inflation, is there also a significant increase in activity level you're expecting in the second half of the year? I'm just trying to tie out why we'd have such a big increase in the back half.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Yes, sure, a couple points that I'll just reiterate. One is we are seeing some very good progress beyond what we had in our business plan in terms of some additional efficiency benefits that we're capturing. But there is a lot of timing implications associated with not only the acquisitions in the second half, but we've got, as I said, the ramp up in our Permian activity. But also there's a number of big projects that just the spend profile ends up being a little bit more skewed to the second half of the year, particularly in our development company and our Chemical business.", "Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And I guess as we think about the longer-term guidance that you gave at the Analyst Day of $25 billion annualized 2018 through 2020, I guess is what you're implying here that the second half ramp is the reason we get to the run rate of about $25 billion for the next couple years, up from $22 billion this year?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Yes, it's a good question, Phil. I understand where you're going with it. I wouldn't try to anchor the second half 2017 spend on the projection that we provided in the analyst meeting for 2018 forward. Ballpark, we're going to see anywhere between $20 billion to $25 billion going forward. We're pretty comfortable with the range that we had provided earlier this year as an outlook out to 2020. It's going to moderate based on progress on certain projects and some new opportunities that have been brought into the portfolio. So as a rule going forward, if you think that we stick with around $22 billion in 2017, slowly ramping up through the end of the decade is the way I think about it.", "Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Sure, that makes sense. Thanks a lot.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Okay. Thank you, Phil.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Brendan Warn of BMO Capital Markets.", "Brendan Warn - BMO Capital Markets Ltd.", "Thanks, Jeff. Thanks for the opportunity to ask a question. Just back on Liza or Guyana, I just want to ask a question about Turbot and Ranger. You talk about them as being, call it, new play tests. Are they different, call it, horizons, different prospect types? Can you just probably expand on that comment in terms of what are the additional risks related to the step-outs on that block?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Thanks for raising that, Brendan, because it is an important point to make because any type of ranked well-cap exploration has got a fairly material risk to it. Turbot is still in the upper cretaceous. It's still a stratigraphic trap, but it is in a different fairway or depositional environment than Liza, Snoek, and Payara. The Ranger prospect, the analysis that we've done really suggests a large carbonate buildup. So higher risk and uncertainty, but obviously we see the potential as being material to justify that risk profile.", "Brendan Warn - BMO Capital Markets Ltd.", "Actually the follow-up to that then, if it's carbonate, are we talking the same source from the Cenomanian-Turonian?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "I'm sorry, Brendan. Can you say that once again?", "Brendan Warn - BMO Capital Markets Ltd.", "So for Ranger, is it still the same source rock from the CT?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Maybe, it's probably early to fully conclude that, but potentially. As I indicated earlier, we've got a lot of things going on in parallel right now in our analytical work.", "Brendan Warn - BMO Capital Markets Ltd.", "Okay. Thanks, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank has our next question.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks, Jeff, maybe one high-level question on your thoughts around the Gulf Coast initiatives that you have down there. Can you talk a little bit about the potential expansions that you see there? I know with some of them you talked about the potential petchem expansions. Are there likely to be refining expansions?", "And how do see the Gulf Coast region? Do you see it as a strategically advantaged location for exports of everything from refined products to petchems? And how does that figure into your long-term strategic plans there?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "In fact, you answered where I was going to start. Strategically, it's very well positioned in terms of the feed advantage, the unconventional resource base, the infrastructure and the linkage on that infrastructure, the integration that we have throughout our facilities, the full integration of fuels, lubricants, and petrochemicals, the logistics capability. All those factors really position it very well.", "As part of our Gulf Coast initiatives program, we've had a number of very successful projects that we've implemented. The ones that are in progress right now is obviously the big Baytown expansion. That adds another 1.5 million tons per annum of ethylene capacity. I referenced in my prepared comments the corresponding polyethylene trains that are starting up in the third quarter. We've got an expansion going on at Beaumont for additional polyethylene trains. And then we've got the big greenfield development down in South Texas potentially with our partner SABIC that will add that additional 1.8 million tons of additional ethylene capacity and then associated derivative units.", "And now on the Upstream side, we are still moving forward with an assessment of the Golden Pass LNG export facility. You may be aware that in April of this year that the Department of Energy finally authorized Golden Pass to export LNG to countries that do not have free trade agreements with the U.S. That was really one of the last big significant authorizations we were looking for. And now we're focused more on bringing together all the remaining elements to really position the project for a potential final investment decision, specifically looking at and updating the technical and commercial details at this point. So that's a high-level summary of the benefits of what we see the Gulf Coast brings as well as the investments that we're progressing.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great, thanks. It's mostly I guess petchem and LNG. Are we likely to see any type of refining expansion down there?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "As part of this whole Gulf Coast initiative, we have made some investments to expand. For instance in Beaumont, we added something like 20,000 barrels a day of additional feedstock capacity that allow us to have the capability of bringing in more of the unconventional feedstock or production for feedstock. So we've made a lot of investments to really focus in on the following areas, either building logistics flexibility, building feedstock flexibility, but importantly, focused on the integrated benefits of the facilities and really increasing the value of the products that we make at those manufacturing sites.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks. And maybe as a quick follow-up on that, I saw the announcement of the expansion there in Mexico. How big of an opportunity could this be?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "We're certainly pleased with the business climate where it has moved to. It's an attractive market for, as we just were talking about, our Gulf Coast refining. We have a reliable facility, and this is a good outlet. We've had a very long history in Mexico, and I think it positions us well.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great, thank you.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will move next to Roger Read of Wells Fargo.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hey. Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Good morning, Roger.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Maybe to just come back to CapEx real quick so I can understand some of the moving parts here, the two acquisitions, are those going to be cash-only or cash and shares? I'm just trying to think of the impact on cash flow in the second half.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Those will be cash transactions.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. And then as we think about the guidance that CapEx slowly trends higher through the end of the decade, presumably you don't build acquisitions into that CapEx assumption. So should we think about that as field development, exploration, et cetera, the CapEx spending, or should we build in an acquisition expectation in that?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "By and large, you're exactly right. Unless there's something that's in the works that we feel fairly confident with, we will not include it in that projection. Now I'll be clear. Mozambique was in that outlook we shared in March during that analyst meeting. We just didn't highlight it because it wasn't ready for prime time. But we'll go ahead, and depending on where we are, we'll represent it accordingly. Important to highlight is that we've got a very \u2013 and you know this, Roger, we've got a very strong balance sheet. It allows us to capitalize on the moments, regardless of where we are in the commodity price cycle. And I think you just look back over the last six to nine months, we've been able to pick up four very accretive, very high-quality assets that really meet the objective that we're trying to achieve with high-grading the portfolio.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "No absolutely, I appreciate the longer-term view that you're able to take. And then my follow-up question, I think it was slide 20, estimated project development costs in the Delaware Basin of $5 to $7 per BOE. Multiple benches out there, so is the $5 to $7 looking at the development over the course of 10 or 15 or longer years, or is this the way to think about Phase 1?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "If you remember when we communicated the acquisition, we laid out a long-term development expectation, a certain level of rig activity. Total buildup I think was about 350,000-plus oil equivalent barrels per day, so it was a long-term view of the development of this northern acreage in the Delaware. That's what that represents. It's the overall assessed scope that we had built in to develop it based on, if you will, our technical assessment that underpinned our decision to go ahead and assess or acquire the asset.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Thank you, Roger.", "Operator", "And now we'll move next to Blake Fernandez of Scotia Howard Weil.", "Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil", "Hey, Jeff. Good morning. I was hoping to go back to the volume question, the production question. I know you already tackled the European rollover, but I'm trying to get a sense of how much is associated with just pure seasonality and how much is more regulatory Groningen effect. Is there a way you can quantify the quarter-to-quarter change that's down about 159,000 barrels a day in gas? Can you quantify how much of that is actually Groningen?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Yes, so if you look on quarter to the prior quarter, my recollection is about 90 million cubic feet per day was associated with the cap impact. That was the second quarter 2017 to the second quarter of 2016.", "Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil", "Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. The second question is on your slide showing the free cash flow above dividend. You had mentioned your debt has definitely been working down over the past year, and I guess I'm just trying to understand the appetite for reimplementing the buyback program over and above offsetting dilution versus reinvestment into the business. Obviously, you've got a whole host of acquisitions that are underway, so it seems to me like your appetite is more geared toward acquisition opportunities rather than buying back stock. But I just didn't know if you had any commentary you could offer there.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Blake, I'd pitch it this way, that if an opportunity comes along from an acquisition perspective that we think would be very competitive to our existing investment portfolio, we're certainly going to go ahead and pursue it. And as I said earlier, we have the financial capability to do that regardless of where we are in the commodity price cycle.", "The buyback decision really steps back, and I think I've mentioned this before. If you think about our capital allocation approach, it really is founded on being committed to a reliable and growing dividend and at the same time continuing to invest in accretive investment opportunities. With the remaining cash, then the decision is around how do you put that to additional work, how do you distribute it to your shareholders if you feel that's appropriate. And that's really viewed on a quarterly basis where we step and we consider is there some debt that's maturing that we'll go ahead and close out, or does it make sense to go ahead and purchase some shares with it.", "So think about it as a separate \u2013 it's part of the overall cash management that we'll consider that on. But we like the trend we're on. And regardless of what commodity prices do, if you pick up anything from me, it's one of through our self-help and through our investment program, we are building value.", "Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil", "Understood, thank you.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "We will now move to Paul Cheng of Barclays.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, guys. Good morning.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Good morning, Paul.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Jeff, on the warning, can I go back? In Africa year over year there's a 50 target in your liquid production. I think you mentioned that you have healthier than, maybe healthier turnaround activities there. But you also have a sale of I think some Nigerian operation. So I'm trying to understand that. How big is the job year over year? In the first half of the year it's related to sale, or is that more structural? And how much is really just more activity? And also you mentioned in your prepared remarks you have a underlift this quarter, 150,000 barrels per day. Do you have an earnings impact related that?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Yes, so a couple points. On the first one you were talking about the decline that we've seen in our Africa volumes, and there are several things that are driving that. One has to do with natural decline in Africa. The second one has to do with there has been a reasonable amount of downtime that we've experienced. And then the third one that I mentioned earlier was the entitlement impacts due to the commodity prices. I would summarize that those are probably the three key areas that are driving the volumes in Africa right now.", "The second question about the underlift and the earnings impact, it's a large part of that component. I think it's in excess of $100 million-plus earnings impact associated with it on a quarter-on-quarter basis.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "And the final one on Liza, in Phase 1 you're reinjecting the gas. I think the estimated gas resource is maybe about 20% of the total BOE, or maybe a little bit more, a little bit less. In the future phases, will you be able to still just reinject, or do you actually have to fund the infrastructure to develop it? And if that's the case, given that the a lack of infrastructure over there, what kind of cost component that we may be talking about?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Yes, well Paul, as you said in the Phase 1, the plan is that we will reinject the gas into the reservoir. Going forward in subsequent phases, obviously that's a key aspect of our development planning efforts. I think it's probably too early to signal where we end up on that, but that will certainly be an area of dialogue with the resource owner and making sure that we're meeting their objectives as well.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "I see. All right, thank you.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Thank you, Paul.", "Operator", "We will now move to Anish Kapadia of Tudor, Pickering, Holt.", "Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP", "Hi, Jeff. Just a first question on the overall LNG market. You're obviously seen (74:48) announcement, yourselves adding quite a lot of potential capacity over the next decade from Mozambique. So I was just wondering, how have your conversations been with LNG buyers? Have you signed any deals this year in terms of your future projects? Because obviously, we've see on the other side of the equation companies canceling projects such as a large project in Canada that was announced in the last week or so. I just wanted to get an idea of how those conversations with the LNG buyers are going.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Yes, well I guess a couple points to share with you, Anish. First, again, our forward-looking perspective around the LNG development opportunity is really underpinned by our energy outlook, which with gas growing at 1.5% per year throughout the period out to 2040, that translates into LNG capacity growing 2.5 times.", "As it relates to our interaction with potential buyers, obviously, I can't share the specifics. That's part of those confidential discussions, but I will note that there have been a number of announcements that we've released regarding heads of agreements, one of them having to be, I think was in Indonesia for an extended period sale. There were others that were announced. I just don't have them all in front of me, Anish.", "But I think the message you should understand is that we have a very large program right now. We've got a very strong marketing organization, and we have continued to underpin our LNG investment decisions, our final investment decisions with long-term contract structure that helps ensure the return expectations on those investments. And rest assured, we've got active marketing programs in place.", "Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP", "Right. And just a very quick follow-up is you mentioned I think some asset sale gains in the quarter that helped the results. Could you quantify what those were on an earnings basis?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Yes. On an earnings basis, Anish, in the second quarter, it was $68 million, and all of that was in the Downstream.", "Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP", "Many thanks.", "Operator", "We will now go to Theepan Jothilingam from Exane BNP Paribas.", "Theepan Jothilingam - Exane Ltd.", "Yes. Hi. Good morning, Jeff. Thanks for taking my questions. I've got just two actually, please. I think you discussed the broadening of the fuels marketing business in Mexico. But is there a broader strategy there for Exxon to invest more aggressively in fuels marketing, and where are those opportunities as you see them today?", "And then secondly, we've talked about the deepwater and Liza and Guyana. But I was just wondering whether you saw opportunities for Exxon in the bidding rounds coming up in Brazil. Thank you.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Well Theepan, thanks for the questions. On our fuels marketing, you may be aware that we had transitioned to a branded wholesale model, really with a focus of expanding our market share and brand, and at the same time reducing our capital and operational risk, and that's worked very well. We're seeing some really good pickup out there with these branded wholesale opportunities. And we see that as an important element of our value proposition going forward. Of course, in conjunction with that is that we're rolling out at the same time and expanding our signature line on Synergy gasoline and diesel fuels. So it's the whole package that's important in terms of our overall expansion of this branded wholesale model.", "On the second question about our interest in participating in Brazil, in short, no doubt about it, Theepan, Brazil has a very nice endowment, resource endowment, high quality, great geology. We need to see what's being offered in terms of the potential blocks as well as the participation structure, and that will guide us in terms to the level of interest that we will progress.", "And you think about it from a benchmark perspective, we're looking for things like Guyana with really high quality, really good, if you will, risk/reward structure on how we manage this portfolio going forward. We do have a bias towards wanting to operate these assets because we think through our long-established project management capabilities and our ability to continue to grow the value proposition, once we make the investment and all the way through the lifecycle of the asset, that we tend to get more out of it. So I'll leave it there, but you can get the sense that certainly very interested, it's just got to compete with the rest of the portfolio.", "Theepan Jothilingam - Exane Ltd.", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "We will now move to a question from Biraj Borkhataria of Royal Bank of Canada.", "Biraj Borkhataria - RBC Europe Ltd.", "Hi, Jeff. Thanks for taking my questions, I had a couple. The first one was on Guyana and back on Liza. Based on what you see now, would you be able to give us your blue-sky scenario for the resource base and how you think that can go over the next year or two?", "And then the second question on LNG relating to Mozambique, so you acquired 25% of the project. One of your peers has talked about the willingness to take on more than their equity interest as an offtake volume in order to enhance the portfolio. Is that something you would be interested in for that project? Thanks.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Yeah, on the first one, what I just summarized, other than what we've already communicated at this point, Biraj, around what we anticipate as a recoverable resource, as you can see from the display that we shared with you, there's a lot of potential plays there. They've got very material potential. It's really too early for us to go ahead and share what we think the ultimate resource potential is.", "You may recall that it was stated back at the analyst meeting that we clearly see multiple billion-barrel potential for the blocks. In fact, we're there today, but we're very encouraged. And I think the additional seismic acquisition, the analysis that we\\re doing, and the drilling that we're doing is going to help us converge on a look, on a view longer term. Can you tell me again the second question you had about what you're hearing from a competitor?", "Biraj Borkhataria - RBC Europe Ltd.", "So one of your peers has talked about their willingness to take on more than their share of the equity interest. So for example, you have of 25% interest in Mozambique. Would you be willing to take on say 50% of the offtake volumes?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Again, early days. We need to get into the venture structure here hopefully within the end of the year. and then we're always open to potential opportunities, again, as long as it competes with the portfolio that we've got right now. But I'm not going to speculate on market rumors or whatnot because I'm really not familiar with the specifics that you shared.", "Biraj Borkhataria - RBC Europe Ltd.", "Okay, thanks. That's very helpful.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will now take a question from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James.", "Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Thanks for taking the question, guys. First on PNG, many of your shareholders came into the stock based on their InterOil ownership. And for their benefit, I'm wondering if you can give an update on the resource certification of the Elk-Antelope field and the contingent value rights?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Yes, thanks for asking the question, Pavel. Certainly, I know there are many that are interested in how that closes out. As you know, we completed the Antelope well that we were drilling, and the resource certification process is in progress. The plan is that will be concluded in the third quarter, and then the final results will be shared as per the arrangement. So I'm hopeful that that will come to closure soon.", "Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay, very helpful, and then one more on Europe. You talked about the year-over-year decline in Groningen, but there is an additional further cap that you guys are currently appealing. If that appeal at the Dutch court fails, do you have any other options before you have to reduce production further?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "I think what you're referring to is that this minister went ahead and decided to further curtail production from 24 billion to 21.6 billion cubic meters per year. That doesn't go into effect until the next gas year, which starts in September. I really don't want to get into the discussions that we're having with the government. We certainly understand the issue. There has been a lot of really good collaboration amongst the various parties to make sure that we've got a good understanding, and that will all be addressed in these discussions between the various parties. I'm not going to speculate how that turns out.", "Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay, fair enough. I appreciate it.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "No problem.", "Operator", "We'll now go to John Herrlin of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.", "John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale", "Just two quick ones on Guyana, Jeff. Is Ranger a structural trap or a strat trap?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Good morning, John. Ranger, the carbon build, it would likely be structural.", "John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale", "Okay. I was just wondering if you had clastics off lapping on it. Next question, for Liza Phase 1, Hess mentioned that you're only planning eight producers. Is that correct? And should we assume for comparable phases that it will be a low number of wells given relative productivity or expected productivity?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Yes, as you heard, we had a really nice test on Liza, and that really sets us up for the development plan. So we do have eight production wells planned from four drill centers, and we'll see how that goes as the development progresses, but that is the current basis going forward.", "John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale", "Great, thank you.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Thank you, John.", "Operator", "And we'll now go to Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Doug, if you could, please check your mute function.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Sorry about that. Yes, indeed, sorry for lining up again, Jeff. I just wanted to close the loop on one issue. The deeper Payara tail, Hess gives some color on it, but I guess we're going to get the official version from you. Can you just give what your prognosis was there, whether there are plans to go to a Payara 3 and try that deeper section again, or are you done with that one and moving on? I'll leave it there, thank you.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "In terms of the plans, Doug, that's yet to be determined. But yes, we did deep in approximately 300 meters to evaluate a deeper exploration objective. And I'll just note before I share the results that this was a good low-cost opportunity to evaluate what we saw as potentially a material prospect.", "In terms of what we found, we found high-quality water-bearing sands that oil shows throughout. I think we would characterize the results as being encouraging, both from a reservoir quality and hydrocarbon systems standpoint in the deeper section, and that information will clearly be integrated into our forward assessment.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Jeff, do you find people bite to that at a future date with another Payara appraisal and maybe another deepening? Because it sounds like you're not \u2013 I'm trying to read the tea leaves here a little bit. Are you writing the deeper section off completely, or are you saying there's further testing you want to do in that Cenomanian part of the play?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "I think the results would indicate that clearly we need to integrate that into our overall model of the depositional environment and the potential, and that may lead up to some additional work in those sands of a comparable geologic age. But it's just way too early to comment on specific plans at this point.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "All right, I'll leave it there. Thank you for taking my follow-up.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "All right, Doug.", "Operator", "And we have time for one final question, and that will come from Guy Baber of Simmons.", "Guy Baber - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Good morning, Guy.", "Guy Baber - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Thanks for fitting me in here. I apologize for revisiting this, but I think it's important, and just trying to understand the messaging on the $25 billion or so medium-term capital spending framework and how sensitive that might be to the oil price environment should we find ourselves in a lower oil price world than you may have anticipated at the time you gave the guidance. And really, I'm just trying to understand that tension between investing sufficiently to sustain, replenish your portfolio, against the willingness to tolerate some cash flow outspend. And really, I just ask because on an organic basis, your spending right now is obviously well below that $25 billion future potential run rate, even allowing for some pretty material activity increases over the back half of this year.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "I think it's a very good question. A couple thoughts I would share with you is, one, remember our long-term investment program is really founded on our long-term constructive view of energy demand, and we are really trying. For us to compete and win, simply put, is that we have got to be the lowest cost of supply producer out there. And that's really the mindset that we use as we set up these long-cycle investments, okay? So a large part of our investment program that we shared with you all in March at the analyst meeting out through the end of the decade is really is long-cycle investments.", "Now of course we've got a short-cycle component, and it represents, let's just say round numbers, about a third of our total Upstream spend. And we will look at that, particularly in a near-term low-price environment. We'll look at that to make sure that it makes good sense because one of the things you want to do in the short-cycle program, particularly in things like Permian or the Bakken, is you want to maintain a certain level of activity to continue to grow that learning curve. You don't ever want to drop back on that learning curve.", "On the same hand, you don't want to over-invest. The last thing we want to do is over-capitalize in unconventional business. So we'll keep a level commensurate with that learning curve benefit. And you saw that over 2015 to 2016. As we dropped rigs, we stayed pretty high in our activity level. So those are some of the tradeoffs we've got.", "Let's summarize by saying that we've got flexibility. We have always built in flexibility and we tried to share some of that at the analyst meeting with respect to our capital program. But again, I'll just emphasize that the long-cycle program is really based on our constructive view of supply and demand.", "Guy Baber - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "And this does conclude our question and answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. Woodbury for any additional or closing comments.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "To conclude, I just thank everybody once again for your time, very thoughtful questions this morning, a really good exchange of some of the key fundamental elements that drives our value proposition. I do appreciate the preparation. And importantly, we really do appreciate the trust that our investors place in ExxonMobil. So we'll close here, and we look forward to our future discussions.

Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale", "Operator", "Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Exxon Mobil Corporation third quarter 2017 earnings call. Today's call is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations & Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings call.", "My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. Before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on slide 2.", "Turning now to slide 3, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our third quarter performance. ExxonMobil earned $4 billion in the quarter, bringing year-to-date earnings to $11.3 billion. Earnings rose 50% from the prior-year period, as commodity prices improved and business performance strengthened. All three business segments delivered solid results, generating cash flow from operations and asset sales that exceeded dividends and net investments for the fourth consecutive quarter.", "These results were achieved as the company worked to safely bring our Gulf Coast manufacturing operations back online following the devastating effects of Hurricane Harvey. In addition, we continued capturing attractive opportunities across the value chain from securing high-potential exploration acreage, to logistics investments, to expanding chemical capacity in growing markets. I'll highlight these items in more detail later.", "Moving to slide 4, we provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Overall, global economic growth was modest in the quarter. The Eurozone and Japan experienced slower economic expansion along with the U.S., which was negatively impacted by hurricanes. In China, economic expansion remained steady compared to the previous quarter. The commodity price environment was mixed, as crude oil prices increased, but natural gas prices were flat to down. Global rig count increased slightly, driven by higher activity in North America. Refining margins improved with stronger global distillate demand while global chemical commodity margins softened, driven by increases in feed and energy costs.", "Turning now to the financial results on slide 5. As indicated, ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings were $4 billion or $0.93 per share. In the quarter, the corporation distributed $3.3 billion in dividends to our shareholders. CapEx was $6 billion, reflecting increased activity and the completion of the Jurong Aromatics plant acquisition. As previously indicated, this facility provides added value to integration with our existing world-class petrochemical facilities in Singapore, which are well placed to meet growing regional demand. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $8.4 billion, more than $1 billion higher than the last quarter. Cash totaled $4.3 billion at the end of the quarter, and debt was $40.6 billion, down $1.3 billion from the prior quarter.", "Next slide provides additional detail on sources and uses of cash. So over the quarter, our cash balances increased from $4 billion to $4.3 billion. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program yielded $8.4 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Note, this includes a working capital build of approximately $1 billion related to Hurricane Harvey.", "Uses of cash included shareholder distributions of $3.3 billion and net investments in the business of $3.4 billion. Debt reduction and other financing items decreased cash by $1.4 billion. In the third quarter, ExxonMobil did not make any share repurchases to offset dilution related to our benefit plans and programs, and we don't currently plan on making additional purchases to reduce shares outstanding in the fourth quarter.", "Moving on to slide 7 for a review of our segment results. ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings increased $1.3 billion from a year-ago quarter, driven by stronger Upstream and Downstream results and lower corporate charges from favorable tax items. Although corporate and financing charges have been trending below our guidance range in recent quarters, we expect fourth quarter corporate charges to be toward the high end of the $400 million to $600 million guidance. I'll note that our corporate effective tax rate for the quarter was 33%, up from 20% a year ago, reflecting changes in our segment earnings mix and other one-time tax items.", "Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results starting on slide 8. Third quarter Upstream earnings were $1.6 billion, an increase of nearly $950 million from the prior-year quarter, driven by higher realizations. Crude prices rose nearly $6.50 per barrel versus the year-ago quarter, while the gas realizations increased about $0.60 per thousand cubic feet.", "Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $20 million. All other items increased earnings $70 million, driven by lower operating expenses, which were partly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Upstream unit profitability for the quarter was $4.53 per barrel excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes.", "Moving to slide 9, oil equivalent production in the quarter was 3.9 million barrels per day, an increase of nearly 2% compared to the third quarter of 2016. Liquids production was up 69,000 barrels per day. Favorable volume impacts from projects, work programs and reduced downtime were partly offset by field decline and lower entitlements. Natural gas production decreased 16 million cubic feet per day, as project and work program volumes were more than offset by fuel decline, lower demand and regulatory impacts in the Netherlands.", "Moving now to the Downstream financial and operating results on slide 10. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $1.5 billion, up $300 million compared to the third quarter of 2016. Stronger refining margins, primarily distillate and gasoline, increased earnings by $1 billion. Unfavorable volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $160 million, mainly due to lower throughput from Hurricane Harvey, partly offset by improved operations. All other items reduced earnings by $550 million, reflecting the absence of favorable asset management gains of $380 million related to the sale of Canadian retail assets in the third quarter of 2016, as well as expenses related to the hurricane.", "Now, moving to Chemical financial and operating results on slide 11. Third quarter Chemical earnings were $1.1 billion, down $79 million compared to the prior-year quarter. Weaker commodity margins, driven by increased feed and energy costs, decreased earnings by $200 million. Higher product sales, driven by increased demand, new capacity and improved operations, increased earnings by $120 million. All other items in the quarter included costs associated with Hurricane Harvey and expenses from new production units in Saudi Arabia and Singapore, offset in part by favorable foreign exchange effects.", "Moving now to slide 12 for an update on our hurricane recovery efforts, Hurricane Harvey had devastating impacts for many of our employees, contractors, and the communities in which we live and operate. Nonetheless, our highly dedicated people and effective operations integrity systems permitted a safe shutdown of our refining and chemical operations in Baytown, Mont Belvieu, and Beaumont.", "Because of advanced planning and preparation, we were able to protect the infrastructure of our manufacturing plants, and we're well positioned to resume operations in a timely fashion. Refining and chemical operations at these sites are now back to normal.", "Following the storm, we worked closely with our partners and customers who sell our branded products to maximize fuel supplies to consumers and emergency responders. We acted quickly to bring in gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel from other regions in the U.S. and abroad to supplement our production, ensuring the return of reliable supply to our customers.", "Our Upstream operations fortunately experienced limited impacts, with some offshore platforms temporarily shut in. Overall, Hurricane Harvey had an estimated unfavorable impact on third quarter earnings of $160 million and a debit of $0.04 per share.", "ExxonMobil employees continue to dedicate their time and resources to support the communities impacted by the storm, and we are proud of our employees who provided hands-on assistance with flood relief, and we continue to support them in their efforts.", "Moving to slide 13, we're making good progress on further strengthening our portfolio in South America with high-potential opportunities. First, in Guyana, we announced our fifth offshore discovery with the successful Turbot well. The well encountered 75 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs, and is located approximately 30 miles to the southeast of the Liza Phase 1 project. Evaluation of the discovery is underway. Importantly, this success proves a new play and helps to derisk multiple plays in the Turbot area. We plan to drill an additional well in the new year to help delineate this discovery. The rig is now moving to the Ranger prospect, which is another new play test on the Stabroek Block.", "In Brazil, we are pleased to have secured an attractive offshore acreage position, winning 10 blocks in the September bid round and completing a farm-in on two additional blocks. Each of these blocks is under a concession contract.", "In the highly prospective outer Campos pre-salt, ExxonMobil was jointly awarded six blocks with Petrobras. Each partner holds 50% working interest, with Petrobras as the operator. ExxonMobil was also awarded an additional two blocks in the Northern Campos Basin with 100% working interest.", "In the Sergipe-Alagoas Basin, ExxonMobil recently farmed in with Murphy on two blocks held by QGEP. We then jointly bid with this co-venture group, and we were awarded two additional blocks in the same basin. For all four of these blocks, ExxonMobil will operate and hold a 50% working interest.", "The 12 blocks combined offer promising deepwater exploration potential. The Campos Basin blocks are an extension of the pre-salt play where multiple world-class discoveries have been made. We have identified multibillion-barrel prospects on our own existing high-quality seismic data over these blocks and look forward to working with the government and our partners to progress exploration plans. We anticipate commencing exploration activities in 2018 with 3D seismic acquisition and then drilling in 2019.", "Turning now to slide 14 for an update on our efforts to further enhance business integration for our growing attractive resources in the Permian Basin to our Gulf Coast manufacturing hubs. As you know, we continue to expand our acreage position in the Permian using strategic trades and acquisitions. Since the Delaware acquisition in the first quarter of this year, ExxonMobil has executed another five acreage transactions, adding a combined total of 22,000 operated acres for an implied cost of about $20,000 per acre. This acreage is contiguous to our core positions, making it ideal for capital-efficient development using long lateral wells, and adds more than 400 million oil equivalent barrels of low-cost resources.", "We're also expanding logistics access and flexibility to capture value from wellhead to premium fuels and chemical products. Earlier this year, we completed the formation of the Permian Express Partners pipeline joint venture with Energy Transfer Partners. In addition, in July, we concluded an agreement with Summit Midstream Partners to create a new natural gas gathering and processing system, servicing production from our acreage.", "Earlier this month, we further enhanced our logistics capabilities with the acquisition of a crude oil terminal in Wink, Texas from Genesis Energy. This acquisition marks ExxonMobil's first terminal in the Permian Basin to be anchored by the company's recently acquired Delaware acreage.", "The terminal is strategically positioned to handle Permian crude oil and condensate for transport to Gulf Coast refineries and marine export terminals. The facility is interconnected to the Plains Alpha Crude Connector pipeline system and is permitted for 100,000 barrels per day of throughput, with the ability to expand. The terminal provides crude producers with a full range of logistical options, including truck, rail, and inbound and outbound pipeline access, establishing ExxonMobil as a key midstream provider in the rapidly growing Permian Basin.", "These logistics investments support ongoing manufacturing investments to increase feed processing flexibility and capacity for higher-value products in our Downstream and Chemical businesses. Our leading presence in the Permian, from equity production through to Gulf Coast refining and chemical capacity, positions us for world-class development across the value chain.", "Moving to slide 15, the graph on the right shows our progress to date compared to the unconventional liquids volumes forecast we provided at our Analyst Day in March. Our total unconventional production from the Delaware, Midland, and Bakken basins is now over 200,000 oil equivalent barrels per day.", "We are currently operating 20 rigs in the Permian and will continue to ramp up to approximately 30 operated rigs by year-end 2018. We are leveraging our contiguous acreage position to drill long-lateral wells, targeting industry-leading unit development costs. The wells drilled in the Midland this year average about 10,000 lateral feet, well above the industry average.", "We continue to work with our dedicated innovation and technology team to improve our efficiency. We told you last quarter about drilling our first 12,500-foot lateral well in the Delaware, and this well was just brought on production.", "By leveraging our learnings in the Bakken, where we recently fractured the first of several 3-mile laterals, we will start drilling our first 3-mile lateral in the Permian before year end. ExxonMobil's best-in-class operational expertise allows for more efficient drilling and completions, which in turn enables us to enhance value through our operated investments.", "We'll continue to incorporate learnings to lower unit costs as we grow our unconventional liquids at a 20% compounded annual growth rate through 2025, underpinned by near-term annual growth in the Permian at about 45%.", "Turning now to slide 16, the summary of the corporation's year-to-date sources and uses of cash highlights the solid performance of our business segments, which enables the company to meet its commitments to our shareholders. As shown, year-to-date 2017 cash flow from operations and asset sales of $24.4 billion funded shareholder distributions, net investments in the business, and a reduction in debt.", "In addition, we continue to generate free cash flow while selectively investing in the business and maintaining capital discipline. This quarter marks the fourth consecutive quarter where free cash flow has exceeded distributions to our shareholders since the significant drop in oil prices.", "Moving now to the final slide, I'll conclude today's presentation with a summary of our year-to-date performance. Simply put, we continue to remain focused on long-term value growth. Our integrated business has grown cash flow from operations and asset sales to over $20 billion, an increase of over 40% compared to the first nine months of 2016.", "Our business segments have collectively earned over $11 billion, an increase of over $5 billion compared to the first nine months last year. Upstream production volumes are within our guidance range at 4 million oil equivalent barrels per day.", "We continue investing in and capturing new high-quality opportunities across the value chain, but remain disciplined in capital allocation while delivering best-in-class execution. This has resulted in total capital expenditures year-to-date of $14.1 billion.", "Finally, our year-to-date free cash flow of $13.5 billion more than covered our reliable and growing shareholder distributions of $9.7 billion. In short, we remain confident that our integrated business is well positioned to continue delivering long-term value for our shareholders.", "That concludes my prepared remarks, and we'll now open it up to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Woodbury. And we will first go to Doug Leggate from Bank of America.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Good morning, Doug.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And, Jeff, the capital expenditure year-to-date continues to look quite right relative to your guidance. So I wonder if you could just speak to if whether you really expect a catch-up at the back-end of the year and also maybe the $25 billion indication you gave for 2018. I guess what's at the back of my mind is that the Permian is a very low-cost offset to whatever you think the portfolio decline is. And it seems to us your CapEx flexibility is a lot better than perhaps your guidance suggests?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Doug, as you said, our year-to-date expenditures on CapEx is trending lower at this point, but we still have our guidance at $22 billion. You may recall that our objective is to go ahead and close the transaction for the Mozambique Area 4 acreage before year end, and that's still the plan, and that was about $2.8 billion. At the same time, we have also ramped up some activity in our unconventional business. And, of course, we've got the Brazil transactions that we just consummated. And all of that really leads us to the view that the guidance is appropriate.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "To be honest, I didn't \u2013 go on, go on, I'm sorry.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Looking forward into 2018 and thereafter, of course, we'll go ahead and provide an update before 2018 gets there. But our plan is still \u2013 and I wouldn't assume that our CapEx is linear over that timeframe. And I think we showed $70 billion to $80 billion over 2018 to 2020. But it is going to be in the general ballpark of about $25 billion plus or minus. But like I said, we'll go ahead and provide an update here early next year.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So I didn't mean to interrupt you, Jeff. But just to be clear, first of all, I didn't realize that Mozambique had not yet closed, so that explains it perhaps. But the $25 billion number next year also include acquisitions?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Well, Doug, we tend to leave a little flexibility in the budget to pursue opportunities that come up. But we'll give you \u2013 if there's something that we believe is fairly close and certain, we typically would include it. But if it's not at a point where we believe it's going to close, we typically do not.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thank you. My follow-up is \u2013 I'm not going to be too predictable here, but is Guyana, your comments on Turbot. I guess my understanding is the rig stayed on location several weeks after you disclosed the result. One wouldn't expect you to do that on a small discovery. So I wondered if you could speak to what you're thinking in terms scale of the greater Turbot area. And maybe an update on how you're thinking about the coincident timing of multiple phases in Liza, Payara? And I'll leave it there. Thank you.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Yeah, sure. Well, again, as you would expect that we are very pleased with the Turbot discovery. We do plan \u2013 as I may have indicated previously, we do a plan going back and drill a follow-up well in 2018. The important message on Turbot is that it did confirm a new play, different depositional environment, and there's still a lot of work to be done. It's early days in order to assess it, but there were a number of follow-up plays in this area that allows us to go ahead and better define and potentially go ahead and assess.", "As you go forward, to your second question about the subsequent developments, what I would tell you is that obviously, we're very encouraged by the results in Guyana. We had previously given you a range of about 2.3 million to 2.8 million barrels of recoverable resource. Obviously, the Turbot results puts us towards the higher end of that. And we will certainly, as we better define Turbot, we will certainly refine our resource range. But given those results, we have had active development planning for subsequent phases and progress. I would say given the significant exploration success to date that we are considering at least two more phases, Phase 2 and Phase 3, for Guyana. And we are also considering higher processing capacity for the ships. Now, of course, as we continue our parallel exploration program, that will be integrated into our development planning efforts, and things may change. But very positive progress and certainly a very important component of our portfolio going forward.", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, Jeff, I'll leave it there. But I just wondered if you would give us some idea as to when you would expect to FID the subsequent phases. And I'll really leave it there. Sorry for the extended question.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "I really don't have \u2013 I certainly appreciate the interest, Doug, and I really don't have a timeline at this point. We're looking at all the various options, but given the progress we made, I mean, you can appreciate with the Phase 1 development, that was a best-in-class five year from discovery to startup, and the extent that we can continue to capture the, if you will, Design One Build Many concept, we want to keep on a fairly good pace going forward. Okay?", "Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Operator", "And we'll now go to Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI.", "Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Good morning, Doug.", "Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC", "Around this time of the year, companies often reassess strategy and pay incentives to reflect changes in competitive and corporate governance environments. And on this point, ExxonMobil has historically emphasized returns on capital employed and free cash flow and shareholder distributions, and these metrics have very strong correlations to total shareholder return, which is obviously a good thing, especially in relation to some of the growth metrics.", "Simultaneously, ExxonMobil's stock is flat versus a decade ago and relative performance versus energy peers is mixed. And so that begs the question whether a change in the mix or weightings of incentives is needed or whether a more challenging peer group, which might include S&P 500, as a peer has done, might be beneficial to shareholders, too. So can you comment, Jeff, on how the company thinks about these issues given the performance of the stock over the past decade? And how important this topic is internally in the grand scheme of things?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Doug, as we've talked in the past, I'll just reinforce to the broader group that it is very important. And the fundamental principle for our executive compensation structure is to tie a large component of the compensation to the same performance that our shareholders will experience.", "So we have one of, if not the longest, incentive programs in terms of vesting. And the -again, the \u2013 that whole ultimate compensation is driven by how the stock will ultimately do. As you know, we are in a business that has very long cycle times on returns because of the magnitude of the investment. And we want to make sure that we hold our executives to the decisions that they made over a long period of time. So we have a very large part of the compensation that is performance-based, that is tied directly to the share's performance. As you said, there are other parameters that the board considers, and return on capital employed and safety performance are two of the seven key criteria.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Yeah. No, you definitely seem to be using the right metric, so I just wonder if the weightings could be reset or what have you. But anyway, so \u2013 I also have one other question, Jeff. You guys announced a pretty meaningful asset sale, if I read this correctly. Can you talk about how it affected the published earnings number of $0.93 per share in the quarter?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "The \u2013 you mean the overall asset proceeds of...", "Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC", "Yes. Yes. Was there any gains and losses we should know about that were meaningful?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Yeah. So, overall, from an earnings impact, it was actually a quarter-on-quarter decrease.", "Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC", "Okay.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "A quarter-to-quarter decrease on earnings by about 300 \u2013 just over $300 million.", "Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC", "Okay.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "On the overall proceeds, in the release, it was about $850 million. And a lot of that in the third quarter was really associated with the receivable that we had due in Papua New Guinea.", "Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC", "Okay, absolutely.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Okay?", "Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC", "Okay, Jeff. Thanks a lot.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "All right. Thank you, Doug.", "Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Good morning.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Maybe another strategic question to start. Peak oil demand driven by (32:59) penetration has increasingly captivated investor attention, and it does represent a medium to longer-term challenge. I know that you expect on your macro work to see demand growth for decades yet. Has the risk of peak oil demand altered in any way, or how is that considered in your gating process for both Upstream and Downstream projects, especially given the depth in your portfolio?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Evan, this is a very important question and one that probably can take a lot of time to describe. But for us, it really starts with the annual update of our energy outlook. That is fundamental to providing us the insights around our business strategy and our investment planning. If I very quickly summarize that oil demand is primarily driven by three components: light-duty vehicle consumption, heavy-duty consumption and petrochemicals. And what's really driving that growth are the latter two: petrochemicals and heavy-duty consumption.", "Right now, there's not a sufficient alternative to replace those energy sources because of the energy intensity requirements. Now our energy outlook assumes on light-duty vehicles that we will reach a peak in gasoline demand and come down, and that's driven by two things. It's driven by efficiency of ICE, of internal combustion engines, as well as greater hybrid and EV penetration into the marketplace. So the bottom result of all this is, is that we do look at variations in the peak or in the EV penetration. And if you look at our forecast right now, we have by 2040 the fleet is about 6% EV. If you were to increase that by 50%, that would have a liquids demand impact of about 0.5 million barrels per day.", "So not substantial when you think about overall oil demand of over 100 million barrels per day at that point, but certainly, something that we keep a very close look at as we think about our research and development activities, as well as building the strategy. And then a key element of what we have been doing in this area is, and you've heard us talk about it, is how we are making strategic investments today in order to upgrade those gasoline molecules into higher-value products, like distillates and lubricants.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Appreciate the color. Second one on the U.S. onshore bases. Exxon is one of the fastest accelerators here, growth you've gone from 16 to 25 rigs and four in the Permian just since mid-year, and your plan is here to add another 10 by 2018. I guess, particularly as it relates to the Permian, are you seeing any deterioration in equipment or completion crew quality that is being highlighted by some smaller operators? And are you able to fully mitigate or offset some of those pressures given your global sourcing advantage?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Yeah. No, that's a good question because any time you come off a very low cycle like we've just been through, you have to be very mindful of the crew qualifications and the equipment capability. But remember, Evan, that even in that low cycle, we maintained a fairly active rig program in the onshore U.S., and that is because we want to maintain that learning curve benefit and we want to make sure that we are taking full advantage of the market at that point.", "So therefore, as we ramp up, we've got a very strong fleet of service providers. As we add additional rigs, clearly, the partnership that we've got with our service providers, they understand what the minimum standards are because what you want to avoid is all that rework associated with execution, shortfalls in quality \u2013 shortfalls in quality performance.", "But we have not \u2013 there is nothing material that I would point to at this stage, but it's something that you've got to watch very carefully as you go into a ramp-up phase, especially in areas where there's a lot of activity.", "Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Makes sense. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll now go to Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.", "Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yeah. Hi, good morning, Jeff. Just first question, I just want to clarify the comment on the asset sale gains in earnings. You mentioned that quarter-over-quarter, but could you give us the absolute number? I know Downstream \u2013 we didn't have the gains from last quarter, but what was the absolute Upstream gain?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "And you're asking for in the quarter or quarter-on-quarter?", "Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "In the quarter on an absolute basis.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "The absolute gain was almost $80 million in the quarter, and most of that was in the Upstream.", "Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Got it. Thank you. Second question is on the CapEx that was asked about before looking towards the longer term. You were talking about $25 billion plus or minus in a given year. And I think when I asked about this last quarter, you did seem to suggest maybe it'd be a bit more of a linear path lower and then kind of ramping in the out years. Is that still how you think about it, or will 2018 be more in that $25 billion plus or minus?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Yeah. Phil, I think it's probably best to wait until we get to the next phase of communication around our forward investment plans. I mean, it's going to be in the \u2013 where we are in 2017 to around that ballpark. But as you know, we picked up a number of very attractive new assets that we're going to get after right away. And that needs to be integrated into our forward investment plans.", "Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Got it. And then you made a comment that you will not be doing buybacks to offset dilution. I think in the third quarter \u2013 I mean, it tends to be lumpy it appears, maybe if you can just comment on that and the decision not to do that.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Yeah. So there's two components. One is the purchase of shares to offset dilution for our benefits plans and programs, and that is lumpy. That happens usually I believe in the first quarter timeframe. The second component of that is our buyback program. And as we've talked previously in capital allocation, the way we think about it from our sources of funds, the first things that are being funded are our dividends and our investment program. And if there's any cash left at that point given that the corporation does not want to hold large cash reserves, it's at that point that we will look for what the next best thing is.", "And maybe if we have some debt maturing, we'll pay that debt down. But on a quarterly basis, we'll make a decision on whether we go ahead and buy back some shares. And I'll say, Phil, that decision is a function of number of factors. One being the current financial position of the corporation, as I said, both our CapEx and dividend requirements, as well as what we see in the near term in terms of the business outlook, but it's a decision that ultimately is made on a quarterly basis.", "Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. I will leave it there. Thanks.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll now go to Roger Read from Wells Fargo.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Good morning, Roger.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "If we could come back to the Permian, the comment about 10,000-foot average laterals now going to 12,500 or at 12,500 and then the idea of 15,000, can you give us an idea of maybe what you've done pilot-wise to this point that gives you confidence that's the right direction to go just because as you go longer laterals, more things can go wrong, and since you do have the acreage, maybe an idea of the performance you're seeing out of those longer wells relative to, say, 10,000 or less?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "It's a good question, and you're really honing in on a key element of our overall strategy. I'll start with it's probably becoming much clearer to the group what the value chain strategy that we've put in place for the Permian. We've built up a very large contiguous acreage position that really allows us to leverage the strength of our technology capability. For us, I'll be real clear. It's not about just how we execute. It's all about how do we extend best-in-class performance. Clearly, what we're trying to do is leverage our full technological capability to go ahead and achieve the lowest unit cost and then capturing the highest value from the barrels through the full value chain, ultimately to the customer. Okay?", "So what have we done is we have recently drilled several wells in the Bakken on 3-mile laterals. The first one has been completed now. These are very long wells. We want to make sure that we get good inflow performance across the full lateral length. We drilled the first well in Delaware at 12,500 feet, and that well is just coming on right now. And we're getting ready to drill a 3-mile lateral in the Permian as well. And we've got a very focused research effort on this from the reservoir all the way to the hardware, and we're really looking at how do we make a step change in the ultimate development here.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay, great. Thanks. And then just as a follow-up, back to the earlier question on CapEx, if we make the adjustment for the \u2013 let's just assume the Permian acreage was the big change Q2 to Q3, it implies that your overall CapEx was fairly stable Q2 to Q3. And then you have the Mozambique in front of you. Is there any other \u2013 other than the comments about higher drilling in the Lower 48, anything else that we should think about that steps up as we go into year end the first part of 2018?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Let me just correct you. On the increase in the third quarter, that was primarily driven by closing the acquisition for Jurong Aromatics. Okay?", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "I'm sorry. I was talking Upstream CapEx only.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Oh. Okay.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "So $2.8 billion went to roughly $3.2 billion, and the math works out that that's the Permian. Obviously, you've got plenty of things moving around, but I was just trying to understand. If that is the case, then the step-up, even if we adjust for Mozambique, still has to be fairly significant in the latter part of this year. And then I was just wondering what else was going on as we walk our way into 2018 other than an increase in Lower 48 activity?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Probably the biggest piece is the increase in the Lower 48 drilling, predominantly in the unconventional. I'll just remind you, we also have four major projects underway that a couple of them are getting close to a startup stage, so it's primarily project spending, it's the ramp-up on unconventional, and then our base work program in the Upstream.", "Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll now go to Sam Margolin from Cowen & Company.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hey, good morning.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Good morning, Sam.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "I'd like to get your assessment of the LNG market right now, considering it ties back to a couple of the acquisitions you made over the past year-plus. And you did mention that some of the capital ramp is going into those new assets.", "The market has been really quiet over the course of all of 2017, not a lot of new FID activity or reports of buyers really looking to accelerate commitments. And I wonder how much of that is due to the wall of supply that's coming on between now and 2018? And if you think that can pick up as the second half of next year emerges, or if this quiet period might last a little bit longer and how that might affect some of your timing around those new big global gas assets you have?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Sam, again, I'd start with our energy outlook, where we've got gas growing from 2015 to 2040 at about 1.5% per year. And a pretty sizable component is our LNG business, and that's growing probably about 2.5 times over that timeframe.", "Now, just like any type of commodity, we're going to have periods of oversupply and periods where there will be insufficient supply. And I think everybody's well aware there's a number of projects that have come on that are ramping up. Others will be starting up, and that's likely to provide a period where we'll have oversupply to, say, the mid-2020s. But as we think about the very large, very diverse portfolio we have that potentially could be LNG projects, we're moving all of them forward at the pace consistent with where the project is in its maturation timeline.", "And the objective is to move all of them into a final investment decision. But we recognize they're not all going to go at that same pace. The key here, the very important message here is, we've got to be on the far left side of the cost of supply curve. We have got to be the most cost competitive out there in the market in order to attract that demand growth that I was talking about.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. And I guess \u2013 so the follow-up then, I guess, because this hasn't been apparent, by the way. The market has progressed over the past year or so. Do you think that there will be opportunities for you to get commitments from buyers at the scale that you might need to FID some of these project, even if the market at that time is oversupplied? Are you seeing from your customers a look out into that post-2022 timeframe when the market is more balanced and they can sign up commitments out in the future, or do they need to see more near-term evidence of tightness before they move?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "I think it's a mix of both. I think the buyers are looking far out. Obviously, they need that supply. They need to make sure that they are well positioned from their standpoint to competitively capture that supply. I would just remind everybody that we have underpinned our past LNG project funding decisions with long-term firm contracts. And we all know that the market continues to evolve, adding more flexibility in commercial terms on shorter durations.", "So while our objective remains to secure commercial certainty to underpin these large funding decisions, it's more likely that projects in the near future were based on a hybrid of sales, although that doesn't diminish our interest in locking in long-term firm contracts.", "Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC", "All right, thank you so much.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Thanks, Sam.", "Operator", "And we'll now go to Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hi, Jeff. There's a little bit more Permian disclosure that's being referenced. When I look at the data that you've given here, you added 22,000 operated acres, more than 400 million oil equivalent barrels. So would I be mistaken in assuming that you spent about $400 million in the quarter based on the statement that you paid about $1 an oil equivalent barrel? And would I be even more mistaken if I said that that was about $18,000 an acre, or is that pretty much inferenced?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "That's an implied cost. And the reason I say that, Paul, is because the five transactions we're talking about were both cash and trades. So there were a number of non-cash trades that were in there as well.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay, all right. That's fine. And then it's interesting that you're talking about these much longer laterals, the 10,000 feet. And then you're saying that you're going to be drilling a 3-mile lateral in the Permian, but you've actually just completed one in the Bakken. I think that's what I heard, correct?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "That's right. We actually drilled \u2013 I think it's four in the Bakken, and we've completed the first one.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Great, thank you. And then if I look at the slide, and this is obviously slide 15, the implication of the very impressive growth forecast that you have is that you have all the acreage you need more or less to achieve the very aggressive volume growth that you're going for insofar as you identify the acreage that's going to provide that. Again, is that too much inference, or is that a fair sort of...", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "No, Paul, that's a good clarification. The volume that we have on slide 15 is really based on existing acreage that we have. Now, as I said in my prepared comments, one of the things that we're doing in a lot of our transactions is a build on \u2013 they bolt on to existing acreage that we have. So directionally, I can share that one of the strategies is to continue to grow that contiguous acreage.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Got it. Okay, that's helpful. Thanks a lot. And then Jurong was reported in the press to be a $1.7 billion sale. I think that's public information. Is that about the number? I'm trying to get obviously to the clean underlying CapEx.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Paul, unfortunately, we're bound by a confidentiality agreement on that with the sellers.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Understood, Jeff. And then the last one for me was that you did mention that you've been trending lower in corporate and other expenses, but there will be a bounce in Q4. I just wondered what that was about. It's bit of an arcane question for you, but thanks.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "As you know, corporate finance costs have a lot of variables in them. But I would say that probably the largest part of it, Paul, will be the absence of some of the favorable items that we're seeing in this quarter.", "Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC", "Fair enough, thank you.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Thank you, Paul.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks. Jeff, maybe just a couple quick ones. In the Permian disclosure that you have there, you talk about the planned increase from 20 Permian rigs to 30 by year-end 2018. Is the assumed pace of activity growth the same as what was implied in the 2017 Analyst Day earlier this year?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "I would tell you that it's picking up a bit. And I will just \u2013 just make sure I want to clarify for everybody that these are operated rigs. This does not include non-operated rigs that we participated in. But the volumes itself is our total net production. The \u2013 but the rig counts \u2013 I mean, it's comparable to what we had originally planned when we detailed out the basis for the acquisition, and that's what we shared with you in the March Analyst.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "And how do you think \u2013 when you look at over that multi-year period, how much does commodity price figure into that? I mean, you tend to kind of \u2013 I know you are executing the long-term plan, which is based on value creation. But as you think about potential upside and downside risk to that plan going forward, how much does the commodity figure in versus if you think of things like efficiency gains and cost inflation or inflation?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Certainly it's a factor, but we're working on both sides of that equation. We're not only working on the realization being mindful of it as we do the economics, but we're also working on the overall capital invested and operating costs driving that cost basis down.", "And you may recall in an earlier call, we provided a snapshot \u2013 I think it was in the Analyst Meeting, a snapshot of the economic resiliency of the existing portfolio. And at $40 flat rail, which is a reasonable lower end here, we had over 5,500 wells in the Permian and the Bakken that generated at least a 10% rate of return. And a large part of them \u2013 let's say about a third of them generated actually better than a 30% rate of return. So very good economic resiliency, but don't think of that as being static because we continue to work on dropping that cost. And you remember, last quarter I was sharing with you all that while our average unit development cost is $7 per oil equivalent barrel, we are trying to push that down further to \u2013 as far down as $5 per barrel.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "That's great. Thanks. And then maybe just one on Brazil. I appreciate the disclosure you have in the slides on Brazil. Can you maybe talk a little bit about your thoughts on the acreages that you've acquired, and how it would compare possibly to the upcoming pre-salt round, which I think is going on today in blocks, which I think you're potentially involved in? And then maybe what are your requirements from a drilling and seismic point of view over the next few years and how it more broadly fits into your global exploration portfolio?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "As you probably pick up from my prepared comments, we're very excited about the acreage position that we have. In fact, the bid round that's going on right now, I guess it's been announced now that ExxonMobil won the high bid on North Carcara as well. So this has really allowed us to get into a very prolific basin that we've been looking at for some time. You're all very much aware that this is all about value for us, and we've been very mindful of making sure that while it's got a very strong resource endowment, we needed to do it on the terms that it was competitive with our existing inventory, and we're very pleased with that.", "So, obviously, when you think about how we high-grade the portfolio, it's all about through our acquisitions and our exploration program, bringing in resources that go to the very top of the portfolio and then through our divestment program, monetizing the resources at the very bottom. And our full intent, as I said in my prepared comments, to get right after the Brazil acreage, we've got some really strong partners that we'll be working with. Well, we've already got some seismic \u2013 as I said in the prepared comments that we have some good sense of what's out there we're going to get right out to in 2018 3D seismic and then shortly thereafter, drilling. So very pleased with where we are. The potential that we've got and yet another high-quality deepwater resource that we'll bring our expertise to.", "Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Perfect. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Alastair Syme from Citi.", "Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.", "Good morning, Jeff. It's a topic that you mentioned, the Brazil award that has just been announced. I'm going to guess Exxon shifted a lot of the deepwater focus in recent years from West Africa to South America. Do you think the focus on the other side of the Atlantic margin is geological based or regulatory or really a combination of both?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Well, I mean, we keep a very broad brief of where there is high-value potential in the various basins. And really when you think about how we have structured our exploration program, it's primarily focusing in two areas. One being a focused exploration program on high-quality resources where we have existing operations that we can quickly leverage to get those discoveries on production in a very fast timeframe. And then the second area is new big, high-value potential that's play-opening. In Brazil, very strong geology, the government has evolved the fiscal basis and it's got good fiscal \u2013 competitive fiscal terms. So that's where \u2013 how we are focusing it on \u2013 on the exploration program.", "Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.", "My follow-up, Jeff, on the offshore is we're seeing a lot of deflation, and some of the recently awarded rig contracts have been getting pretty low. Are we at the stage yet that ExxonMobil is getting concerned about the financial viability of the supply chain that you see? And if so, what are you trying to do about it?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Well, I think you do address an issue that this industry has had to deal with over the cycles. When you get into low period, as I referenced earlier, the service sector starts getting down to their cost structure and we have got to find \u2013 continue to find those win-win solutions that allow the producer to achieve an attractive return, and at the same time keep the service sector healthy.", "One of the areas that I think ExxonMobil contributes is, we develop very long effective relationships with our supplier sector. And they fully understand that \u2013 the amount of activity that we can provide is a function of the value they add to the investment decisions.", "They have a tremendous amount of capability and innovative concepts that they have brought to collaborate with us in terms of providing new solutions for some of the more challenging resources. And I think we have a mutual objective here, and I think most of the service sectors understand that as well.", "Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Thanks, Alastair.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, Jeff. Good morning.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Good morning, Paul.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Simple really quick clarification. Earlier in your presentation when you were looking at the Permian expected growth, say, up to 500,000 \u2013 600,000-barrel per day production by year 2025, is that based on the rig program at 30 by the end of next year and then steady, or whether that's based on a continuing incremental growth in the rig program?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "It's really the latter. We would see some further growth in the rig program.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "And at this point, that is too early for you to comment on what is the growth rate of the rigs that you may have in mind?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "No, and really it's an interesting question because remember, these rigs are getting much, much more productive and how we drill these wells are getting much \u2013 much more efficient. I mean, I would expect over this timeframe that we will see much greater efficiency as we continue to progress this development as we have historically.", "I mean, if you look the rig counts right now in the Lower 48, while they're down more than 50%, that's not an equivalent reduction in overall activity because these rigs are much, much more productive today than they were back at the peak periods.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Sure. Second question, that in the press release and you also mentioned the half year impact is $160 million. Just want to clarify, is that represent only the cost associated for the repair or this is also include the lost opportunity costs?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Yeah. It includes two components. It includes the expenses as well as the lost volume. So that $160 million as we had in the press release and as I talked about previously equates to about a $0.04 per share hit.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "And on Turbot, the mix \u2013 where are you going to drill next year, is that a place or to the Turbot discovery itself, or are you just going to test on the good (01:04:12) Turbot area other structures?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "It will \u2013 on the existing resource, it will be a delineation of the existing resource, there's some \u2013 anytime you drill \u2013 remember this is a large area with a very small wellbore that's gone through it. These are generally stratigraphic traps. And it's about making sure that we test these multiple traps that we've seen in these accumulations. So it's going to have several objectives as we go forward. And then, of course, there in the general Turbot area, there are several other prospects that given now we have now proven the play, we need to go ahead and integrate those learnings into our forward rig schedule.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. And final one. The 22,000 net acre, the five transaction that you did, you mentioned there's about $20,000, so that's roughly about $440 million. So should we assume that the increase in \u2013 from the second to third quarter in the U. S. CapEx is all related to this because I mean if you back out $440 million, it actually \u2013 well, it means that CapEx in U.S. actually slightly down sequentially?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "No, actually that's not the case, Paul, because as I responded to Paul Sankey earlier, that is a combination of both cash as well as trades that we made.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "I see, okay.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Because there were some non-cash transactions there.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "But you still have a net increase of 22,000, right, or that the 22,000 is the final transaction, which is not a net increase?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "That's a net increase of 22,000 in the Permian.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Right. So it is a net increase even now that you have the trade, you're still \u2013 no, but that's fine. We can get you off-line. Thank you.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Yeah. Don't think that the trade is \u2013 involved is just Permian assets.", "Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Understand, thank you.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Okay.", "Operator", "And we'll now move to Blake Fernandez from Scotia Howard Weil.", "Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.", "Hey, Jeff. Good morning. It's late in the hour, so I'll just keep it to one question. I wanted to just shift gears a bit to our European gas, last quarter that came off pretty dramatically and it looks like it's remained depressed. I don't know if you could just help us kind of ways to think about modeling that going forward. I know seasonally you would typically have an uptick into 4Q, but any thoughts on that potentially returning at some point to next year or so?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Yeah, there really are two components on the European gas. Obviously, as you already pointed out, seasonal demand impacts which would turn around in the fourth quarter or start to turnaround in the fourth quarter. And then the second, it was about \u2013 I'm thinking it was about a 90 million cubic feet a day impact associated with the regulatory cap on the Netherlands, as well I think, Blake, there was some downtime in the UK.", "Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.", "And just so I'm clear on that 90 million a day, is there any outlook on that potentially changing into the future? Or should we just view that as pretty much out of the volume mix going forward?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Well, we are in \u2013 or NAM is in active discussion with the government. I really can't speculate on how that will play itself out over time.", "Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.", "Understood. Thank you.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Okay.", "Operator", "And we'll now go to Jason Gammel from Jefferies.", "Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.", "Well, thanks. I just wanted to come back to the point that you're making about enhancing Permian across the integrated value chain. Obviously, you've been building a big Upstream position and already have the Downstream position on the Gulf Coast. Can you talk about appetite for owning midstream assets? And I guess to put them in the context of the terminal acquisition at Wink. What would you consider strategic that you would want to own with obviously your low cost of capital, and what are you willing to contract out?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Jason, thanks for highlighting that because that's really the key message that we wanted to convey as it relates to our Permian. It's just not a pure Permian play, it's the full value chain from resource all the way to molecules to the customers, whether it would be refined products or chemical products.", "And as you heard in my prepared comments, one of the things that we're looking and we continue to look at is, where is the value leakage across that value chain, and do we add value in that? And if we do, that's what will play into our strategy and how we capture incremental assets along that value chain.", "On the Permian, we've got a very strong Gulf Coast manufacturing facilities. We have a very strong Permian resource position, we pick up these flexibility in a logistic system through the pipeline transactions that we've made. We've now got this oil terminal. It gives us control and value capture. We will continue \u2013 like we do in all of our assets, by the way, we'll continue to look at how can you further strengthen that value chain proposition that we or our shareholders are capturing a majority of the value there.", "Now, there may be some things along that value chain that we just don't add value to, and we're okay with someone else providing that missing piece in the value chain and getting value for it. But I think you get a better line of sight of what we're doing in terms of our value chain management.", "Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.", "Okay, thanks a lot, Jeff. And just the second one, if I could, please. Now that the Jurong transaction has been completed, can you give us some idea of how to think about the incremental profitability from the Chemical business? And I know we've got the PX volume and we can take that times margin, but can you just talk about some of the synergistic benefits that you get from that transaction when you combine it with your existing Singapore assets?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "I think probably the best guidance we've got from me for a quantification is what you just said in terms of the additional aromatics that we are picking up from it. And remember, there's still about \u2013 it's about 65,000 barrels a day of fuel coming from that facility as well. But, of course, the value proposition for us was not only the added value we will get from what the market currently values the asset from because of the unique contributions we think we bring to it, but also the synergies between the Jurong Aromatics site and our big Singapore manufacturing facilities. Probably the biggest part of that is logistics, leveraging the logistics capability of that site for the full integrated site, but we have not put numbers out there externally on that.", "Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.", "Okay. I guess I'll just make some guesses then. Thanks, Jeff.", "Operator", "Biraj Borkhataria from RBC Capital Markets has our next question.", "Biraj Borkhataria - RBC Capital Markets", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. I had two. First one is on Mozambique, could you just talk through the steps from now until closing and any significant things you need to close it by year-end, and if there's any risk to that slipping into 2018?", "And the second one is just on the Carcara acquisition that was announced just now. In the press release, from one of your peers, there were some contingent payments. I was wondering if you could just detail whether these are just related to the oil price or anything else that you can highlight. Thank you.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Okay. On the first one, on Mozambique, I mean, it's really simple in that we need to get a number of approvals and we are still waiting for those approvals. As to the possibility that it's spilling into 2018, there's always a possibility. But our objective right now, Biraj, is to go ahead and conclude this, this year.", "On Carcara, I'm not sure I know what you're really referring to. I'm going to have to punt on this one because I'm not sure what you're referring to.", "Biraj Borkhataria - RBC Capital Markets", "Just the press release from Statoil says they'll get $800 million from you guys and then a contingent payment of $500 million. So I was wondering what that $500 million was contingent on.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Okay. Yeah. Biraj, I don't \u2013 we're bound under the confidentiality agreement. I really can't talk about the commercial terms.", "Biraj Borkhataria - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. No worries. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Theepan Jothilingam from Exane BNP has our next question.", "Theepan Jothilingam - Exane BNP Paribas", "Good morning, Jeff, just a couple of questions. Firstly, you have been very active in the asset market in Mozambique and Brazil. I was just wondering how you see some of the potential offset by being a bit more active on the disposal side, particularly given some firming of prices there? That's my first question, actually. Thank you.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Theepan, a key element of our asset management program, as I said earlier, is to go ahead and monetize those assets on the bottom of the portfolio, importantly where others see value that is incremental above what we expect that we can capture from the continuing operation. We are always considering whether we can go ahead and complete that type of a transaction. So if you look at, for instance, the last five years, our total proceeds from asset sales were over $20 billion.", "So as I've said before, anywhere from $2 billion to $4 billion a year, we've historically went ahead and sold. But it is very focused on making sure that we're getting the most value from each one of our assets. And if we get the right value proposition, we'll go ahead and pursue it. But it is a key element of our ongoing asset management to the various business lines.", "Theepan Jothilingam - Exane BNP Paribas", "Great. And then the second question I had was \u2013 and I come back to the recent asset transactions, and you talk very much about having control in the Permian. I'm interested in terms of the moves both in Brazil and Mozambique to a certain degree where you've got less control. Is that a trend that we can expect more of outside U.S. onshore that you're prepared to take more non-operated positions?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "I would say fundamentally, if we can operate, we feel like we've got the greatest value proposition to bring. But that doesn't make that an exclusive criterion. If we think that there is a good value proposition and the co-venture \u2013 the structure of the co-venture is certainly very much willing to go ahead and allow us to contribute to the maximum extent, that's what we're going to try to go ahead and set up. But the key here is the value capture proposition and the operatorship, and the qualifications of those operators and our ability to make sure that we can influence the outcomes is all incorporated in that value proposition.", "Theepan Jothilingam - Exane BNP Paribas", "Okay, all right. Thanks, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Thanks, Theepan.", "Operator", "And we'll go to Brendan Warn from BMO Capital Markets.", "Brendan Warn - BMO Capital Markets Ltd.", "Thanks, Jeff. I'll keep this to one question considering the timing. Just on Baytown, you've obviously reiterated you haven't had too much in terms of production impacts because of Harvey. But can you just give us an update on the steam cracker and the development project there in terms of just impacts, delays, and are there any carryover to 2018, and just if there's going to be a slower ramp-up to 2020 impacts?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "So just to recap, the whole project included a new steam cracker at Baytown for 1.5 million tons per annum. And then currently, we've invested in Mont Belvieu for the derivative units two 650,000-ton metallocene polyethylene trains. On the latter part, the first train has started up and the second train is starting up now. So we have started generating a revenue stream for that project.", "On the steam cracker, the site was temporarily shut down due to the hurricane, but the construction activities resumed once all of our assessments were completed. And right now, the plan is that we would get to mechanical completion early in the part of next year and then production by the middle of the year.", "Brendan Warn - BMO Capital Markets Ltd.", "Okay, I appreciate the update.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "You bet.", "Operator", "Anish Kapadia from TPH has our next question.", "Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP", "Hi, Jeff. The first question was on Golden Pass. So I was just wondering how does that fit into your U.S. integration strategy. And has the decision by Qatar to increase its LNG capacity significantly shifted your partners' focus and I suppose your own focus in expanding production in Qatar rather than going ahead with Golden Pass?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Anish, it's a good question. As I said earlier, we've got a number of opportunities in which we can invest in order to capture that LNG demand growth. And we're progressing them all concurrently. Now, Golden Pass obviously is another key aspect of the value chain within North America gas. We're the largest producer of North American gas, so we continue to progress the opportunity there.", "As you know, after a fairly extensive period of time, earlier this year, we received the Department of Energy's authorization for export of LNG to non-FTA countries, which was an important milestone that happened in April of this year. Now we're focused on bringing together the remaining elements of the project, that being finalizing the technical definition as well as the commercial details for a final investment decision. But it is one of many opportunities that we're progressing.", "Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP", "Okay, thank you. And then I had another question. I just wanted to go back to the CapEx once again, and sorry to get back to that. I just wanted to clarify. So the way I understand the CapEx for this year, it seems like on an organic basis, if you strip out the acquisitions, it's approximately $17 billion, I think going up to $25 billion next year on an organic basis. So I just wanted to try and bridge what that gap is. So where does the incremental $8 billion come from? And the acquisition that was announced today from Statoil of approximately $1.4 billion, is that included also in the 2018 spend? Thank you.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "A couple points. One is that, remember, when we set up a budget, there's a fair bit of flexibility. And fundamentally, what we're trying to do is live within our means. We're very focused on being selective in our investment program, maintaining our capital discipline. And there may be some things that we'll decide to slow down and replace it with an opportunity that comes in. So it's not necessarily that it's 100% fixed and all of the specific budget allocations are going to be executed with whatever we came up with in our planning process.", "I'll give you a good example, and I think I've said it before. Jurong Aromatics specifically was not in our budget for 2017. And we still believe that the budget guidance that we issued almost a year ago is still staying appropriate for sharing with you all. So there are some things that will move in and out. And as a result, there is a level of change-out \u2013 or dynamic change-out going on in that forward projection. If you go back to the 2018 and 2020 forward look, we shared with you in the analyst presentation the key components that were driving those capital expenditures over that timeframe, and that's probably the best guidance I've got for you at this point.", "Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP", "Okay, thank you.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "We'll now go to Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.", "Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Good morning, Neil.", "Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Jeff, we've talked a lot about the asset deals that you've done here, whether it's InterOil, Bass, the 22,000 acres, Jurong, Mozambique. But can you talk a little bit about the corporate M&A market? Now historically you guys have said that the U.S. E&P sector, for example, was not appropriately valued or you weren't able to identify attractive opportunities at the right price as that sector has underperformed or other corporate deals that are out there. Has that bid/ask started to close from your perspective?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "I'd tell you, Neil, I would respond this way; that we're not limiting any of our potential opportunity base. So we'll keep open to where there may be attractive opportunities for us to pursue. Remember, there are two things you're trying to achieve here. One is, you're trying to \u2013 in anything you pick up, whether it'd be an asset acquisition or a corporate acquisition, you either want to get material synergy benefits or being able to add value above what the market values that asset at or both, ideally both.", "So we keep a very full look, we keep the aperture very wide on where there may be opportunities. But as you've seen here in the recent past, primarily where we see the greatest value is on asset acquisitions. Now, some of those assets were held by a single company, and that's what they had, so it ended up being one and the same. But right now, what's most attractive to us has been these asset acquisitions.", "Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Got it. That's great. And then the follow-up, Jeff, is just on your Canadian oil sands business. The ramp at Kearl has been taken a little bit longer than anticipated a few years ago, where do you stand there, and just the latest in terms of the potential sanctioning of that, recognizing that Imperial is also on a position to comment on this?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Clearly, I'll just say upfront, I mean, the Imperial organization has really worked Kearl very hard and making some really great progress. I give them a lot of credit for the progress that they're making. This is a long-lived asset, and we see the long-term value in it. It has not ramped up as we would have expected. But we have made, as I said, very good progress in reducing the cost structure and very focused on improving the reliability. And we're bringing the full capability of the organization to bear on this. And remember, this is just not the asset, we are thinking about the full value chain benefits as well. But I have the utmost confidence that the organization is going to continue to grow value on Kearl.", "And \u2013 but I think job number one right now is to get that reliability up. So we've got some work to be done there. And we are not shy about it, but we are very optimistic about where we are heading. Around future investments in the oil sands, I think I'd characterize it this way that \u2013 and, Neil, you've heard me say this before in that we are really building this business to be durable in a low-price environment. That means we've got to get the technology to the point that it is going to get the cost of supply down that regardless of where we are in the price cycle, that we're generating a very attractive return.", "And I will tell you, we've made great progress in terms of in situ technology and capability. And we're very encouraged by that progress, particularly in SA-SAGD. And \u2013 but I would say that we still got a little bit further to go. Not only are we at a point where we are able to substantially increase the overall return, but also reduce the cost, as well as reduce the environmental footprint. And that's important for us as we go forward. But we've got a very large acreage position, it's important that we get this thing right, and the organization is very focused on it.", "Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "You bet.", "Operator", "We'll go to Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James.", "Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Yeah, thanks for taking the question, guys. When your guiding to CapEx for 2018, and you talk about the $25 billion number, what's the breakdown of that between organic and acquisitions? In other words, are you baking in credit for cash outlays on acquisition activity for next year?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Good morning, Pavel. As we talked earlier, I mean, probably the best guidance I can give you right now would be going back and look at how we've segmented our investment plans between 2018 to 2020 in the Analyst Meeting. As I said earlier, if there is a transaction that we believe is very close to reaching agreement, we will typically go ahead and include it in our forward-looking investment plans, like Mozambique was for this year.", "But other than that, we keep some flexibility in our budget. And remember what we're trying to do here is, it's all about the value proposition. We're going to live within our means, we're going to manage our CapEx appropriately. We're going to keep our financial flexibility, but we are not going to forego opportunities. We've got significant financial capability to go ahead and pursue opportunities when they come up. And I think that is a unique attribute of this corporation, is that when, particularly in a down cycle, we can go ahead and respond fairly quickly when those opportunities come up. And let me say, a lot of them come up and they come up very quickly. You have got to be able to respond, and we've got the financial capability and the expertise to go ahead and accrete value on a lot of these things.", "Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "All right. That's it for me. Thanks, guys.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Thanks, Pavel.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Rob West from Redburn.", "Rob West - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.", "Hi, thanks for having me on the call. In Brazil, you talked about competitive fiscal terms. And what I wanted to ask you is, are those fiscal terms competitive with something like the Permian? And really what's behind the question is, as you look at new resource opportunities now around the world, be it Mozambique or Brazil or other ones, how much do the fiscal terms have to compete with the fiscal terms in the Permian to make you want to invest?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Yeah. Rob, think about it a couple of ways. One is, is that I think most resource owners understand that they are competing globally for investment dollars. And the key aspect of that is not only the quality of the resource endowment, but also how competitive the fiscal terms are. Are they globally competitive, are they transparent and are they stable and predictable, I mean, fundamentally? That's what's going to set for a very attractive investment climate. And where you have seen significant investment is generally tied to how those fiscal terms have supported an international investment program.", "Now, for us, Rob, it is not a kind of either or that we've got to do the Permian or we've got to do something else. As I said a moment ago, we've got sufficient financial flexibility. For us, it is the full package, the resource quality, the fiscal terms and our ability to go ahead and get to market from a value chain perspective and capture value. So it's always that value proposition.", "So we are making the trade-offs on the full value proposition to make sure that we are meeting our fundamental mission here, and that is growing shareholder value with accretive investments. Now, our portfolio is very geographically diverse, and there are some political aspects that we've got to tie into these investment decisions. And I think that's an attribute of the corporation that once again is very unique.", "Rob West - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.", "Okay. So just the first part of that question was on whether the fiscal terms in Brazil are competitive with fiscal terms in Permian. I'm not sure if you missed that one or you can't comment on it. I just wanted to go back.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "No, I really don't have anything to share on comparing and contrasting specific asset fiscal terms.", "Rob West - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.", "Let me ask another one then. And one point you've made before that I think has been well made is that your scale gives you better long term-ism when it comes to procurement, and I was wondering. In 3Q 2017, was that the case in the area of pressure pumping, where it's pretty well known there have been some bottlenecks that have been constraining completion activity? And I'm wondering. Does your scale and long-term procurement in purchases in the Permian, did it help you avoid any of that bottleneck that you can share with us?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Let me respond to you in kind of a broader perspective is that, and it's very similar to what I said earlier, Rob, where developing these long-term supplier relationships is really critical to make sure that we're all in the same page in terms of the quality standards, the operating standards that we adhere to.", "And when we see cost pressures, we are very quick to react upon, okay, how are we building in the value proposition in our go-forward plans and how do we offset those potential cost increases with more unique alternatives. It might be something as we've seen very significant in the Permian, and that's technology application. So there's been some \u2013 in 2017, by way of example, there has been some inflationary pressures largely in the unconventional business. But we have been able to offset that with these cost reductions that we are seeing in our drilling program by way of example.", "Rob West - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.", "Okay. The final one I wanted to ask you is on the San Patricio cracker that I think follows Mont Belvieu, could you just quickly give us a sense of timing on that? And start looking like that as a \u2013 something that you're going to really accelerate when Mont Belvieu finishes, or is it really longer term?", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Yeah. So this is \u2013 it's independent of where the Baytown cracker is. This is a \u2013 again, a part of the value chain. For the broader group on the phone, this is a joint \u2013 a proposed jointly owned petrochemical facility that would be a 1.8 million ton per annum ethylene steam cracker, and then derivative units monoethylene glycol plant and polyethylene plant. And we have \u2013 as you pointed out, we've selected a site in San Patricio County. And right now, we're beginning \u2013 we've been working with our partner to begin the planning for front-end engineering and design work.", "So once we get to the point where we think we've got a good laid out plan, we've moved in the permitting phase. Once we get all the ducks in a row, then we'll make a decision on whether we'd move forward with funding. But it is very well positioned on the Gulf Coast to take full advantage of the feedstock that primarily would be coming from the Permian and the Eagle Ford.", "Rob West - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.", "Okay, thanks for taking my questions. That's great.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Okay, Rob. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll now go to John Herrlin from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.", "John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale", "Yeah. Hi. Just two quick ones. Regarding Guyana and Phases 2 and 3, Jeff, will this be a lot like Angola where every two years you roll out another FPSO system? I mean, I know it's still early days, but I'm just curious.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Yeah. No \u2013 John, good morning. Very similar. I mean, if you think about my comments, you really want to get into that manufacturing mode very quickly. If you've got the resource \u2013 obviously, we're going to continue our exploration program, hopefully continue to grow the resource. You want to get into that manufacturing process because that will help continue to progress that learning curve and reduce your overall cost. So I keep on thinking about it like the Angola program that we did on Block 15.", "John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale", "Okay, great. And then one question on Brazil. Since you're getting a little further away from the initial discoveries by Petrobras and all that, are you assuming that the pay zones are going to be carbonates or clastics? And that's it for me.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "This is early days, and we've got to \u2013 like I said, we do have some of our own seismic that we are analyzing, and it's really going to be different wherever we are with the acreage that we've picked up. But in the outer Campos Basin, it's primarily carbonate pre-salt.", "John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale", "Okay, you've got a lot of experience in that, I was just curious. Petrobras certainly can use the help. Thanks.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "All right. Thank you, John.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions, I will turn it back over to you, Mr. Woodbury, for any additional or closing remarks.", "Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.", "Well, lot of good questions this morning. I really do very much appreciate your time and your thoughts that you've put behind those questions. And, of course, we look forward to our communications \u2013 our ongoing communications, and we do appreciate your interest in ExxonMobil.

Today's call is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to Exxon Mobil's fourth quarter earnings call.", "My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our Web site. Before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2.", "Turning now to Slide 3, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our 2017 performance. Exxon Mobil earned $8.4 billion in the quarter, bringing year-to-date earnings to $19.7 billion.", "Our cash flow from operations and asset sales exceeded our dividends and investments for the year by more than $1 billion. We continue advancing attractive opportunities across all our business segments.", "In the Upstream, we closed the Mozambique Area 4 acquisition and we made our sixth discovery offshore Guyana. I\u2019ll share for more detail about these items and others later in the discussion.", "Included in our results is a non-cash earnings gain of $5.9 billion resulting from U.S. tax reform. This reflects the magnitude of Exxon Mobil\u2019s historic investments in the United States. These investments have created large deferred income tax liabilities which when revalued at the new tax rate results in a one-time non-cash benefit to earnings.", "The deemed repatriation tax on foreign earnings is not significant to Exxon Mobil as we have paid taxes on non-U.S. earnings at tax rates above 35% on average. Partly offsetting this earnings benefit is $1.3 billion of fourth quarter asset impairments in the Upstream. These impairments are primarily related to non-producing assets in Canada and dry gas production operations notably in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.", "Moving to Slide 4, we provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Overall, the global economy experienced moderate growth in the quarter. Estimated GDP growth for the U.S., Eurozone and Japan softened in comparison to the third quarter. Meanwhile, economic expansion remained steady in China.", "Crude oil prices strengthened over the quarter whereas natural gas prices were mixed, as North American prices declined but prices in Europe and Asia Pacific increased. Global rig count remains steady. Finally, refining margins decreased with lower seasonal gasoline demand and global chemical margins softened due to higher feed and energy costs.", "Turning now to the financial results on Slide 5. As indicated, Exxon Mobil's fourth quarter earnings were $8.4 billion or $1.97 per share. In the quarter, corporation distributed $3.3 billion in dividends to our shareholders. ", "Our CapEx was $9 billion, reflecting the completion of our Mozambique Area 4 acquisition, bonus payments for our successful acreage bids in Brazil and increased activity in our unconventional portfolio. All of these are key elements of our future growth potential.", "Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $8.8 billion, including proceeds from asset sales of $1.4 billion, driven by divestment of some operated Upstream assets in Norway as well as our Norwegian retail network. Cash totaled $3.2 billion at the end of the quarter and debt was $42.3 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion from the prior quarter due to increased CapEx.", "The next slide provides additional detail on sources and uses of cash. Over the quarter, cash balances decreased from $4.3 billion to $3.2 billion. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program, yielded $8.8 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. A negative adjustment for working capital and other items mainly reflects changes in deferred tax balances from U.S. tax reform.", "Uses of cash included shareholder distributions of $3.3 billion and net investments in the business of $7.9 billion. An increase in debt and other financing items increased cash by $1.3 billion. In the first quarter of 2018, Exxon Mobil will limit share purchases to amounts needed to offset dilution related to our benefits plans and programs.", "Moving on to Slide 7 for a review of our segmented results. Exxon Mobil's fourth quarter earnings increased $6.7 billion from a year-ago quarter due to non-cash impacts of U.S. tax reform and impairments as well as improved Upstream results as tax reform added $5.9 billion to earnings while the fourth quarter asset impairments of nearly $1.3 billion were more than offset by the absence of impairments in the prior year quarter.", "The Upstream business increased earnings $1 billion primarily due to stronger prices. This was partly offset by higher expenses in the corporate and financing segment primarily due to the absence of favorable, one-time non-U.S. tax items in the fourth quarter of 2016.", "Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results starting on Slide 8. Fourth quarter Upstream earnings were $8.4 billion, an increase of $9 billion from the prior-year quarter, driven by non-cash impacts and higher realizations. Largest of these was the result of U.S. tax reform.", "Also as I mentioned earlier, we took impairments of $1.3 billion. These were associated with non-producing assets, including Horn River and the Mackenzie Gas in Canada as well as dry gas producing assets, mostly in the Gulf of Mexico. There were more than offset by the absence of last year\u2019s fourth quarter impairments.", "Realizations increased earnings by $1.2 billion. Crude prices rose nearly $11 per barrel versus the year-ago quarter, whereas gas realizations increased about $0.60 per 1,000 cubic feet. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $110 million due to lower entitlements and mix effects.", "All other items decreased earnings by $60 million. Upstream unit profitability for the quarter was $7.07 per barrel, excluding U.S. tax reform, impairments and the impact of non-controlling interest volumes. ", "Moving now to Slide 9. Oil equivalent production in the quarter was 4 million barrels per day, a decrease of 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Liquids production decreased 133,000 barrels per day as field decline, lower entitlements and divestment of some Norwegian assets more than offset volumes from new projects and more programs.", "Natural gas production increased 17 million cubic feet per day. Growth from projects and work programs and higher entitlements were probably offset by decline, reduced demand and regulatory impacts in the Netherlands as the new gas year began in October.", "Moving now to the Downstream financial and operating results on Slide 10. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $1.6 billion, up $323 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Stronger margins, mainly in the U.S., increased earnings by $250 million. Unfavorable volume and mix effects decreased earnings by 190 million mainly from increased maintenance activities.", "All other items reduced earnings by $350 million, mostly due to the absence of asset management gains of the prior year quarter, including over $500 million related to the sale of Canadian retail assets. This was partially offset by asset management gains in the current quarter. U.S. tax reform had a positive impact of over $600 million.", "Moving now to the Chemical financial and operating results on Slide 11. Fourth quarter Chemical earnings were $1.3 billion, up almost $400 million compared to the prior-year quarter. Weaker specialty margins due to increased feed and energy costs decreased earnings by $30 million.", "Favorable volume and mix effects reflecting our highest product sales in a decade improved earnings by $100 million. All other items decreased earnings by 10 million. And U.S. tax reform had a positive impact of $335 million.", "Turning now to the summary of our full year 2017 financial results on Slide 12. As I mentioned, 2017 earnings totaled $19.7 billion or $4.63 per share. Corporation distributed $13 billion in dividends to our shareholders.", "CapEx totaled $23.1 billion for the year reflecting our commitment to pursuing high-value opportunities. Our financial strength and flexibility enabled us to capitalize on opportunities that arose throughout the year such as the acquisition of Jurong Aromatics in Singapore and our success in the Brazil bid rounds while still remaining within 5% of our original 2017 guidance. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $33.2 billion. And year-end debt was $42.3 billion, down $0.5 billion from the beginning of the year.", "Turning to Slide 13. Cash decreased from $3.7 billion to $3.2 billion in the year. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program, resulted in 33 billion of cash flow from operations in asset sales. And negative working capital and other impacts for the year were again largely driven by changes in deferred tax balances from U.S. tax reform.", "Uses of the cash include shareholder distributions of $13 billion and net investments of almost 19 billion. Debt and other financing items decreased cash by 1.8 billion. This includes anti-dilutive purchases of about $0.5 billion.", "Moving to Slide 14. This graph illustrates the corporation\u2019s sources and uses of cash during the year and it highlights our ability to meet our financial objectives. The corporation generated solid cash flow from operations and asset sales which more than covered our dividend and net investments in the business. Our strong cash generation and balance sheet continued to provide the financial flexibility to invest in attractive opportunities.", "During the year, Exxon Mobil generated $14.3 billion of free cash flow, up nearly 50% from 2016, primarily due to the stronger price environment and our disciplined approach to investing.", "As indicated, shareholder distributions totaled $13 billion. Annual per share dividends were up 2.7% compared to 2016, marking the 35th consecutive year of per share dividend growth. Looking ahead, we anticipate our 2018 capital and exploration expenditures will be about $24 billion.", "While we continue to invest across all segments, this increase compared to 2017 is primarily driven by higher investment in short-cycle Upstream opportunities, notably U.S. unconventional activity and conventional work programs, both of which yield attractive returns at $40 per barrel.", "We\u2019re also pursuing strategic investments in the Downstream and Chemical businesses. Now I know there is a lot of interest in our investment plans and we\u2019ll share more details including clarity on the value proposition at our Analyst Meeting in early March.", "Moving now to Slide 15 and a full review of our full year segmented results. 2017 earnings increased almost $12 billion due to U.S. tax reform and impairments, higher realizations in the Upstream and higher margins in the Downstream. Probably offsetting these gains were higher expenses in our corporate and financing segment primarily due to the absence of favorable one-time non-U.S. tax items in 2016.", "In light of the new U.S. tax rate, we expect our corporate and financing expenses to range from $600 million to $800 million per quarter. In the first quarter of 2018, we expect this expense to be at the high end of this range. Further guidance will be shared later in the year as we continue to evaluate the full impact of tax reform. Our full year effective tax rate was 5%, which includes the impact of tax reform and impairments. Excluding these impacts, our full year 2017 tax rate was 35%.", "2018 assuming current commodity prices and the existing portfolio mix, we anticipate that the effective tax rate will remain between 25% and 35%, excluding the impact of any large one-time items. This guidance also includes the expected impact of U.S. tax reform.", "Turning now to the full year comparison of Upstream results starting on Slide 16. Full year Upstream earnings were $13.4 billion, an increase of over $13 billion from the prior year. The largest contributing factors were U.S. tax reform, impairments and higher realizations.", "Crude prices rose more than $10 per barrel versus 2016 and gas realizations increased about $0.80 per 1,000 cubic feet. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $440 million primarily due to lower entitlements.", "All other items increased earnings $510 million driven by lower operating expenses which were partly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Excluding the impact of U.S. tax reform, impairments and non-controlling interest volumes, Upstream unit profitability for 2017 was almost $5.50 per barrel.", "Moving to Slide 17. Full year oil equivalent production was 4 million barrels per day, a decrease of 2% compared to 2016. Liquids production decreased 82,000 barrels per day. Growth from new project volumes and work programs were more than offset by field decline, lower entitlements and asset sales.", "Natural gas production increased 84 million cubic feet per day. Volumes from projects and work programs were partly offset by a decline, regulatory impacts and reduced demand.", "Full year comparison for Downstream results is shown on Slide 18. Downstream earnings were $5.6 billion, an increase of 1.4 billion from 2016. Stronger margins across all regions increased earnings by about 1.5 billion.", "Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $30 million due to lower throughput caused by Hurricane Harvey and higher maintenance activities in the U.S. These were mostly offset by improved operations in Europe and Asia.", "All other items decreased earnings $710 million. This is primarily driven by the absence of last year\u2019s $900 million gain related to the sale of Canadian retail assets and expenses related to the hurricane. This was partly offset by asset management gains in the current year. U.S. tax reform and lower impairments increased earnings by $664 million.", "On Slide 19, we show the full year comparison with Chemical results. 2017 earnings were $4.5 billion, down almost 100 million from 2016. Weaker commodity and specialty margins, driven by increased feed and energy costs, decreased earnings by $260 million.", "Favorable volume and mix effects added 100 million driven by stronger demand, partly offset by impacts of Hurricane Harvey. All other items reduced earnings by $270 million reflecting higher expenses from turnarounds and new business growth. U.S. tax reform increased earnings by $335 million.", "Moving next to an update on some of our key business highlights. First, we\u2019ve had continued success at offshore Guyana. As indicated, we announced our sixth offshore discovery with the successful Ranger well. And importantly, this well proves yet another new play in the Stabroek block.", "The well encountered 230 feet of oil-bearing carbonate reservoirs. We are encouraged by these results and have further work ahead to determine the full commercial potential of this resource. We\u2019ll likely drill a delineation well later this year.", "To-date, we have discovered more than 3.2 billion oil equivalent barrels of recoverable resource on the Stabroek block and this excludes the recent Ranger discovery. Rig has now moved to the Pacora prospect where it has spud another well cap well near the Payara discovery.", "Our phase development of the Liza discovery is progressing with Phase 1 on track for first oil in March of 2020. Development drilling is planned to start this year. A second drilling rig is in route to Guyana and we envision a two-rig drilling program through the end of the year.", "We\u2019ve also submitted an application for environmental permit to develop the second phase of Liza. Concept includes a larger FPSO and subsea systems. This facility concept we have production capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day with start-up expected by mid-2022.", "Payara is now planned as the third development offshore Guyana, mostly following Liza Phase 2. Payara has the potential to raise Guyana\u2019s production to about 450,000 barrels of oil per day in total.", "Turning to Slide 21, we\u2019ll provide an update on some activities that are positioning Exxon Mobil to provide low cost of supply natural gas to meet growing global demand. In December, we announced the completion of our transaction to acquire a 25% indirect interest in Mozambique\u2019s gas-rich Area 4 block.", "Exxon Mobil will lead the onshore construction and operation of all future natural gas liquefaction facilities with scope of more than 40 million tons of LNG per year. Eni will continue to lead the Coral South floating LNG project in all Upstream operations in Area 4. Part of the deal closure, we have funded our share of participation in the Coral project.", "We\u2019ve also secunded a number of employees into Eni\u2019s project organization in key roles to leverage our extensive global LNG and project development experience. We are proud to bring our LNG leadership and experience to Mozambique to support development of this world-class resource.", "Now in Papua New Guinea, we encountered hydrocarbons in the P\u2019nyang South appraisal well where we found high-quality sandstone reservoirs. This successful well confirms the Southeast extension of the field, a growing inventory of natural gas resources in Papua New Guinea and support a multi-train expansion of our PNG, LNG facilities.", "In offshore Cyprus, plans are progressing for Block 10. Acquisition of a 3D seismic survey was completed in 2017. The first well on the block in this promising gas-prone region is planned to spud later this year.", "Lastly, we signed production sharing contracts with the government of Mauritania for three deepwater offshore blocks. Together, these blocks cover nearly 8.4 million acres in water depths up to 11,500 feet. Exploration activity, including seismic acquisition, is planned to begin this year following government ratification of the contracts.", "Moving to Slide 22. Exxon Mobil continues to demonstrate its project execution expertise by starting up two projects in the fourth quarter of 2017, both of which were executed safely and on schedule in challenging operating environments.", "The Hebron project offshore Newfoundland and Labrador achieved first oil in November. The project consists of the gravity-based structure which will be able to produce up to 150,000 barrels of oil per day at its peak. Total recoverable resources are estimated to exceed 700 million barrels of oil.", "In eastern Russia, the Odoptu Stage 2 project, another arctic development, started in December. The project increases the Odoptu field production capacity to 65,000 barrels per day.", "And in Abu Dhabi, we are continuing our efforts to increase production at Upper Zakum. The Upper Zakum 750 project is making excellent progress, currently producing approximately 670,000 barrels of oil per day. We\u2019ve been steadily increasing production on all four artificial islands.", "The joint venture partners recently signed an agreement to pursue further production growth with plans to increase production to 1 million barrels per day by 2024. Expansion will continue to use extended-reach drilling and completion technologies as well as state-of-the-art reservoir characterization and modeling techniques to effectively position wells. Infrastructure and facilities will be further expanded in a modular approach maximizing capital efficiency and lowering costs.", "Turning now to Slide 23. The graph on the right shows our progress to-date on development of our unconventional liquids volumes. Our total production from the Delaware, Midland, and Bakken basins is now about 200,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. We are progressing plans to ramp up to around 36 operated rigs in the Permian and Bakken by year end, of which 30 will be in the Delaware and Midland basins.", "With a continued focus on maximizing capital efficiency, we are drilling long lateral wells made possible by our contiguous acreage position. We\u2019re incorporating learnings real time and continue to optimize both the lateral lengths and completion designs.", "In the Bakken, for example, we\u2019ve made significant progress improving productivity through optimized completions. Recent wells had initial production rates in the top quintile of surrounding industry wells with the best 30-day average rate exceeding 2,500 barrels of oil per day.", "Looking forward, these longer laterals with optimized completions could potentially generate a 15% to 20% increase in our expected ultimate recovery from the Bakken wells, further supporting our growth plans in tight oil. We expect to drill another 15 to 20 three-mile lateral wells in the Bakken this year.", "Transferring our learnings from the Bakken into the Permian, we recently started producing our first 12,500-foot lateral well in the Delaware Basin. This well has successfully met our pre-drill expectations. Also, we recently finished drilling our first three-mile lateral in the Midland Basin and we\u2019re currently drilling our second.", "We\u2019ve continued to grow our service understanding in the Permian, integrating information from our own drilled wells and those on offsetting acreage. With multiple pay zones on our Delaware Basin acreage, we are working to evaluate the full prospectively of these stacked intervals.", "To support our production growth plans, Exxon Mobil will be investing more than $2 billion in Midstream infrastructure, including expansion of the Wink terminal. This will build additional takeaway flexibility to efficiently move production from the Permian to Exxon Mobil\u2019s manufacturing facilities in the Gulf Coast region. We will share additional information about our plans for the Permian Basin at our upcoming Analyst Meeting.", "Moving now to the final slide, I\u2019d like to conclude today\u2019s prepared remarks with a summary of our 2017 performance which demonstrates our relentless focus on value, underpinned by the unique strengths of our company.", "Our integrated businesses have grown cash flow from operations and asset sales to over $33 billion and earnings to almost $20 billion. Excluding U.S. tax reform and impairments, our business segments have earned over $15 billion, an increase of more than 50% compared to 2016.", "Upstream production volumes were within our guidance range at 4 million oil equivalent barrels per day. Our investment in high-quality opportunities across all segments resulted in total 2017 capital expenditures of just over $23 billion.", "We continue to invest in our business through attractive opportunities, including strategic acquisitions across the value chain. These investments set the foundation to continue generating value for our shareholders for many years to come.", "Our free cash flow of over $14 billion more than covered our shareholder distributions of $13 billion. Finally, we remain committed to a reliable and growing dividend as evidenced by increasing our dividends per share for the 35th consecutive year.", "Entering 2018, we believe our integrated businesses positioned with a robust portfolio and a strong pipeline of high-quality projects will continue to deliver long-term value for our shareholders.", "We\u2019ll discuss our forward plans in more detail at the upcoming Analyst Meeting which will take place at the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, March 7. We have an aggressive plan to drive value growth and we will look forward to the conversation with you.", "So that concludes my prepared remarks. I would now be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Woodbury. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI.", "Doug Terreson", "Good morning, everybody.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Good morning, Doug.", "Doug Terreson", "Jeff, returns in Exxon Mobil\u2019s Downstream business were sustained at really high levels in decades past and you guys still lead almost every global peer from what I can tell. Simultaneously in the Upstream, while the company is rightfully enthusiastic about its Permian business as indicated by your recent guidance in that area and some of your slides today, returns elsewhere in the Upstream declined fairly meaningfully in recent years and they appear to be in need of remediation. So while your peers have the same problem, several of them have provided plans for improvement and time periods of which they expect to improve their performance. So, my first is that with the Analyst Meeting coming up, why wouldn\u2019t a company specify an improvement plan for Upstream since it\u2019s around 80% of corporate capital employed and it\u2019s probably the driver of Exxon Mobil stock which is obviously really important to you guys? And then second, do you think that Exxon Mobil\u2019s emphasis on the industry-leading financial performance rather than an absolute return target better serve shareholders when considering that a lot of your peers had declining returns over kind of the last decade or so? So it\u2019s two questions but it\u2019s really on the same topic.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Doug, on the first topic, the real objective for the corporation as you know is to very clearly make the investment case that of our growth prospects and the fundamental mission of creating long-term shareholder value. We are going to detail out in the Analyst Meeting the value proposition that we see. As I said, we have an aggressive growth plan across all three business segments. We\u2019ve got three world-class businesses that have very robust portfolios that we are going to fully leverage to go ahead and lay out that value proposition over the long term. So I certainly acknowledge the drop that we\u2019ve seen in the Upstream business and the return on capital employed and I think we\u2019re going to lay out a growth plan that\u2019s going to demonstrate where we\u2019re heading in not only to enhance the Upstream return but furthermore continue to build in the Downstream and Chemical businesses which I think you recognize are very important to the corporation as a whole given our independent business model.", "Doug Terreson", "Well, I think that would be great. Sorry, Jeff, go ahead.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Go ahead, Doug.", "Doug Terreson", "I was just going to say, well, I think that would be welcomed and rewarded in the market. More specifics, the better obviously but I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt you.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes, and just following up on the last part about the return on capital employed, I think we\u2019ve talked in the past that that remains a key objective for the corporation. I know there\u2019s a lot of interest about our capital investment program. I think we\u2019re going to demonstrate the quality of the portfolio and that our shareholders are best served for us to continue to invest to capture that value.", "Doug Terreson", "Okay. Thanks a lot, Jeff. We look forward to it.", "Jeff Woodbury", "All right. Thanks, Doug.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Doug Leggate", "Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Jeff, I wonder if I could start by taking you back to the cash flow. I understand you tried to walk us through some of the moving parts, but oil up quite nicely in the quarter and your cash flow is flat it looks like on an underlying basis. Can you walk us through whether there\u2019s any unusual situations going on in there whether it\u2019d be hurricane related or cost or anything like that? It just is kind of hard to explain why the cash flow is as light as it was and maybe explain a little better on the working capital move?", "Jeff Woodbury", "On the cash flow, as I explained in the prepared comments, Doug, the big impact is obviously in the working capital and other and that was primarily driven by the U.S. tax reform. There were other less significant changes to the deferred tax balances that impacted cash flow. As I said, in that cash flow we had assets sales of about 1.5 billion largely associated with some of our Norwegian divestments in our operated Upstream and our retail sector.", "Doug Leggate", "Sure. So I\u2019m thinking more of the ex-asset sales number, I don\u2019t want to belabor the point, but just to be clear. So if it\u2019s largely nonrecurring, you\u2019re underlying cash flow then would have been closer to 13 billion, is that right or am I missing something?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes, I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019re coming up with that calculation, Doug, to be able to comment on it.", "Doug Leggate", "7.4 plus the 6.5 basically. Working capital draw 6 and change and your underlying was you reported 7.5 ex the asset sales. Am I wrong?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes, remember the earnings include the upwards associated with the U.S. tax reform. You got to back that \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s happening in the cash flow analyses. You\u2019ve got $5.9 billion in U.S. tax reform benefits in the earnings and then in the working capital and other you\u2019re backing that out to come out with the cash.", "Doug Leggate", "Okay. So that\u2019s really the roots of my question and so if I look at ex all that out, you\u2019re underlying cash flow was flat sequentially on a significant increase in oil price. What\u2019s going on?", "Jeff Woodbury", "When you look at overall unit profitability, it remains strong on the assets. We had a number of one-time effects in our portfolio that I talked about in my prepared comments that lowered the overall \u2013 in fact in several of the segments that lowered the overall earnings in that quarter.", "Doug Leggate", "Okay. I\u2019ll take it offline and maybe go in more detail. Let me try one final one if I may and it\u2019s on the increase in the rig count. So the chart you\u2019ve shown I think is the same chart you\u2019ve shown multiple times before. But you have, if I\u2019m not mistaken, taken the rig count up. So why are we not seeing any increase in the production guide?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Doug, you\u2019re talking about the Permian and Bakken now?", "Doug Leggate", "Yes. So I think you talked about 30 rigs by the end of '18 previously and now you\u2019re talking 36.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes. So as you can see from the display, you can see that we are tracking in the guidance that we provided. We did have a bit of downtime in the fourth quarter associated with weather notably in the Bakken and you can see that in the variation on the red line that\u2019s tracking. We\u2019re doing well in terms of working off the ducts [ph] that have built up. And I think we\u2019re right on our plans in terms of ramping up.", "Doug Leggate", "All right. I\u2019ll wait for the Analyst Day. Thanks.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.", "Paul Sankey", "Hi, Jeff. Jeff, can I just follow up on Doug\u2019s question about working capital? Can we just have the working capital number alone?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Working capital number alone --", "Paul Sankey", "For the shift in the quarters. Sorry.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes, the working capital alone in the quarter is just $200 million.", "Paul Sankey", "And that\u2019s the amount of working capital or the change \u2013 what we\u2019re trying to get to is the sequential --", "Jeff Woodbury", "I\u2019m sorry.", "Paul Sankey", "So basically \u2013 so to further what Doug Leggate said, the sequential cash flow is essentially flat.", "Jeff Woodbury", "That\u2019s right.", "Paul Sankey", "Okay. Thanks. If we could go on just to your volumes, I can imagine that the 40s impact was significant on oil in Europe. I would assume that the African problem in terms of declining volumes was PSC effects in Nigeria maybe. We\u2019re also seeing some weakness in Asia. These are all liquids questions, Jeff. Could you just run around the world and kind of give us the reasons for the issues in the liquids volumes? Thank you.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes, if you look at the quarter-on-quarter volumes, you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s really broken up into three key components, which is taken by thirds \u2013 about a third of it is associated with PSC effects driven by the higher prices. The second third is associated with asset sales. And on the liquids side that is all associated with our sale of our operated assets in Norway on Upstream. And then the last third is primarily associated with a base decline in our portfolio offset by project and work program build up.", "Paul Sankey", "That\u2019s great. Thank you. My final question is, Jeff, there\u2019s a lot of press around $50 billion of spending which you\u2019re going to make in the U.S. It wasn\u2019t quite what was written in downwards press release. I think it was a blog post that you guys put out. I wasn\u2019t sure \u2013 and it was kind of not by Darren but by everyone else was kind of tied to the tax reform that we\u2019ve seen here in the U.S. Can you just talk a little bit about how much incremental capital in the U.S. you\u2019re going to spend as a result of the tax changes and sort of if you could annualize the number, it would be helpful just to get a small clarity on your spending over the coming years? Thank you.", "Jeff Woodbury", "There\u2019s a couple of elements to what you\u2019re talking about. One is the 50 billion that we had projected in the U.S. over the next five years, let me give you a little bit color on the 50 billion. About two-thirds of that is in the Upstream portfolio. As you would anticipate, a lot of that is in our unconventional activity. The rest is split fairly evenly between our Downstream and our Chemical portfolios. If you look at the quality of those investments, as you would expect they\u2019re very robust in the Upstream unconventional business and the rest of the conventional work program generated greater than 10% return on investment at a $40 flat rail. The Downstream and Chemical investments are 15% to 20% plus. So that\u2019s kind of the forward definition of the anticipated spend in the U.S. over the next five years. Think about the overall U.S. tax reform and the way I\u2019d characterize is the following that we clearly believe that the reform will make the investment climate more attractive. It will lead to things like capital inflow, group profitability, new jobs, ultimately higher returns for savings plans. The same is true for Exxon Mobil and we believe the changes will help strengthen our investment plans. The 50 billion that we\u2019ve talked about is a projection. We haven\u2019t made a decision to move forward with those investments at this point, but certainly the U.S. tax reform is going to strengthen and build that investment confidence. So really what the message was just one of we\u2019re encouraged by an improved competitive positioning within the U.S. for an investment climate. We\u2019ve got 50 billion that we\u2019ve got projected going forward. We\u2019ve got some other projects that are on the table that are not in the 50 billion that we\u2019re \u2013 in light of the current tax basis, we are going to step back and take a look at. So other than that, I don\u2019t have any other specifics to break out specific dollars associated with incremental expenditures on the U.S. tax reform.", "Paul Sankey", "No, but that was helpful. Thank you, Jeff.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Thank you, Paul.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.", "Phil Gresh", "Hi. Good morning, Jeff. My question is a follow up to Paul\u2019s just around the production. I appreciate the color around the thirds breakout. If you look at the base plus projects piece, it\u2019s about a third that looks like that would be about down 1% year-over-year. I\u2019m wondering how you feel about that performance in 2017 and how we should think about 2018 specifically? Obviously there were projects coming out in '17 but there are also maybe some one-time factors in 2017. So is that something that you\u2019d expect to grow in 2018, given that the other two pieces could be a little bit more nonrecurring?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes, good question, Phil. Let me take the prior discussion from a quarter-on-quarter dialogue to a year-on-year. And if you look at the year-on-year volumes, down 2% overall. Liquids is primarily driven by entitlement effects, price effects and divestments. Liquids is actually up in everything in the rest of the variables. So as we think going forward, a key driver for our volumes and we\u2019ve detailed for you is the unconventional growth program. We\u2019ve got some projects that we still expect to start up in 2018. But more specifically as we sit down in the Analyst Meeting next month, we\u2019re going to lay out what that looks like in terms of volume growth.", "Phil Gresh", "Okay. The essence of the question was, you generally have expected 4.0 to 4.4 have long-term range and you came in below that. So I was trying to think through 2018 specifically realizing you\u2019ll give more longer term color later.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes. Let me just clarify your comment. When we gave that range, it was ex asset sales and entitlements. So my point being is, is that if you look at 2017 to 2016 reconciliation, the deviation is primarily or is all in those areas.", "Phil Gresh", "Sure. Okay.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Simply put, higher prices drove the volumes down and we went ahead and monetized some assets that we thought we can get greater value from on the market as opposed to continuing operations. Again, as we go forward we\u2019re going to go ahead and detail that out as to what our current views are in terms of our investment program and how that will impact our volumes.", "Phil Gresh", "Okay. My second question was just on the capital allocation. I think some investors were hoping that perhaps you would announce a buyback for 2018 given the strength of the balance sheet and the higher oil price environment? And I know Exxon generally views it as a flywheel. But given your capital spending number for 2018, it would seem like you would have some potential room to do that if oil prices hold where they are. So just if you can update us conceptually and how you think about that?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes. So, Phil not \u2013 we haven\u2019t changed our view on how we manage our capital allocation. First and foremost is that we\u2019re going to continue to invest in attractive opportunities that are accretive to our overall financial performance. As we\u2019ve said many times and as I said today, we\u2019re going to maintain our commitment to a reliable and growing dividend. And then with excess cash, we\u2019ll decide whether there are more opportunities that we can invest in or do we go ahead and return that to the shareholder via buyback program. And we think about that on a quarterly basis. We look at a number of factors to assess whether we want to go ahead and buy shares or we want to pursue some additional opportunities. But I think the underlying message in what I\u2019m trying to convey is that we have a very attractive investment opportunity and we really do believe that we can generate a better shareholder return by pursuing these investments if they\u2019re ready to go ahead and be funded. But like I\u2019ve said before in the past that we\u2019re not going to hold large cash reserves and if we don\u2019t have immediate use to put that to work, we will go ahead and purchase some shares back as a means for shareholder distributions.", "Phil Gresh", "Okay. Thanks, Jeff.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Thanks, Phil.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.", "Neil Mehta", "Hi. Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Good morning, Neil.", "Neil Mehta", "Jeff, can we talk about the $24 billion 2018 capital spending? The previous number was around 25, so it shaved lower. Is that just a function of deflation? And historically there\u2019s been a couple billion dollars of M&A-related capital spending in there. So any color in terms of how we should think about what that organic CapEx level is? And then if you could just juxtapose that against whatever 2017 organic CapEx was ex-acquisition just to help us frame the bridge from '17 to '18 spending?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes, sure. So as you know there was a fair bit of inorganic CapEx in 2017. And if you look at the build from 2017 to 2018 just ballpark numbers, you\u2019re talking about a $5 billion to $6 billion increase in organic \u2013 total CapEx in organic activity. Now I will highlight that there is some inorganic funds in that 2018 which is associated with the payments for the farm-in in Brazil for the North Carcara field. So what does that increase represent? It really represents \u2013 the lion share of it is in the Upstream business. Again, mostly it\u2019s associated with the unconventional work program and some conventional work program across our global portfolio. As I indicated before when we were talking about the five-year projection of $50 billion, that is a very attractive investment. We\u2019ve got \u2013 at a low price forecast we\u2019ve got returns in excess of 10% with a $40 per barrel flat rail. I would tell you the investment plan is optimize to achieve attractive returns even in a low price environment. And the plan includes \u2013 it does include some investments to maintain our license to operate as well as investments that have attractive future potential. But the lion share of that increase year-on-year is associated with more short-cycle investment that is highly attractive even in a low price environment.", "Neil Mehta", "Got it, Jeff. And the follow up and you and I talked about this last month, but how you\u2019re thinking about M&A in this environment, whether it is \u2013 when you think about where you see value as a company? Is it still in the private market or how do you think about the public market as well? Historically, the message has been that the value has been more on the private market.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes, really no fundamental change. We\u2019re not going to filter out potential opportunities. We\u2019re going to keep a wide brief and make sure that aperture is wide open. And if there is something that we can identify that could effectively compete with our existing inventory investment opportunities, well then obviously it makes a lot of sense for the corporation to go ahead and pursue it. But to-date, as you\u2019ve seen, they\u2019re probably much more focused on assets that we see synergistic benefits with our existing operations as well as where we bring a capability where we can get additional value for the assets and what the market maybe valuing it at. And I would highlight for the group that if you look at what we did over 2017, we did a nice job in taking full advantage of the market conditions and picked up some high quality, very competitive opportunities that has really positioned our portfolio even in a stronger state than it was historically. And that\u2019s part of what we\u2019re going to be talking about in the upcoming Analyst Meeting.", "Neil Mehta", "All right, Jeff. Thank you.", "Jeff Woodbury", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.", "Ryan Todd", "Great. Thanks. Maybe a couple questions on LNG. You have a little bit in there in the presentation on Mozambique. The deal is closed. You suggest that it could be upwards of 40 megatons a year which is a big capacity. Can you talk a little bit about how you think about long-term development of the assets there, the timing of the development path there in Mozambique and maybe what \u2013 is the assumption that you would supply all of the relevant gas from Area 4 or would you look to bridge that with Area 1 as well in the region there?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Ryan, as I said, a very high quality. We believe it\u2019s well on the left side of the cost of supply curve. So it\u2019s going to compete very well in the market. A very substantial resource, over 85 trillion cubic feet in place. And there\u2019s clearly synergies to be had between Area 1 and Area 4. We just closed the deal. We\u2019ve got an engagement with all the partners to lay out the forward development schedule. So it\u2019s really too early for us to convey specifics in terms of what program in the timeline, but I can tell you that this is going to take a central focus on our development planning efforts to make sure that we\u2019re getting at it just like you\u2019ve seen us do in other places like Guyana and Papua New Guinea. And then on top of that you\u2019re probably aware that we have exploration acreage in the area that we\u2019re also progressing concurrently that has some really high prospectively. So I\u2019ll leave it there.", "Ryan Todd", "And maybe as a follow up on LNG, with \u2013 I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve talked about this in the past, but with Mozambique not closed, you have additional appraisal success there in PNG. Golden Pass LNG was always kind of in the hopper at some point as well. How do you think about \u2013 and it feels like the environment is improving from a gas, sales and contracting point of view. I guess first is, is that true? And then how do you think about the timing of the relative priority of these LNG projects? And is it necessary to stagger them or would you actually see benefits in proceeding with multiple LNG projects simultaneously?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Let\u2019s start with the fundamentals. If you look at the supply/demand projection, we\u2019ve got gas growing at about 1.5% per year between now and 2040 and we\u2019ve got LNG growing over two times over this time period. So that is the prize that we\u2019re working towards. Now of course in order to compete for that, we have got to have the lowest cost of supply. And you\u2019ve highlighted two key areas, Papua New Guinea and Mozambique, we think will compete very strongly for that. Now obviously there\u2019s a \u2013 with any LNG project, there is a very large upfront capital investment. We typically have walked in these funding decisions on long-term LNG contracts. We\u2019ve got very strong marketing connections and a very strong reputation in the market. So we\u2019re out there going ahead and putting in place the commercial structure. But fundamentally, Ryan, it really needs to be robust enough to underpin such a substantial investment. But we\u2019re very positive about where we\u2019re heading with it. We think we\u2019re going to be very competitive with offerings that we have in both those assets as well as some others that we\u2019re pursuing. And you\u2019ll hear more about the details as we go into the Analyst Meeting.", "Ryan Todd", "Okay. Thank you.", "Jeff Woodbury", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brendan Warn with BMO Capital Markets.", "Brendan Warn", "Hi, Jeff. Just two questions, I guess first question on Chemicals. Can you just give us an update on the timing of your new capacity and I\u2019d appreciate it if you can make some comments on your outlook for heading into some any other supply and just your view on margins over the next 12 months? And then my second question was just related to the 2 billion you announced in terms of additional infrastructure spend related to the Permian, is that included within the 24 billion or is it over the next few years? Can you just clarify that number for me please?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes. Well, on the first one in terms of our Chemical business and our investments, obviously \u2013 let me go back to the fundamentals again here. We\u2019ve got from an ethylene demand perspective, we see ethylene growing about 5 million tons per year that will require about three to four world-class crackers per year to be started up. That is \u2013 the objective that we\u2019ve is to compete in that space. And we\u2019re very close to bringing our Baytown crackers online later this year. And then we\u2019re still working the potential greenfield steam cracker development in South Texas which we add another 1.8 million tons per annum of potential capacity. But one of the advantages that we bring to that is, is not only do we have a good source of low cost advantage feed stock but we also have proprietary technologies that offer a premium product. And what I\u2019m speaking to is metallocene polyethylene. So with that demand projection and our ability through our integration and our technology to compete, that is a significant growth area and one that we\u2019re going to talk about next month as well. When you talk about \u2013 I think your other question was around the $2 billion that we discussed in investing in the Permian business, those are really so commensurate with the build-up of the volumes that we showed out to 2025. And there are really two components to it. One is expanding the Wink terminal. We currently have permitted capacity about 100,000 barrels a day at Wink and we\u2019ll expand and commensurate with the growth projection than you see in the prepared remarks I gave. And then the second one is to add additional takeaway capacity and those expenditures would occur over this timeframe of about five years or so.", "Brendan Warn", "Okay. Thanks for the update.", "Jeff Woodbury", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.", "Roger Read", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Good morning, Roger.", "Roger Read", "I guess we can \u2013 since the focus of this call the CapEx increase and I know more will come at the Analyst Day, but as you think about the 50 billion from both an Upstream and a Downstream and Chemical side, what is your \u2013 or what is baked in there in terms of a cost inflation? I just think about when we\u2019ve seen major projects kickoff in a particular area, we always seem to get some of that. And then obviously in the Upstream side we are seeing some cost inflation on the well completion side. So maybe just kind of give us an idea of how you combat that within this big program?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Well, it\u2019s an important aspect to make sure that we deliver on the financial performance of these investments. And when we lay out the projects and specifically individual execution plans for the investments, we\u2019re very mindful about what can we bring to bear in order to really reduce the structural cost of these investments. And if you look over the last couple of years, I think over the last two years, we were able to reduce kind of near-term project inventory cost by about 30% down. And there\u2019s a number of synergies that we\u2019re picking up. We\u2019re applying certain technologies, execution strategies and then we have built all that into our forward projection of investment notably within the long-cycle capital-intensive projects but also as you\u2019ve seen us explain in our short-cycle business how we continue to build that learning curve going forward. So while we always got to be mindful about how these investments can create inflationary pressures, we also detail out these plans to make sure that we\u2019ve put the right mitigators in place and we have strategies that will ensure that we can deliver on the investment expectations. So our view is that we\u2019re going to continue to combat any type of inflationary pressures by these type of cost reduction initiatives that we\u2019ve demonstrated over the last several years.", "Roger Read", "Okay. Thanks for that. And then kind of a follow up of some of the cash flow questions and then obviously the portfolio expansion you\u2019ve done through the various acquisitions and investments here recently. Asset sales relatively light in '17 and I know you don\u2019t guide a specific number for asset sales, but I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019re upgrading the portfolio in terms of future development, should we anticipate over the next couple of years maybe a slightly more aggressive hiving off of some of the more mature assets that are out there, especially thinking with this higher oil price potential buyers are a little more liquid?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes. Well, Roger, as you know, we have an ongoing asset management program that\u2019s really designed to identify what assets we should be considering and testing the market with that in order to get greater value for monetizing them from continuing our operations. And if you look over the last five years, we\u2019ve had \u2013 in fact from way back, we\u2019ve had a very active divestment program, very successful divestment program. And if you look at the last five years, we\u2019ve sold over I think it\u2019s like $21 billion, $22 billion of assets in terms of proceeds from those sales which is about $4 billion a year. So in total, 4 billion a year has been about an average for us over an extended period of time. This year it is a little bit light compared to what we have done in the recent past. But we will continue to identify where we can get greater value and upgrade the portfolio. When you think about what we\u2019re actually doing and why we view this asset management program as fundamental of how we manage the business is that on the upside we have a very focused exploration program and we have a targeted inorganic program and acquisition program that\u2019s looking for opportunities that can be accretive to our investment inventory, our portfolio that upgrades the overall portfolio. And you think about things like Guyana and Papua New Guinea and the Jurong Aromatics and Mozambique assets. We\u2019ve bought a lot of stuff at the very top of the portfolio. And concurrent with that, we\u2019re looking at the bottom of the portfolio of things that don\u2019t compete, assets that are late in life and we don\u2019t see material upside and that\u2019s what really sources our ongoing divestment program.", "Roger Read", "No, it\u2019s helpful. I\u2019m just interested if maybe with the churn in terms of new opportunities if that would increase sort of the churn or whatever on the mature scale of things. But it\u2019s helpful and we\u2019ll see you next month.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Thanks, Roger.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Blake Fernandez with Scotia Howard Weil.", "Blake Fernandez", "Hi, Jeff. Good morning. I\u2019ll just use both my questions fairly straightforward on CapEx. For one, I just wanted to go back to 2017. I think the $23 billion number was about $1 billion above your original guidance. And I\u2019m just trying to understand the delta there. Was that kind of activity-based or more inflation than you were expecting or maybe more M&A dollars?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes, Blake, it was really the last. So if you think about the 23 billion, we had a number of break-ins, but I want to make sure everybody understands that those break-ins were highly accretive to overall financial performance. And as a result, it pushed us up. But if you think just like in the Brazil acquisitions that we picked up, the bid prices in Jurong Aromatics, they both increased the CapEx well above what our plans were and the organization was able to absorb a majority of that through our ongoing blocking and tackling with capital efficiency improvements. There was some reprioritization of some capital plans. But I think the message I want to keep on emphasizing is, is that we have a robust opportunity in inventory of high-quality investments that we think will continue to grow materially long-term value for our shareholders. And as long as we\u2019ve got such a strong inventory investment opportunity, we\u2019re going to continue pursuing. And we\u2019ve taken a full advantage of the down cycle in the market to capture some very attractive assets that are going to upgrade our portfolio.", "Blake Fernandez", "Understood. I guess tying in with that, and this maybe goes back to Neil\u2019s question, but just to understand. It seems like there\u2019s a little bit of a shift in that. I guess your original guidance of 22 billion for '17 contemplated some form of M&A obviously, but now it sounds like going into '18, the 24 billion basically does not. So aside from the Brazil piece of it, I guess should we be thinking that any kind of M&A activity would be additive to that 24 billion? Just looking to confirm that.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes. So 2017 \u2013 to your point just to be clear, 2017 included although we didn\u2019t advertise at the time, it included the Mozambique acquisition. On top of that, we picked up a number of additional opportunities as I said, Brazil and Jurong Aromatics. As you think about 2018, we always leave a little flexibility in our budget in order to pursue those type of opportunities. You want to make sure that you give yourself some room to go ahead and try to capture those opportunities when they come about. Fundamentally, we\u2019ll go leverage our strong financial capability and balance sheet if something really big comes along and we think it\u2019s going to be accretive for the shareholder. But going forward in the 2018 program, the only thing that is specific, that\u2019s public is the Brazil payment for the farm-in into North Carcara which is round numbers, about $1.3 billion.", "Blake Fernandez", "Understood. Thank you.", "Jeff Woodbury", "All right.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jason Gammel with Jefferies.", "Jason Gammel", "Thanks. Hi, Jeff. Jeff, you\u2019ve been absent from Brazilian Upstream for a number of years and now a pretty massive shift all at one time into exploration development potential and strategic lines with Petrobras. Can you talk about anything that may have changed in your thoughts around Brazil or is this purely a lot of opportunities just coming up at the same time? And I\u2019ll just ask my second question at the same time. You\u2019ve also picked up a lot of other deepwater exploration acreage just over the last six months or so in Guyana and Mauritania and Ghana. Can you talk about how you\u2019re looking in general at deepwater now competing on the global cost curve?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Sure. On the first one, Jason, in Brazil and I\u2019ll certainly acknowledge that we\u2019ve been absent \u2013 largely absent from Brazil where \u2013 I think we would all recognize has a very strong and rich resource endowment. One of the issues for us over the time, Jason, was that we\u2019re going to invest where we believe the investment dollars are globally competitive. And as Brazil continued to evolve the fiscal reforms, it got to a point where the opportunity coupled with the changes in their reforms made it more attractive for us. And particularly if you think about some of the pre-salt acreage that we picked up, unlike some of the earlier bids, the acreage that we\u2019ve got is covered by a concession contract and not a production sharing contract which just provides a better risk reward balance. So very pleased about the way Brazil has developed and progressed and we think we\u2019ve got a very strong position there now. And as I alluded to previously, we\u2019re going to be very focused to getting after it. The second question is the acreage that we had picked up around the world. It\u2019s fairly obvious to everyone. We\u2019re picking up additional exploration potential. Think about it this way. In terms of how we focus our exploration pursuits, it\u2019s primarily in two key areas. One is where we can get into new play opening opportunities that we see a very high quality potential resource that would compete with global investment opportunities that we believe has a very \u2013 assuming we achieve the objectives of the exploration program, we\u2019ll have a clear path to profitability relative to our other investment opportunities in the portfolio. The second area is where we have existing infrastructure and we see significant high quality potential that we can bring on and start generating revenue pretty quick. When you think about some of the deepwater areas that we\u2019re in, Guyana is a great example. While we\u2019ve had that acreage for a while, some of our technology that we\u2019ve applied to sub-surface imaging has really positioned us well to see things that others historically had not seen there. And you\u2019ve seen the result. We\u2019ve got six very substantial discoveries there and the economics are very robust. At a $40 flat rail, we\u2019re talking about double digit returns. The cost of supply for Guyana is very low. And I think we are \u2013 as with our partners are very well positioned to capitalize on it and we\u2019re leveraging our global deepwater capabilities in doing so. But the same is true in some of these other areas in West Africa, in Cyprus, we\u2019re looking at resources that could be very much on the low side of the cost of supply curve and can compete in a global view that maybe long on supply for a period of time.", "Jason Gammel", "Thanks, Jeff. I appreciate the thoughts.", "Jeff Woodbury", "All right, Jason.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Biraj Borkhataria from Royal Bank of Canada.", "Biraj Borkhataria", "Hi, Jeff. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just had one question. On CapEx, obviously you\u2019re increasing investment in the U.S. Could you talk a little bit about the projects which are effectively or the regions are losing competitiveness internally or moving down the priority list? I see the impairments you\u2019ve taken are partly \u2013 it looks like Canadian gas is one of the losers within your portfolio and the impairment shows that. But any color around projects that aren\u2019t going to have less capital going forward will be helpful.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Biraj, I wouldn\u2019t call any area losers. You can think \u2013 rewind back over a decade and we were \u2013 the industry generally view that the U.S. was going to be declining in terms of energy supplies. And you look at \u2013 fast forward to today and look at the abundance that we\u2019ve got. And it\u2019s very relevant to the example that you just highlighted what\u2019s really happened with these non-producing assets within Canada. Well, they\u2019ve become less and less competitive as technology and learning curve benefits have continued to increase substantially the quality and quantity of unconventional resources in the U.S. So as a result we find ourselves in a circumstance where once again technology is going to continue to open up opportunities. So while there may be over certain periods of time maybe areas where you see resource potential or investment dollars declining, I just never short the full potential of technology and what it can bring to additional investment opportunities. As we were just talking per Jason\u2019s question, you see that we\u2019ve got a lot of exploration focus in some of these deepwater areas. Again, we\u2019re trying to fully leverage the full capability of Exxon Mobil\u2019s unique strengths in doing so. But we keep a brief across the whole global portfolio to see if there is anything new that\u2019s coming up. And you\u2019ve seen us going to some places after many years of absence and being very successful there.", "Biraj Borkhataria", "Thank you. That\u2019s helpful.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays.", "Paul Cheng", "Hi, guys. Good morning.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Good morning, Paul.", "Paul Cheng", "Jeff, a number of real quick questions. Do you have any \u2013 what\u2019s the asset sales gain in the quarter and in what segment or regions?", "Jeff Woodbury", "So let me start with \u2013 per the press release, the total proceeds in the quarter was $1.4 billion. And most of that, Paul, I\u2019d say about two-thirds of that was in the Upstream, the rest in the Downstream. And I really highlighted what that was in my previous comments. The Upstream is driven by our divestment of our operated assets in Norway, Downstream being driven by the divestment of our retail assets in Norway. If you look at earnings, in the quarter itself, it was just shy of \u2013 it\u2019s about $540 million. Again, primarily split between the Upstream and the Downstream.", "Paul Cheng", "Is it also two-thirds, one-third in terms of earnings?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Well balanced. It\u2019s probably 60/40 Upstream/Downstream.", "Paul Cheng", "Okay, 60/40. And just want to clarify. The Mozambique acquisition, the $2.8 billion, is that in 2017? Does that mean that it closed before the year or it closed after the year-end?", "Jeff Woodbury", "It closed before the year-end.", "Paul Cheng", "Before the year-end, okay.", "Jeff Woodbury", "It\u2019s in the 2017 results.", "Paul Cheng", "Okay. And just curious that for Bakken, you drilled the three-mile \u2013 not exactly three-mile, I think 12,000-feet lateral well. Have you completed or brought that on stream that have any production data?", "Jeff Woodbury", "For the three-mile laterals?", "Paul Cheng", "Yes. ", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes, we don\u2019t have anything sure at this point. We have brought it on stream. They\u2019re working through facility constraints for the facility \u2013 for that region. And I think we\u2019ve got two of the four wells now that are on production but \u2013 like I said, it\u2019s still very early days right now. But I will tell you that they\u2019ve met our pre-drill expectations.", "Paul Cheng", "Jeff, can you tell us that when did they come on stream or how long you already have the data?", "Jeff Woodbury", "It\u2019s not very long, Paul. We\u2019re talking about months. And as I said earlier, we also had this weather downtime notably up in the Bakken.", "Paul Cheng", "Okay. And for the $24 billion on the 2018 CapEx, can you tell us how much is associated with the equity of Eni?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Sorry, the equity of what now?", "Paul Cheng", "The equity of Eni, the non-consulting subsidiaries, because the 24 billion is your total rate including the consulting operation --", "Jeff Woodbury", "You\u2019re talking for Mozambique?", "Paul Cheng", "No. I\u2019m saying that in 2018, you\u2019re CapEx of $24 billion, how much --", "Jeff Woodbury", "How much is equity companies?", "Paul Cheng", "Yes, equity companies.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes, Paul, we don\u2019t break that out.", "Paul Cheng", "All right, will do. Thank you.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Thanks, Paul.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Alistair Syme from Citi.", "Alastair Syme", "Thanks very much. Just a very quick one, Jeff. Can you just explain on the impairments, taking both U.S. and international, I think you said in 3Q that you were revising the oil and gas prices. So I just wanted to clarify what that change was.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes, so I talked about it a bit earlier when \u2013 first of all when we go through the process, it really starts through our business planning process, which includes a look at long-term supply and demand and in our planning process, if there\u2019s anything that we see that is a fundamental change that will cause us to do a deeper dive. But one of the things that we have continued to see as a trend has been the substantial growth in commercial resources within the unconventional or within North America and the significant commensurate with that, a significant reduction in the cost of supply. And as a result, when you think about that and the impact it\u2019s going to have longer term, it\u2019s likely to depress longer term gas prices. Now kind of the flipside of all that is, one, that reduces the cost of energy. Also, that technology has, as I said, driven down the cost side of it. So it\u2019s a matter of making sure that you\u2019re pursuing the most competitive assets. And then when you think about some of these Canadian assets I referenced, they just don\u2019t compete like they used to at this point. And as a result, we took the decision not to progress any more development planning activity and write them off.", "Alastair Syme", "Okay. Thank you for clarifying.", "Jeff Woodbury", "You bet.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Theepan Jothilingam with Exane BNP.", "Theepan Jothilingam", "Hi. Good morning, Jeff. Two quick questions. Firstly, just in terms of coming back to the cash flow number for the quarter, just objectively, are there any particular sort of one-offs or seasonal factors? I know it\u2019s difficult just to extrapolate one quarter into sort of annual performance but I just want to know if there was any sort of cash taxes that were higher than a typical quarter or not. Second question, you\u2019re growing that retail business in Mexico. I just want to understand where you think the position can get to or what are the ambitions for Exxon in Mexico in the Downstream? Thank you.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Theepan, there\u2019s really nothing that is mentionable with respect to our cash flow in the quarter itself other than these kind of one-offs that were \u2013 and it\u2019s an accumulation of a bunch of one-off, other earnings events that had a negative impact on earnings and therefore cash flow as well. But I will be the first to admit. Those happen throughout the year as well. So there\u2019s nothing that I would point to, other than the impact from the tax reform that had the effects that we\u2019ve already talked about on the other balance sheet items that I would be able to talk to.", "Theepan Jothilingam", "Okay.", "Jeff Woodbury", "On Mexico, we went ahead and, I believe in the fourth quarter, we opened eight Mobil branded stations. We\u2019ve got plans to go ahead and open up another 50 sites by the end of the first quarter. I think it\u2019s important that Exxon Mobil is participating in Mexico on an integrated basis using our global refining capacity to supply the Mexican fuel demand. I believe we did announce that we\u2019ve got plans to invest about $300 million in logistics, product inventories, and marketing over the next decade. But I think it provides another good opportunity and outlet for our refined products.", "Theepan Jothilingam", "Okay. Thanks very much, Jeff. See you next month.", "Jeff Woodbury", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.", "Pavel Molchanov", "Hi, guys. Just one from me. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been touched on yet. A lot of headlines over the last 10 days or so regarding the Groningen field. And I wanted to get your understanding of what the JV will be able to produce at Groningen in the course of 2018 beyond the output cap that went into effect this past October.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes. Well, right now, as you know, NAM, which is the operator, is continuing to operate under the current cap at 21.6 cubic meters. We clearly understand the concerns of the people that are experiencing these tremors and the related damage. We respect the government\u2019s efforts to go in and address valid concerns. In terms of how NAM will respond to that, it\u2019s really \u2013 they\u2019re probably best to go ahead and address the matter. We continue to provide technical support to them. But I think if the cap, the current 21.6 stays in effect through the full year, Pavel, it would impact our 2018 volumes by about 40 million cubic feet a day lower than 2017. But, of course, as you probably saw on the recent announcement, the government is thinking about modifying that.", "Pavel Molchanov", "Okay, clear enough. Appreciate it.", "Jeff Woodbury", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rob West with Redburn.", "Rob West", "Hi. Thanks, Jeff. There\u2019s two shorter term questions I wanted to ask you. The first one is thank you for the breakdown of the production effects between divestments and PSCs and decline. I was wondering on the decline component, can you touch on whether the assets, particularly Africa and Asia, the weaker areas, are seeing any decline that\u2019s above the level you\u2019d expected or in line? And that is in the context of I think some of your peers are seeing lower declines generally because of digitization and reliability drives, because I was wondering where you were on that. That\u2019s my first one.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes, Rob, it\u2019s a great question because we monitor that very closely. And I\u2019d say, by and large, over the last year we\u2019ve been able to mitigate some of the natural field decline in a number of fields through very solid reservoir management, artificial lift improvement, changes to how we manage the assets, reliability. But, by and large, we\u2019ve managed that very well and been able to offset those declines. So nothing in excess of what we would expect at this point.", "Rob West", "Okay. That sounds like good news. On the second question, back to what Brendan was asking about on the Chemical side, the long-term view is clear. I was wondering more on the short term. I guess what we\u2019ve got, particularly in the U.S., is quite a large number of start-ups really bunched together quite quickly. And I hear you on the long term of the market but particularly this quarter, you had big growth in volumes and with that, a slight weakening of margins. Do you see any short-term margin impacts as those big volumes ramp up? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of that prior comment you made, whether it\u2019s a long-term comment or whether we should brace for some short-term margin impacts as the ramp-ups come?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Well, Rob, there\u2019s always the possibility of short-term volatility. No doubt about it. I mean, if you think about \u2013 break it down to some elements, the olefins, polyolefins, demand growth has been very robust. But there are going to be some capacity start-ups here over the next two years or so that could have some implications. But what you\u2019ve got to do is you\u2019ve got to have the lowest cost of operation and you have to have a very high-value and appreciated product to sell. And if you look at our metallocene product sales, we\u2019ve been growing at a much greater escalation than the demand growth for chemicals. But each one of these products, we pay very close attention to it. And our investment premise has primarily been based on our long-term expectation in terms of growth. And then you build the portfolio to be robust by lowering your feedstock flexibility, taking full advantage \u2013 for Exxon Mobil, taking full advantage of the lower cost structure from the integration between our chemical and our refining operations. And then, as I said, fully leverage our technology in order to provide a high-value product that the market appreciates and has a pull on.", "Rob West", "Okay, great. Thank you. Look forward to asking some long-term ones at the strategy update.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Herrlin from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.", "John Herrlin", "Yes, just two quick ones. With Liza Phase 2, are you going to own the FPSO or lease?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes, John, that\u2019s to be determined.", "John Herrlin", "Okay, that\u2019s fine. And then with respect to the horizontal wells in the Midland, three-mile wells take a while to clean up. Can you give us a sense of how long it does take to clean up a well that long?", "Jeff Woodbury", "Yes, I really don\u2019t have anything to share at this point. It\u2019s still pretty early days on the start-up for these wells. I know there\u2019s a lot of interest as a result of us pushing further and further out. But I will tell you that all of the technical work that we have done, the modeling, et cetera, in order to justify the incremental value proposition that we\u2019re to get from these longer laterals that these wells so far are performing as expected, in terms of execution and initial rates. But when we get to the point where we\u2019ve got some good data that we feel like is appropriate, we\u2019ll go ahead and share it at that point.", "John Herrlin", "Okay. Thank you.", "Jeff Woodbury", "You\u2019re welcome, John.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Woodbury for any additional or closing remarks.", "Jeff Woodbury", "Well, as always, I really do appreciate your interest, your engagement, and your very thoughtful questions. And as I noted earlier that we\u2019re looking forward to having a good conversation next month at our Analyst Meeting. And we do have in sights a very aggressive plan to drive our value growth and intend to give more clarity around what that looks like, in terms of what it is, how we\u2019re going to do it, and why it is important to the corporation and to our shareholders. So, again, I appreciate your interest and we look forward to seeing you next month.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference.
