At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.", "And I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Sujal Shah. Please go ahead, sir.", "Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's second-quarter 2017 results. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Terrence Curtin; and Chief Financial Officer, Heath Mitts.", "During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning. We ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items.", "The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com.", "Now, let me turn the call over to Terrence for opening comments.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thanks, Sujal, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for the earnings call. While many of you know me well, it's very exciting to me holding my first earnings call as CEO and sharing our strong results for the second quarter as well as an improved growth and earnings outlook for the year.", "In the second quarter, we delivered sales of $3.2 billion, representing 8% organic growth year-over-year, and we experienced growth across all regions. We delivered record quarter two profitability, with 170 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year-over-year and adjusted earnings per share of $1.19, which was up 32% over the prior year.", "Now, this second-quarter performance was ahead of our prior guidance due to the higher organic growth as well as strong execution by our teams. All of our segments contributed to our sales growth and margin expansion was driven by our Industrial and Communications segments.", "Based upon these strong results and our view of market conditions for the second half, we are raising the midpoint of our revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance to $12.7 billion and $4.62, representing 6% organic revenue growth and 17% earnings per share growth, respectively.", "I do want to take a moment to reiterate the key pillars of our strategy that we've had discussed within the past. First is our focus on harsh environment applications, which demand high levels of engineering and manufacturing in excellence and provide competitive differentiation.", "Second is our TEOA operating system that drives the customer service enhancements and productivity that reduces our fixed cost footprint. And third is our consistent execution of our balanced capital allocation strategy, which enabled us to make strategic acquisitions that have expanded our portfolio, while consistently increasing dividends and repurchasing our shares.", "Also in addition to these three, we are also focused on ensuring that we align and enable our teams around the world to be focused in executing towards these pillars. With our portfolio focused on the harsh environments, I'm pleased that our business is now firing on all cylinders with revenue and profitability growth across each of our segments.", "Our second-quarter performance and increase guidance for fiscal 2017 demonstrate successful execution on our strategy and we believe this foundation will continue to drive growth ahead of our markets, deliver improved financial performance and generate strong returns for our owners.", "If you could, please turn to slide 3 to review some additional highlights from the second quarter. As I indicated, we have growth across all segments of regions with particular strength in Asia, where our organic growth was 16%.", "We delivered 10% organic growth in our Transportation segment, with auto and commercial transportation driving significant performance above-market growth rates due to content gains. In Industrial Solutions, markets are improving and we generated 3% organic growth, that was in line with our prior guidance for the segment. And in the Communications segment, sales increased 9% organically with growth across each of our three business units.", "At the company level, adjusted operating margins were 16.6% with year-over-year expansion driven by the Industrial and Communications segments.", "As we look forward to guidance, we're raising our organic growth expectations from 4% to 6% for the year, with second-half growth expected across all segments year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share, we're raising from $4.40 to $4.62 at the midpoint, reflecting higher growth and a slightly lower tax rate.", "Heath and I will go through the details on the guidance later in the call, but as you think about our revenue guidance increase, please keep in mind that we have stronger-than-expected second quarter and this outperformance explains about half of the full-year increase.", "We're also seeing a strong momentum in orders, which reinforces slightly higher growth expectations for the second half in our commercial transportation business and our Communications segment, along with a slightly reduced headwind from add-backs versus our prior guidance view.", "Before we get into the segment results and updates, I appreciate if you could turn to slide 4, so I can cover our orders for the quarter, which will help provide context for the trends that we're seeing and our expectations.", "Demonstrating continued momentum, our total orders were $3.4 billion in the second quarter and if you exclude SubCom, which is what has shown on the slide, orders were $3.2 billion, which were up 16% year-over-year and up 15% organically. We saw organic order growth across all of our segments in the second quarter as well as growth among all our regions. By region and excluding SubCom, orders in the Americas grew 14%; in Europe, they grew 13%; and in Asia, they grew 18%.", "As we want to remind you that these growth rates are somewhat amplified due to a relatively weaker comparison versus last year's second quarter when we're contending with both inventory corrections and certain regional weaknesses.", "By segment in Transportation, orders increased 17%, with growth in all regions. Industrial orders grew 22% year-over-year due to the Creganna and Intercontec acquisitions, while orders organically were up 8%.", "In the Communications segment, excluding SubCom, we saw year-over-year organic orders growth of 17%, including 9% growth in Data and Devices, that's from our high-speed connectivity focus, as well as Appliance orders grew 27% organically, reflecting continued strength and share gain in Asia. When you look at our sequential orders growth in Industrial and Communications, both of these support our growth outlook in the second half.", "So, please turn to slide 5, so I can discuss the segment results and I'll start with our Transportation segment. Quarter two was a very strong quarter for Transportation, with sales growing 10% organically year-over-year and operating margins in the range of our expected levels. Segment sales exceeded expectations due to auto demand in China, where we saw another quarter of production growth versus the prior year and growth from our leading position in the heavy truck market.", "Our Auto sales were up 9% organically due to growth in Asia and in Europe and auto production growth, we estimate, was up approximately 4% in the quarter and we continue to outperform the market due to content growth and share gains.", "For the full year, we expect global auto production to be up 2% to 3% based upon the stronger-than-expected first-half production. With the strong production that we experienced in the first half, we expect the estimated growth for the year from a production perspective really to be driven by the first-half production growth.", "Looking at the second half, it pretty much implies a flat to 1% production growth in the second half, which is what we expected when we started the year and we expect the production growth to moderate and really has not changed from our prior guidance.", "Turning to commercial transportation, our business delivered another very strong quarter, as this business continued to outperform the market. Organic revenue growth grew 21%, driven by our strong global position, strength in the heavy truck market in China and content growth due to adoption of new emission standards and regulations.", "In our Sensors business, we had 3% growth organically with growth driven by Transportation and getting the benefit of improving Industrial markets. Adjusted operating margin for the segment remained strong at 19% and was where we expected. And we continue to support a robust pipeline of design wins that will generate future growth above production. As we've have indicated to you before, you should continue to think of a steady-state Transportation operating margin as 20%, plus or minus a point.", "If you could, please turn to page 6 to discuss our Industrial Solutions segment. Sales in this segment grew 16% on a reported basis, driven by Creganna and the Intercontec acquisitions, and 3% on an organic basis, which was in line with our expectations.", "We are very pleased with the growth and performance of our acquisitions and they're contributing favorably to the segment, both on the top and bottom line. In industrial equipment, we grew 4% organically, with increased demand from factory automation applications and we're seeing the benefit of that in all regions.", "In our aerospace and defense unit, our defense business grew organically, while our commercial air was negatively impacted by timing of programs in the quarter. Our oil and gas business has now stabilized and is no longer expected to be a headwind to revenue or operating margins on a year-over-year basis.", "Our energy business grew 7% organically, driven by strength both in Europe as well as in Asia. Adjusted operating margins for this segment increased 130 basis points to 12.7% as we expected, and we believe operating margins will expand from this level in the second half with the revenue growth. To help show the progress, excluding the impact from the acquisition-related amortization, adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 160 basis points to 16.9%.", "So, please turn to page 7, so I can cover Communications Solutions. The second quarter really demonstrates the progress that we've made in this segment. We had 9% organic growth and continued momentum in all three businesses.", "Segment adjusted operating margins expanded significantly year-over-year and improved versus last quarter and now they're at 15.2%. Data and Devices reported another quarter of organic growth as we continue to benefit from the high-speed ramps at cloud infrastructure customers.", "As we discussed last quarter, growth in this business is the result of our multi-year transformation to focus the product portfolio on key growth applications, and we expect organic growth for the full year.", "In addition, D&D more than doubled its adjusted operating margin from a year ago, driving significant improvement at the segment level as the actions taken to transform the portfolio and optimize the operations have really taken hold.", "In our Appliance business, we have very strong performance of 14% organic growth year-over-year as demand remained strong, particularly in Asia. And our SubCom business grew 11% in the second quarter.", "Adjusted operating margins of 15.2% were up 680 basis points from the prior year with contributions from all businesses and actually was up 200 basis points sequentially.", "So, with that segment overview, I'll turn it over to Heath, who'll cover the financials.", "Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thank you, Terrence, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide 8, where I will provide more details on the Q2 financials. Adjusted operating income was $535 million with an adjusted operating margin of 16.6%, driven by strong organic growth of 8% and productivity benefits.", "GAAP operating income was $473 million and included $59 million of restructuring charges and $3 million of acquisition-related charges. For the full year, we continue to expect restructuring charges of approximately $150 million, driven by footprint consolidations from acquisitions and structural improvements.", "We aim to strike a healthy balance between investing for future growth while capturing SG&A efficiencies. GAAP EPS was $1.13 for the quarter. Adjusted EPS was a new record for the second quarter at $1.19, up 32% year-on-year. This was above our prior guidance range driven by revenue growth and the benefit from a lower tax rate.", "The growth above the prior year is a result of our strategy in action with harsh applications driving growth, TEOA driving efficiency and balanced capital deployment enabling acquisitions and share buyback.", "We also benefited from a lower adjusted effective tax rate of 15.4% driven by the expirations of statutes in certain jurisdictions and additional benefits from Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 related to stock compensation. For the full year, I now expect an adjusted effective tax rate around 18%, which is similar to last year.", "However, as discussed last quarter, please keep in mind that the year-over-year dynamics. We get an EPS benefit in the first half of 2017 and have an EPS headwind in the second half of 2017 given that our Q3 2016 and Q4 2016 adjusted effective tax rates were 17% and 13%, respectively.", "While the first half benefit is $0.10, you have a negative impact of $0.10 in the second half, resulting in a zero net impact for the year. Going forward, I would expect an adjusted effective tax rate between 19% and 20%. Page 15 of our slide deck contains a bridge that provides the details for the first half and second half.", "Turning to slide 9; our strong Q2 results demonstrate that we are executing on our strategy and performing well against our business model. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 34.4%, a 180-basis-point improvement from prior year, driven by fall-through on increased volumes, productivity improvements from our TEOA programs and restructuring benefits.", "Adjusted operating margins were 16.6% in the quarter, up 170 basis points year-over-year driven by our Industrial and Communications segments. Adjusted EBITDA helps explain the cash earnings on our business. Adjusted EBITDA margins in Q2 were 21.3%, up 160 basis points year-on-year.", "Cash from continuing operations was $521 million, and free cash flow was $387 million in the quarter. Free cash flow grew year-over-year, primarily due to the better operational performance. We returned $234 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the quarter.", "Looking ahead, we continue to expect free cash to approximate net income and capital expenditures to be approximately 5% of sales. We remain committed to our disciplined long-term capital strategy for balanced return of free cash flow to shareholders, while still having ample capital to invest for acquisitions.", "Our balance sheet is strong, with reasonable debt levels and an ability to continue to support return of capital and acquisitions going forward. We have added a balance sheet and cash flow summary in the appendix for additional details.", "Now, I'll turn the call back to Terrence.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thanks, Heath. And let me cover our guidance for both the third quarter and full year. So let's start with the third quarter. And if you could look at slide 10, please.", "We expect third quarter revenue of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.14 to $1.18 per share. This represents reported sales growth of 4% and organic sales growth of 5%, with 7% adjusted EPS growth at the midpoint.", "I do want to highlight that our outlook includes the negative impact of the stronger dollar, which we expect will be a headwind of $70 million to sales and $0.04 to EPS on a year-over-year basis. And in addition, as Heath mentioned, there is a unfavorable tax impact of 3 years (sic) [$0.03] when you compare it to the prior year.", "Without these two headwinds, we would expect solid double-digit earnings per share growth year-over-year on 5% organic revenue growth, which is in line with our business model.", "Looking by segment, we expect Transportation Solutions to grow low single digits on a reported basis and mid single digits organically. This is above the expected auto production growth levels of 1% that we expect in the third quarter, with our outperformance being driven by content growth. We also expect continued growth in our commercial transportation segment across all regions.", "In Industrial Solutions, we continue to expect to grow low single digits on both a reported and organic basis, with growth expected across all three of our business units.", "And in Communications, we expect high single-digit growth on both a reported and on an organic basis, with growth in each of our three businesses. We do expect SubCom to be particularly strong in the third quarter due to the timing of program executions.", "Now let's move to slide 11 so I can cover full-year guidance. And just before I get in the guidance, as I said earlier, I'm very pleased that our business is firing on all cylinders, with revenue growth and operating margin expansion this year being driven by all three segments. And as we look at the second half, the margin expansion that we're going to experience in the second half will be driven by the Communications and Industrial segments. It's very similar to what we saw in quarter two.", "So, when you look at our guidance for the year, we are raising the midpoint of revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance from our prior view by $300 million on the top-line and $0.22. Roughly $100 million of the sales increase and $0.04 of the earnings per share improvement is from reduced currency exchange headwinds.", "Organic revenue expectations were increasing from 4% to 6% or roughly $200 million. Of this, approximately, $130 million is from the outperformance we had in the second quarter, and $70 million is driven by higher outlook in both our Commercial Transportation business and the Communications segment in the second half.", "I do want to note that our assumption for Auto growth in the second half has not changed from our prior view. We expect our Auto business to deliver mid-single digits growth in the second half on a slight production increase.", "When you look at our implied year-over-year trends in the first half to second half, I would ask you to keep in mind the impact of currency exchange rates and the tax dynamics that Heath talked about and then we have more details on slide 15 of the deck.", "For the full year, the increase I just walked you through results in revenue in the range of $12.6 billion to $12.8 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $4.58 to $4.66. This represents 6% reported and organic growth and 17% adjusted EPS growth at the midpoint versus the 52 weeks of fiscal 2016.", "By segment, we expect Transportation Solutions to now be up high-single digits organically, reflecting strong results in the first half and continued content growth and share gains. As I said, while we continue to expect auto production to moderate, we expect to generate mid-single-digit revenue growth in our Auto business in the second half.", "Commercial Transportation is expected to outperform its end market again this year, benefiting from content expansion in the heavy truck market. And we expect our Sensors business to grow mid-single digits year-over-year.", "In our Industrial segment, organic growth guidance is consistent with the guidance we've been giving since the start of the year, reflecting continued improvement in the industrial markets.", "And in Communications, we expect to be up low single digits on a reported basis, an improvement versus our prior year, reflecting selecting continued strength in Appliances and growth in Data and Devices. And we're raising our guidance for our SubCom unit to high-single-digit growth this year.", "In summary, I feel very good about our ability to drive 6% organic growth, and expand our operating margins and generate strong double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth this year. I think this demonstrates that our portfolio is delivering and continuing to benefit from the secular trend of content growth across our businesses.", "Before we go to Q&A, I do want to close by thanking our employees for the strong execution in the second quarter as well as their continued commitment to bring our technologies to our customers all around the world.", "So, with that, let's open it up to questions, Sujal.", "Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Okay, Brad, could you give the instructions for the Q&A session?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Sure. And our first question today comes from the line of Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.", "Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC", "Hi. Morning, everyone, and congrats on the good first half of the year.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thanks, Shawn.", "Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC", "This is the obvious question on Auto, but you have had some other players into the markets raise some red flags, be it excess inventory in North America, China production declining. And I know your fiscal year doesn't align with the other calendar year-ends of many companies. But are you seeing any weakness in auto production out there right now, be a kind of flattish second half that would lead you worried into the next fiscal year?", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Hey, Shawn, it's Terrence. So let me take that question. When you look at Auto this year and we go back to the beginning of the year, we expected North America to be flat to slightly down in production and it's sort of playing out as we expected. I think when you look at Europe, we've actually seen a Europe that has constructively gotten better throughout the year, incrementally. So not major movement, I would say, continued strength and it has been a positive trend.", "And the same holds true in Asia, outside of China. When we guided in the beginning of the year and we guided to 1% growth overall, it was really the big wildcard was around the China incentive and what would be the impact once that incentive tailed off. And we always assumed that auto production was going to be pretty much flat in the second half and it looks like it's playing out that way.", "And so while we had a strong first half in production and a lot of it was driven by China, as we're looking at order rates, we view the year is playing out as we sort of said all year, with the only real change being China production was a little stronger in the first half, which really has driven the increase from our original 1% production growth up to the 2% to 3%.", "The other thing, I said on the call, we always also view the \u2013 even in that low production growth environment we were going to get into in the second half, we felt very good with our content wins that we were going to drive mid single-digit growth and that hasn't changed at all. So when you think through our guidance and the changes we're making in the guidance, our Auto has been pretty consistent with the picture that we said, and we expect the China auto to slow and we expected a tough North American market, it's been tough in North America now almost for two years when you sort of look at the production environment, it's been sort of flat to slightly down. So I don't think there is incremental red flag. I think it's playing out as we thought.", "Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC", "That's very helpful. And then secondly, just following up on the SubCom business now being up high single digits for the year, maybe you could talk about what visibility you have into fiscal 2018? Does the business decline, can you hold it flattish into fiscal 2018 based upon the backlog you have right now?", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Shawn, thanks for that question. Well, SubCom, we always talk to you about SubCom and we have a pretty good 18-month window based upon the projects in the pipeline, and what was nice during the quarter, our backlog is still pretty steady at around $850 million is what we have booked, and we're also working on a number of opportunities that we're quoting.", "So I think when you look at where we are right now, the strength of the backlog, I would sort of assume as you model next year, keep SubCom pretty much flat with where we guided for this year. And like we normally do, we get more projects and we'll update as confidence increases, but I think the confidence we have is the amount of activity that we're quoting and working on, and I think modeling sort of a flat off this number we're giving you for this year is probably the most prudent thing to do right now.", "Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC", "Thanks so much.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thank you.", "Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thank you, Shawn. Could we have the next question please?", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys. I guess two questions from me as well, on the Transportation side, could you maybe talk about the operating margin dynamics you saw on a sequential basis. I think it was down about 300 basis points. Could you just touch on what kind of happened over there and how do you think of margins as you go through fiscal 2017 broadly and when do you see the center headwind, which I think it is a big issue for you guys right now, abating?", "Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Amit, this is Heath. I'll take that. I think if you go back and look at our comments from 90 days ago, we were pretty clear that the Transportation segment margins were running very hot and are not really sustainable.", "So I think internally, when we looked at the 19% it was right in line with where we thought it would come in and consistent with where we've guided in terms of 20% plus or minus. There is some investment activity going on in the segment, as we're ramping up, because our revenue pipeline is very strong in Transportation globally.", "So we're going to continue to make those investments, and I think modeling plus or minus 20% is probably a good number for that. Sensors is improving, you see the organic growth in terms of their \u2013 it still continues to be a bit of a headwind relative to the overall segment margins, but it is progressing on track with where we thought it would be this year at this point, and the outlook going forward will continue to be less of a headwind as we progress through the next couple of years.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Got it. And I guess, Heath, you talked about, I think the $150 million researching plan for the year. How much of that is just M&A integration versus implementing structural improvements within TE Connectivity's portfolio? And how should we think about the payback period for the cost take-out that you guys are doing?", "Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thanks, Amit. That's a good question. There is some acquisition-related integration, some of those tied to more recent acquisitions that have been done, even including Sensors and into the medical space. There is some of that included in there. And then quite honestly, there is some broader footprint consolidation that we're doing as well, we'll continue to move forward on as we optimize the footprint. But there is a balance there between those. And I think in general, if you want to calculate, most of our restructuring has somewhere between a 18-month, two-year payback in terms of the cash-on-cash returns.", "Some of the restructuring that you see in the $150 million, there's a chunk of that that's non-cash-related, that are write-offs. So if I think about it on a cash-on-cash return, I think two years is probably a good number.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Perfect. Thank you and congrats on the quarter, guys.", "Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thank you, Amit.", "Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thanks, Amit.", "Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Could we have the next question please?", "Operator", "And we do have a question from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen & Co. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Congrats on the quarter. I've seen several news releases highlighting some of your products and it looks like you have a pretty big booth at the upcoming LIGHTFAIR trade show. Are you trying to accelerate your penetration in the whole connected home market?", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thanks, Joe. When you look at it \u2013 LIGHTFAIR is coming up. And when you think about what we do there, around the home, I talked a little bit about our Appliance business, which we have a lot in the home. And over the past five years, we have increased investment around lighting; that would be part of our Industrial business. So it's areas where as lighting goes that we need, you get into sockets, it comes into a natural opportunity for us. I think it's just one of those applications that sort of shows where we bring our engineering to and also how it is finally engineered as we have the switch over there.", "So it is a product area we've gotten into. I don't know the revenue we have off the top of my head. But from that standpoint, I think it's pretty typical of the type of applications throughout our business we try to go after to really make sure how do we continue to outgrowth for the market. So certainly around that space, we have made investments into it.", "Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you. And then could you give us some details on what you're seeing in Data and Devices, particularly in China?", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Yeah, no, on Data and Devices, our performance was extremely strong and even slightly ahead of what we thought because, as you know, we very much repositioned the portfolio around high speed. And I think you really start to see the benefit both on the growth side as well as the margins that we felt we could the business up to. It certainly came truly in there.", "When we look in Asia in Data and Devices, we have a very strong performance in Asia. We grew double digits organically in China and we basically grew greater than that outside of China, which would include Japan and Southeast Asia. So really the traction when you look at that business has always been and continues to shift towards Asia.", "And the sales performance that you saw as well as the operating performance really have been driven by those wins that we have, while you still get infrastructure investments being made around China as well as how do they service the rest of the world. So a lot of that growth will be driven out of Asia as we go forward as well.", "Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thanks for the color.", "Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "All right. Thank you, Terrence. Could we have the next question, please?", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yes. Thanks. Can you expand a bit just on the theme of increasing automotive content, so any particular applications that are driving the content increase in fiscal 2017? And then even as you go out to 2018 maybe some of the applications you guys are excited about?", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Craig, thanks for the question. I mean it is so broad-based. It's not just applications, it's everywhere in the world. So we talk about growth being greater than production. I mean, this year every region is going to have pretty substantial growth greater than production, whether it's China, whether it's Japan, whether it's Korea, even in places like North America where production is light, we're doing better than production.", "So it's very broad-based around the world, and it comes back to those trends we talked to you about not only on the connected side where you have infotainment wins, but also were you see powertrain and emission programs that does call into where our teams can help solve the problems in the harshest environments on emission and then you continue that on the safety side.", "So it's not one application. We're very fortunate, we cover all applications in what we do, being the global leader what we are, so we're benefiting from the secular trends all around Automotive and you're seeing it with the strong performance we have that's greater than production.", "I mean, when you look at the guidance I talked about as we expect production to moderate, production being relatively flat in the second half, we're going to grow mid-single-digit, which just proves the content growth assumption we talked to you about, about 4% to 6% (35:56) price off of it. It's all across the trends; it's not just one. And it's really very good execution of how we cover our customers and enable their technology to make sure they can bring it to market.", "Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. And then as my follow-up, I wanted to focus on one of the three things you highlight in terms of focal points for the company on capital allocation. And there has been I think some discussions around maybe some increased discipline around OpEx and M&A. Just wanted to get your sense of how the approach is changing if it is, and what the implications are for that as you approach M&A versus cash returns.", "Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Craig, this is Heath. I'll take that. By no means would I suggest there's been a pivot in terms of our approach. We're going to continue to be disciplined with our deployment. The dividend strategy stays on tack; the share repurchase strategy is consistent. And we have been active in the M&A market, but it's been a tough market right now with where evaluations are. And so we'll continue to be active and push that lever. But we're going to also be disciplined about where the returns are relative to those M&A investments and make sure there are deals for our shareholders.", "Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. Thanks.", "Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Okay. Thank you, Craig. Could we have the question, please?", "Operator", "And we do have a question from the line of Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi. Yes. Thank you. Hey, Terrence, clearly, the market's worried about deceleration and auto production trends and you guys are clearly outperforming based on the content growth commentary that's implied both in your guidance and in your comments here. But can you remind us maybe what levers you might lean on, if the deceleration continues to be stronger? Say in 2018, where trough Transport margins might be. I know we're firing on all cylinders right now, but just from a risk mitigation standpoint, how should investors think about the levers that you might have at your disposal if things do end up getting a little tougher? And maybe calibrate in an environment of flat to 1%; you're growing 4%, 5%; if production were to be, say, a couple of points more negative, how that might influence your Auto growth? And I have a follow-up.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Yeah, so I think let's talk a little bit about trough, and I think if production was flat next year we would expect that we're going to grow mid-single digit. And if it would be down a little bit from that, we would be growing low-single-digit, but I think with what we've done with our content wins we realize, these are platforms that we won, they're in the backlog. This is not stuff to go get when you think about next year. So I think even in a slightly negative production environment we're going to post growth.", "So I don't really view that as a trough by any means, I really view \u2013 we would tighten up like we always do around where do we invest capital and make those trade-off decisions, but I don't view that as a free-for-all from a financial performance. We would just have to manage that.", "I think it shows where the business has come from and I think it's the expansion around content, and everywhere in the world. So I think similar to this year where early in the year we told you we thought production was going to be 1%, we could grow mid-single digits. We're doing that in second half, certainly got some benefit.", "But I think the way that we're positioned as well as where we see the trends, we do expect that global auto production long term should mirror GDP. So certainly we get into elements that maybe there are, somebody has a peak in the country or a region and adjust. But I think the content trend that we have and I'll go back to what I said, again, with Craig, the trends that happen around connecting the car from an infotainment perspective, the continued safety applications and probably the bigger one always has to be around the powertrain, what happens on from emissions and what happens in those environments, whether it be electrification of the vehicle, but when there's need, that's content benefit for us. Or even if you're adding turbochargers to get better fuel economy on a smaller engine.", "That is where we thrive and that drives our engineers to create the most value, the toughest engineering challenges. And I feel very strong that we're going to continue to drive that content growth. And I think this year truly demonstrates that.", "So I think when you think through is production a little worse, I think you're still going to have, even in a slight production decline, we're going to be growing due to our content position that we have established that over the past five years.", "Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "No, that's very clear, Terrence. Thanks for that color. And as a follow-up can I just ask, we've heard of a pickup in restock activity in the channel, any comment on inventory levels, sort of non-auto inventory levels that you might have seen and could you address the discrepancy between sort of what you are including SubCom order pattern versus the guide? Thank you.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Yes. So it's a great question. So let me take the first half of your question without Automotive and without SubCom, because we have seen a couple things, we have seen our channel partners increase their ordering levels. I would tell you from inventory that are in the indirect channels, it's actually, has not moved. So it isn't like inventory is building. But what we have seen through our channel partners is that they have seen some shortages in certain other electronic components in sort of the semi side. You see them getting a little bit more aggressive in their ordering patterns. And we experienced that in our second quarter.", "In some cases those orders were placed out. We've discounted that in the guidance that we've given you in the third and fourth quarter. But certainly, we did see an acceleration of orders through our channel partners in the second quarter, which is typically a good indicator. It isn't like their inventory is getting ahead of themselves. But I think it does sort of show, just positive momentum, where they are starting to pulls. And so I think in some parts of the electronic supply chain there are some shortages that they're also trying to be cautious on. So we're monitoring that, and we'll continue to update you on that.", "Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, Terrence.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thanks, Wamsi. Good question.", "Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thanks, Wamsi, could we have the next question please?", "Operator", "We do have a question from the line of William Stein from SunTrust. Please go ahead.", "\nTerrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nActually, on the content side, when you actually look at it \u2013 I presume, Will, your question is around Auto?\n\nTerrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nActually, where we see the content gain, it is traditionally outside of Intercontec. So when you actually look at it, it's really around the integrated solutions where we're providing new technologies is really where we're seeing the content wins as well as Sensors. So I think those combinations where you look at it and really where we've invested in the part what we call our adjacent technologies, they would be things like in EV, where we provide contact. Contactor is not an interconnect, it's actually something that is very important to an electric vehicle.\nWe have a very strong position on it globally. So those are the types of areas we're seeing it and when we look at the terminal connector side, it's growing very nicely, but from a content perspective it's much more outside of Intercontec.\n\nTerrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nHey, Will, could you maybe come up a few more bars on what you define as carrier? I mean, do you mean like the AT&Ts and the British Telecoms?\n\nTerrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nWe do not serve anywhere directly to a carrier anymore. That was part of our BNS business we sold. Certainly, we would sell to the people, our high-speed applications into the carrier network to those people that make the gear, but we do not sell to the carrier.\n\nTerrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nThanks, Will. Thanks for the question.\nSujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nThanks, Will. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Please go ahead.\nSteven Fox - Cross Research LLC\nThanks. Good morning. Just a couple questions, please. First of all, I was wondering, Terrence, you gave a lot of good color around orders. I was curious if you think about everything you talked about, what it says about sort of the business cycle that we're currently in. Are you more encouraged that we're seeing an uptick in economic activity as some may argue or is it sort of similar trends overall, given what you're seeing at distribution versus the easier comparisons, et cetera. Just wondering about your thoughts there, and then I have a follow-up.\nTerrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nYeah, Steve, thanks for asking that question. It's a good question. Where we would say it is, one of the things that's nice, I would say markets overall have a little bit of an upward tilt, and it's actually pretty consistent between regions. So I would say, when we started the year, we gave out our guidance for the year, which are around 3% growth.\nI do think Industrial markets are getting a little better. The auto market is sort of as we called it, Communications is better, but then also regionally when you sit there, we had very strong Asia performance, we talked about it for this quarter, but also it's been very broad based, it's just not the auto discussion we've had.\nEurope continually and incrementally get better and in the Americas, where I would say, it's been sort of sideways for a while, we have seen a little bit of tilt up, really driven around the industrial markets. So, I would say it's incrementally better, I would say it's less choppy than it's been would be phrases I would use, but I would also certainly say that there's still some political ping-pong around the world that I still think, while constructive, we're still ready to move quickly. I don't know, if anything changes that could impact any of the markets.\nSo, overall, I could say it is stronger. I think the orders reflect it, I think the broad base of the growth reflects it and a little bit more confidence in the greater economy, but what I get excited about is that in every region of the world right now, we're seeing some of the upward tilt, which we haven't seen in certain markets recently.\nSteven Fox - Cross Research LLC\nThanks for that. And then, just as a follow-up, on the auto content story, I mean the company has, historically, been known for being a powerhouse around powertrain applications, et cetera. How much of the content is driven by those core historical strength versus maybe new areas like infotainment maybe driving a little bit more of it or is it still mainly going to be a powertrain sort of going forward? Thanks.\nTerrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nNo, it's actually in all three, Steve. So, if you take it, and I know we show a slide when we see investors, if you start to think about our $60 today of content, approximately half of our content today in an auto is around, we call it grain, but to your point, you use the right phrase powertrain. About half of our content is in powertrain. About 40% of our content is around safety applications, and I would put anti-lock brakes, traction control and airbags into those. And then, about the remainder is really around the connected. That would be your convenience, your lighting, the things that happen within the cabin around infotainment, but less mission-critical type items I guess I would say.\nSo, that's really our mix and what's nice is, all of them have opportunities. We talked to you all about, five years from now, we think can get that content up $80 above it. We really feel it's across all three of those categories. So, it isn't just in powertrain. Certainly, powertrain, I think, has the biggest toggle of greater growth, especially as you get to EV adoption, that content is really driven in the powertrain and the infrastructure of the car side. So, I think that's one that has more upside than probably the others, but we're well positioned in all of them regardless.\nSo, I appreciate your compliment about us being a power in the powertrain, I like that. But we do think we've rounded ourselves out and, it gets into some of the questions today, is across Auto and that's really \u2013 it's a credit to our focus in getting ahead and leveraging the technology we can bring to these customers that we serve anywhere they are, both from an engineering site or where they manufacture. It's a real strength that we have.\nSteven Fox - Cross Research LLC\nGreat. Thank you very much.\nTerrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nThanks Steve.\nHeath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nThanks, Steve. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator\nWe do have a question from the line of Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead.\nJim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.\nThank you very much. I have two questions and I'll ask them both at the same time. Probably one CEO-type question and one CFO question. The first one would be, you had mentioned your auto forecast for this year remained unchanged, kind of strength right now and then a deceleration going forward. That's good to hear. The main concern or question we have is are we facing a situation like last year, maybe a different region or whatever, inventory being built up or your forecast of flattish actually being too aggressive as many of the others have kind of talked about a big deceleration coming in? So, how come we're not facing inventory lot buildup and things like that and why you think your forecast were different than others?\nThen, for the CFO, I think you mentioned restructuring of about $150 million. Your operating margins are now performing well in every segment. Should we expect $150 million going forward? Because it is noteworthy that for the past several years, it was coming down. I think now it's kind of come up a little bit. Because you're making so much more profitability, is $150 million the good rate? Is this kind of a peak year and we should expect restructuring to decline or how should we think about those charges? Thank you very much.\nTerrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nHey, Jim, let me start with your first question. Then, I'll let Heath cover your second one. So, thanks for asking the question. First of all, on the auto production, and I know other people have talked about different outlooks for the year, I think one thing that's very important as you all compare these outlooks is, we're in a fiscal period that's (51:50) June and September and our outlook is really from talking to our customers.\nSo, we feel actually very good about where our outlook is, where their production builds are as well as where we plan the supply chain. So, I don't think we're aggressive. I don't think we're conservative. I think we're in line with what our customers are telling us right now. And it's sort of a flattish for the rest of the year. I know I think some others have come out with calendar year guidance. I don't think on a calendar year basis. So, I think, there is an element there that I would ask to just be as reasonable as you compare everybody's opinion about auto production.\nWe do see it moderating like what we've said from day one, mainly driven around China. And we did not have much expectation from North America this year. We expect it to be flat to slightly down and it looks like it's playing out (52:44). So I guess I'll let Heath speak on the restructuring question. Go ahead.\nHeath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nLook, Jim, I think, the restructuring question is certainly a valid comment. I don't know that $150 million would be a number I'd hang my hat on in terms of that. Certainly, there was an opportunity in fiscal 2017 to do some things to optimize our footprint and to make sure that we are aligning where we do business closer to our customers.\nAnd opportunities will avail themselves as we go forward. There's no doubt. There's a handful of things that we continue to contemplate as we go into 2018, but each opportunity has to have its own merits to stand on its own from a cash-on-cash return perspective.\nSo we'll provide more color for that as we go forward, but I think there'll be some element of restructuring as we go into 2018 as we continue to finetune the operating model. But I don't know if it's $150 million or something less than that at this point.\nJim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.\nGreat. Thank you so much for the details. Greatly appreciated.\nTerrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nThanks.\nHeath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nThanks, Jim. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator\nAnd we do have a question from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\nYeah. Thanks and good morning, guys. So, just a question regarding the strong operating margin in the Communications Solution. I think that's the highest margin since you've kind of changed the reporting segments. And I know a lot of that was driven by the portfolio mix, deselecting products, but trying to figure out how much of that strength was due to Subsea Communications versus the mix and versus the change of the portfolio and how sustainable is that going forward?\nHeath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nMatt, it's Heath. That's a fair question, but the year-over-year improvement of nearly 700 basis points in this segment was pretty well balanced across the three business units in the segment, Data and Devices, Appliances and SubCom. They all contributed roughly equal in terms of that margin improvement year-over-year.\nMatthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\nOkay. In terms of targets, particularly, you've given that, it looks like Subsea will be or SubCom will be sort of flattish over the next few quarters into the next fiscal year. I imagine that you're still looking at growth within Appliances and Data and Devices. Is there still an incremental margin that you expect to generate where you can see even better margins there?\nHeath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nWell, certainly, productivity plans will be in place, but the heavy lifting around the footprint consolidation in this segment related to the walk-away revenue that transpired over the last several years, that's behind us. And then, we are largely to, I'll say more of a footprint within the segment. Just a few tweaks left to go in that.\nSo, I would not want to foreshadow that you are going to continue to see 700 basis points year-over-year improvement for the quarter-on-quarter going forward, but certainly we feel good about where the number is today. Knowing that SubCom is probably going to be flattish year-over-year, you would expect more of the incremental operating income improvement to come from Appliances and from D&D, but they are both running pretty hot right now.\nMatthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\nGot it. That's helpful. And just back to Transportation and specifically, the commercial segment, where you've seen a very strong organic growth in an underlying market that is basically even flat to down and weak, but we're starting to see signs of some stabilization from competitors. But, Terrence, what are you seeing in those markets in terms of underlying growth, both in heavy trucks and off-road vehicles?\nTerrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nMatt, it's a good question. I guess to maybe frame a little bit our performance, because I think our performance, this is just not one quarter, it's really been the past couple of years as the overall market was very negative, especially North America. Our over-performance is really driven by our strong position in China, not only North America. We really weathered the storm well. And the growth that we saw this quarter was really driven by emission standards in China as well as content gains with Chinese companies.\nSo, when we look at from a market perspective and we look forward, we do actually see construction starting to pick up after a very tough period, and I think you saw that in some of the results that have come out. Ag still continues to be challenge, a challenge globally. So that's still a market we're waiting to pick up.\nAnd on the truck and bus side, we've really benefited from our strong position globally. So, when we look at it, it does feel like we're starting to get more forward lean in those overall markets, where I would say the last two years has really been between our position and our content gains driving the growth, and it'll be nice as the market starts to click and getting stronger growth in that market. And as I said during the comments, part of our guidance uptick in the second half is really driven by Commercial Transportation as well as our Communications segment. So, we are seeing upward momentum there as we go through the year.\nMatthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\nOkay. Thanks a lot.\nHeath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nThank you, Matt. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator\nAnd we do have a question from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nYes. Good morning and thanks very much for taking the questions. First question is a follow-up on Matt's question about Commercial Transportation. Can you help us understand a little bit more on the regional exposure that you have within Commercial Transportation, maybe how much is North America versus international markets? And then, I know the company mentioned some regulations that were helping the Commercial Transportation business. Can you just elaborate a bit on what sort of benefits you've been seeing from some of those regulations in commercial transport?\nTerrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nYes. Sure. So, (58:59) commercial transportation business is roughly \u2013 I'm trying to get that up \u2013 about 40% of our business is in the Americas, 60% outside the Americas, split evenly between Asia and Europe and really in Asia, when you think about the regulations, it's probably the bigger area, specifically China, we'll be getting the benefit from the emissions regulations that are happening there and a very strong position that we have at increased content wins, providing more to the customer than just what we historically did. So, it's a really good (59:40), but also pretty major content wins we've gotten and the other technologies we're bringing to the customer.\nMark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nYeah, that's helpful. And then, my follow-up question is trying to understand a bit more the order patterns that the company is seeing in the Automotive business. I think guidance for Transportation in the June quarter is about $1.7 billion of revenue and then if you hit the full-year guidance, the kind of the midpoint implies about $1.6 billion. So, if you're seeing growth in Commercial Transport and Sensors, it seems like the implied auto sales for both June and September are down, low to mid-single digits both quarters, normally June is up sequentially. So, are you guys seeing some sequential declines on a quarter-to-quarter basis in the light vehicle business, in line with what your expectations are? I just want to kind of confirm that or is that just some conservatism about you had such strong first half and you're just not sure how the year goes from here?\nTerrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nWhen you look at the second half, we're going to be up pretty much mid-single digits year-over-year, Mark. Clearly, we do expect production to step down. Our first quarter was very strong. As we said, some of that was due to the China stocking. So, we will have sequential changes and limited reduction, but we're going to be up year-over-year and we typically also always step down quarter three to quarter four primarily due to Europe. Just from how the holiday and production seasons work.\nSo, not sure I'm completely following how you're looking at it, but second half year-over-year, we're going to grow mid-single digit on that flattish production. And the shape is a little different this year due to the strong first quarter, but when you get to the rest of the year, Q3 going down to Q4, we would expect the step-down as pretty normal seasonality (01:01:24) European position.\nMark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nThank you very much.\nTerrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nThank you, Mark.\nHeath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nThank you, Mark. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator\nWe do have a question from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nAdrienne Colby - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\nHi. It's Adrienne Colby for Sherri. Thanks for taking the question. Within Industrial, can you talk about what drove the declines in aerospace and defense and also wondering if you could comment from a margin perspective what was driving some of the upside, is it mainly the moderation in the drag from oil and gas, if you're seeing contributions from other pieces of business?\nTerrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nThanks for the question. In aerospace and defense, we still are confident with our outlook for the year. In the quarter, we saw in the commercial aerospace side, just slower pickups from one of the large airplane manufacturers in the quarter. (01:02:13) we expect that will happen in the quarter three, but that was offset by defense picking up and I think that's real positive.\nWhen you look at year-over-year, oil and gas really did not have an impact year-over-year, I mean. So, the tailwind \u2013 with the headwind from oil and gas is behind us, the oil and gas business was pretty constant in the quarter. So, it didn't help our margin. Really, the margin improvement was around the cost actions that we talked to you about, that we were taking in Industrial to continue to improve the margin to get it up into the higher-teens. And I think you should start to see the benefit of that and we expect to continue to see the benefit in the second half. And clearly, that's part of our guidance.\nOur guidance is that Communications and the Industrial will be the margin drivers in the second half, but we're pleased with the performance that the Industrial team did on the margin improvement side in the second quarter.\nAdrienne Colby - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\nGreat. And as a quick follow-up, it looks like SG&A ticked up a little bit this quarter. Just wondering if you could comment on that going forward?\nHeath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nSure. It ticked up, generally pretty seasonal if you think about going back to prior years, generally from from first quarter to second quarter, you'll see that normal tick up and I think if we looked at as a percentage of sales, it's pretty consistent with what we see in the past So, that's the one market we're waiting to pick up. There're some very specific drivers that, the timeliness of investments that we do each year, but pretty consistent and on track with our internal expectations.\nAdrienne Colby - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\nThank you.\nHeath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.\nThank you very much. I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning. And if you have further questions, please contact Investor Relations at TE. Thank you and have a great day.\nTerrence R.

", "At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode and later we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. ", "I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sujal Shah. Please go ahead.", "Sujal Shah", "Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity\u2019s third quarter results. With me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch and Chief Financial Officer, Bob Hau.", "During the course of this call we will be providing certain forward-looking information and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today\u2019s press release. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning and we ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items.

The following are the key takeaways from today\u2019s call: Q3 was another quarter of solid execution as we delivered $0.90 in adjusted EPS, up 6% from last year and above the high end of our guidance. ", "Adjusted operating margins continued to grow and we are up 50 basis points to 15.9% year-over-year. Organic growth was 4% and total growth was 11% excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange. Our harsh environment businesses continue to perform well and generate strong profitability and overall I am pleased with our execution in what characterizes the mix demand environment and we\u2019ll talk about that quite a bit on the call today. ", "Automotive, Sensors, Commercial Air and SubCom led our growth. However, revenue was below our expectations due to weakness in China and supply chain adjustments in some North American industrial markets. We saw order growth begin to slow midway through the quarter and order rates are now running about flat with last year. ", "For the fourth quarter we expect sales up 3% organically versus the prior year and adjusted EPS up 6% at the mid-point. For the full year we expect to deliver 5% organic sales growth and 10% adjusted EPS growth. This guidance is down from what we provided 90 days ago due to the continued weakness in emerging markets, particularly China. In constant currency, full year adjusted EPS growth is expected to be 19% year-over-year.", "We had another good quarter of strategic progress in our Sensor business with key platform wins in automotives, consumer and security application. Strategic rationale for the measurement specialties acquisition continues to play out very well and we are really excited about our prospects here. We now expect the Broadband Network Solutions sale to close in about 90 days earlier than originally expected and expect to use the year $3 billion of proceeds for share buybacks.

From a macro regional perspective, Europe continues to grow and it looks better than it did to us 90 days ago. The U.S. is mixed with a bit lower growth than expected due to supply chain adjustments, let\u2019s say the U.S. looks a little worse, but we do think this is mostly supply chain related and China has weakened with softness becoming more pronounced. ", "From a segment perspective, transportation remains strong with the exception of China. In the industrial solutions segment we see some softening in China and supply chain adjustments in the U.S. market. Communications, data and devices and applications are seeing the impact of a weaker China market. The main them of market here is, we are seeing a weakness in China.

For the full year we are projecting sales of $12.35 billion, up 3% from the prior year and 5% organically. We expect adjusted operating margins to exceed 16% with adjusted EPS up 10% at mid-point and nearly double that in constant currency. Our guidance assumes a 6% adjusted EPS increase in the second half versus last year.

Assuming we had owned measurements and AST last year, our total year-over-year growth in sensors was 10% in Q3.We gained multiple new wins in automotive, consumer and security applications in the quarter. We continue to aggressively build this business and our unmatched customer pacing and engineering resources are a significant asset for TE as proven by our new wins.

Adjusted operating income was $109 million in Q3, down 11% year-over-year, due to unfavorable FX and significant decline in a higher margin oil and gas business, more than offsetting improvement in commercial aerospace. In Q4 we continue to expect similar market trends as Q3 resulting in organic revenue decline in low single digits. ", "Please turn to slide seven.

TE is the world leader in Connectivity and Sensor Solutions and building a leading position in Sensor Solutions, which is a great place to be in the increasingly connected world. And kind of just stepping back, Q3 organic growth is higher than last year, a little lower than our guidance, but its higher than last year. Q4 is a little lower. They have different mix, but nonetheless we are delivering solid organic growth in the second half, in a pretty uncertain economy and growing very solidly when you include the harsh environment M&A that we did last year. ", "As I mentioned, we are growing earnings almost 20% on 10% constant currency growth. This was a big year to really support our harsh environment strategy and I think it\u2019s working very well.

We grew the operating profit of those businesses about $500 million, again at current exchange rates and this portfolio now makes up about 80% of the company. And as we said before, the margins are well above company average. So I feel really, really good about the strength of our harsh business and the resiliency of our harsh businesses. ", "If you go back, this has powered about a 300 basis point improvement in operating margins since 2012. Sensors is a very exciting new growth platform with substantial sales and margin growth opportunity and we\u2019re just at the very beginning of providing integrated packaging solutions. It\u2019s very, very early, but I\u2019ve talked to a lot of customers about this and the opportunity is real and will be another source of growth for the company. And the net of all this is, over the past several years we\u2019ve really transformed TE into what I\u2019d call an industrial technology company.", "Overall I think though this company is performing very well. We\u2019re positioned very well. We do view the recent softness to be temporary. We don\u2019t have a crystal ball of course, but when we look at the fundamental drivers underlying all our businesses, we feel very good about them. It reinforces the strategy we have. That strategy is pretty straight forward and we look forward to continuing to execute it very aggressively and delivering solid performance across the company.", "So with that, we\u2019re going to open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we do have a question from Amitabh Passi of UBS. Your line is opened.", "Amitabh Passi", "Hi guys, good morning. Tom I had a question and then maybe a follow up for the rest of the team. Just on your transportation solution segment, operating margins came in below 20%. I think you attributed part of that to mix weaker commercial transportation. It also looks like ongoing investments in sensors. I just want to get a sense whether we should expect that sort of level now to persist for the next couple of quarters and then as a follow up you intriguingly mentioned a few design wins in the automotive segment and sensors. I was wondering if you could touch on that and maybe provide a greater insight.", "Tom Lynch", "Obviously on the second question, we can\u2019t say too much as I\u2019m sure you understand, but as far as the margin goes, we expect the margin to continue to be in the 20% range plus or minus depending on mix. ", "As Bob pointed out, the three major segments in the business, all improved their margin year-over-year. Sensors margins are lower than industrial transportation and automotive as expected and that\u2019s why I mentioned its one of the real opportunity to continue to grow profitability as we scale that business. So we don\u2019t see anything short of a significant volume decline. I think when we\u2019re running the 4% to 5% growth rate, we have the momentum to continue to deliver strong margin. So plus or minus 20% a little bit is what I would expect over the next several quarters.", "Amitabh Passi", "Okay. Can I squeeze another follow up there?", "Tom Lynch", "Of course.", "Amitabh Passi", "Okay, thanks. And then maybe just on the supply chain adjustments you talked about. Again, I don\u2019t know if you have any visibility or insight. I mean is this a one, two quarter phenomena. Just generally how you expect the supply chain and the potentially excess inventories to be digested here in the near term.", "Tom Lynch", "I mean we do have some insight, because we are large through the channel, right. So we have a very big business through the channel which serves tens of thousands, actually hundreds of thousands of end customers. So we feel like that\u2019s kind of a statistically sound base of information to look at and the channel was pretty robust in the first half just like our industrial businesses as everybody was expecting a little bit stronger second half and we have seen that tighten up. We\u2019ve seen it tighten up on sell through and sell-ins. I think the good news is coming out of the last big downturn, everybody in the supply chain is very glued together in terms of what\u2019s going on, so we react much quicker than we did. ", "Of course it\u2019s hard to predict with a ton of confidence how long it will last, but what our forecast reflects is it starts to abate through the fourth quarter, our fourth quarter and that by the time we get into the first quarter it should be largely behind us from the industrial part of the business. That\u2019s the kind of forecast, that\u2019s what we\u2019re hearing from the market, so that\u2019s the best insight we have right now.", "Sujal Shah", "Okay, thanks Amitabh. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Amit Daryanani", "Thanks a lot. Good morning guys. I guess to start off with, Tom I look at the guide you guys are providing right now, adjusting to that next scale wind, your sort of reducing your forward expectations for the full year by about $235 million, $240 million. Could you talk about how much of that is really due to the softness in China that you\u2019re talking about and how much of that is perhaps due to the product exist in data and devices that you guys are undergoing?", "Tom Lynch", "Amit, I think the way to think about that, the $240 million narrow before the tailwind from FX, is really a spread relatively evenly across all three of our segments; transportation, industrial and communications. All three of them are seeing the implication of slower China and then we\u2019re also seeing the implication of the supply chain or inventory adjustments really in our industrial and appliances business in those last two segments.", "Amit Daryanani", "Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then if I just think of the transportation segment with China slowing down, Europe seems to be holding up well to you guys so far. I\u2019m curious, what\u2019s your thought on \u2013 how much of your Europe exposure you think ends up as exports to China essentially and do you think that could be another level on concern you will have to contend with as you go down the next few quarters.", "Tom Lynch", "Well, just to put it in \u2013 our China auto business is now flat to slightly down. It\u2019s really the first time since probably the financial crisis and well that\u2019s what we got reflected in the fourth quarter. So we are definitely seeing less imports into China of high end vehicles. I think you\u2019ve heard several OEMs report their outlook for their China sales. So we\u2019re seeing some of that. I believe we have that reflected in our European automotive numbers. ", "We generally have pretty good visibility. Its again not perfect visibility, but we\u2019ve taken our overall China numbers down quite a bit and I think it would be important to highlight that. Quarter-over-quarter we\u2019re going to be down about 12% in China revenue; that\u2019s last year\u2019s fourth to this year\u2019s fourth and its pretty broad based as Bob said. And the overall $240 million that Bob referred to, about two-thirds of that is China and Latin America, of course China being the biggest piece. ", "It had been slowing; it slowed more abruptly. I think this is key quarter to see is that seems like maybe things are settling down over there now over the last few weeks. It\u2019s just now begun the bottom out and recover, because we think the core fundamentals of a large population, a growing middle class, growing incomes, urbanization, a place for all of our businesses, particularly where we\u2019re strong, which is harsh environment and as I mentioned, harsh businesses overall are still growing slightly despite a broader slowdown in China.", "Sujal Shah", "Okay, thank you Amit. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Craig Hettenbach", "Yes, thanks. Just following up on some of the commentary on China weakness. Have you seen any change more broadly on the automotive side in terms of production forecasts you get. Like what OEMs are doing in this environment? Are they cutting back slightly to reflect that or any type of additional information on the production side would be helpful? ", "Tom Lynch", "I mean what we\u2019re \u2013 with our customers at the OEMs are telling us is in the fourth quarter they plan longer than usual in China shutdown; a week, maybe some after two weeks, so there\u2019s definitely a goal to balance inventory throughout the channel, including cars on the lot. Now the inventories aren\u2019t crazy. I think they\u2019ve been keeping them pretty tight there, but definitely reflect the slowing demand. ", "Craig Hettenbach", "Got it. And then if I could switch gears just to the MES, the commentary that that acquisition has gone well, any specific anecdotes you can talk about in terms of as you look to leverage that through your broader distribution channel, through you customer relationships. Like what type of upticks you are seeing from that as they potentially benefit from a much broader platform at TEL.", "Tom Lynch", "Sure. I think the broad anecdote, we can\u2019t get too specific yet as you know customers have their requirements, but a consistent anecdote is particularly in starting with auto and across several of our harsh environment businesses. We are spending a lot of time with customers where we bring in the product and technology express for measurement and get them into places where they couldn\u2019t get in before and we\u2019re seeing a lot of bidding activity resulting from that, because they are really a fine, fine engineering and technology and product company. ", "I think as I\u2019ve mentioned on these calls before, we knew them quite well and certainly expected that and that\u2019s why we acquired them, but the deeper we got, the more engineers and applications engineers, we got to know the better we even felt about that, so where it\u2019s kind of interesting. In some ways the biggest challenge we have is which one is the pick, because there\u2019s a lot of opportunities to pick one. ", "I mean as Bob mentioned we are ramping up our resources in a thoughtful way in that business, so that we can take on more and more design opportunities. But it\u2019s pretty broad based. I\u2019d say that it\u2019s definitely focused in the harsh, although we had some \u2013 we can\u2019t talk about it too much, but some really key wins in consumer that its very good business. Again, because these are highly engineered components and packaged in a way that they can perform their function no matter how they are treated by the consumer. So we\u2019re pretty excited about that. ", "So I\u2019d say it\u2019s been a good almost first year, about a year now of working with this team and the back end, bringing lien into the operation, figuring the best place out, where to make things, putting the organization together, that\u2019s all done, so we feel like that first year where your figuring things out and how do you best work together, how do you leverage strength but not turn off the small company, but I think I\u2019d give us very high marks for that and now we\u2019re really going on the defensive what\u2019s getting in from of customers.", "Sujal Shah", "Okay, thank you Craig. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.", "Mark Delaney", "Yes, good morning and thanks very much for taking the questions. The first question was just some clarification on the comments about some of the monthly trends that you\u2019re seeing with the business. Tom I understand you talked about seeing some weakness beginning during the June quarter and I think you commented that on a year-over-year basis bookings are pretty flat. Could you just clarify if you\u2019ve seen any stabilization in the monthly order patterns or you\u2019re still seeing some month to month declines in the bookings?", "Tom Lynch", "I would say, it feels like its stabilizing. Week to week things bounce around, but we\u2019re really kind of running at this ex-SubCom level to $2.9 billion to $3 billion order rate.", "Mark Delaney", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful and then for a follow up question, I\u2019m going to focus on SubC. I guess a two part question. First, it seems like the comments for the fiscal \u201915 revenue guidance, just a little bit above 700, it seems like a real small downtick versus the comments for $720 million on the last conference call. So can you maybe just help us understand \u2013 I know its small, but if anything\u2019s kind of changing that\u2019s driving that slight change to the revenue forecast for SubC for fiscal \u201915. ", "And then second part on SubC, just given the new award that you\u2019ve won, what sort of visibility do you have into fiscal \u201916 revenue in the SubC business?", "Tom Lynch", "Mark, your right. There is an ever so slight decline, $720 million to $712 million, $715 million, something like that if I remember correctly and that\u2019s really just the timing of some material coming in, when we get it loaded on the ship. This is a project business and so as you progress, as material comes in, all you need is a vendor to be late by a week and you lose some revenue, but it is purely timing so no implication of that whatsoever.", "In terms of \u201916, two of it to give guidance for \u201916, but obviously we\u2019ve done well this year. We feel good about adding the fifth program in force and we\u2019re spending that this year and that\u2019s now $1.5 billion enforced for us.", "Mark Delaney", "Thank you.", "Sujal Shah", "Okay, thank you Mark. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "The next question comes from William Stein from SunTrust.", "William Stein", "Thanks for taking my question. Tom, earlier you mentioned that you saw part of the slowdown extending through the fiscal Q4 guidance and likely ending in Q1. So this clarification is really about whether that\u2019s the China related weakness or the North American sort of channel adjustments you\u2019re seeing or that it relates to both and what gives you the confidence to have the view that this ends by the end of fiscal Q4. Thank you.", "Tom Lynch", "Sure, thanks Will. Really my comment about we think it will \u2013 based on what we\u2019re seeing and hearing now, worked its way through in Q4 as the North America industrial and part of that is end demand is still, its slower. It feels slower than what we\u2019re hearing in the second half and first half, but it\u2019s not off that much and we still have a pretty healthy American economy, even though I think most of us feel it\u2019s not growing the way we thought it would. It\u2019s still growing in all the indicators like payrolls and things, so. And then when we just look at the sell in and the sell through, what we\u2019re hearing is that that should start to work its way through by the end of our fiscal year, that\u2019s our best estimate at this time. ", "China is harder to tell. I think just because data is harder to get. I mean kind of the only data you have is your own data and we have seen China can move up very quickly as well. So I\u2019m more uncertain about that Will and I mean last year we had a tremendous first quarter in China. Actually we had a pretty good first half and saw it again, the same for the second half, so it\u2019s harder to tell there. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this has kind of leaked in through the first quarter, but that\u2019s a guestimate based just on recent order trends.", "Sujal Shah", "Okay, thank you Will. Next question please. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Shawn Harrison from Longbow Research. Please go ahead.", "Shawn Harrison", "Hi, a two part initial question if I may and then a brief follow-up. On the BNS business and then also the proceeds, is the BNS business still running at kind of a $0.53 EPS run rate for the year. And then on the proceeds in terms of deploying that, is that on top of the typical buyback where you\u2019ve been spending $150 million to $250 million a quarter, so we\u2019d see say $200 million on average of buyback and then $600 million or $800 million a quarter of incremental buyback once the deal closes.", "Tom Lynch", "Yes Shawn, the BNS business as you know is now recorded in our discontinued operations. I would say it is broadly or generally performing as we expected through the sale process. In terms of proceeds, we have a practice or a capital requirement approach of $150 million to $250 million per quarter share repurchase. We did $252 million this most recently completed quarter. We expect to be in the market in the fourth quarter. Once the BNS transaction closes, that will be an additional $3 billion or that we\u2019ll be able to return the majority of that back to the shareholders. That\u2019s in addition to our appointment of our operating free cash flow.", "Shawn Harrison", "Okay, and then as a brief follow up, Tom as you could just remind us and I guess delineate between the content you have per vehicle in China versus say Europe, so the declines we\u2019re seeing in China auto production. Just to weight that a bit and how much of what you\u2019re seeing right now is truly declines in production versus some other factors in terms of maybe mix going against you.", "Tom Lynch", "I would say it\u2019s definitely production related. Our content in China is SubC. It\u2019s much higher in Europe, but there can be a mix effect that it\u2019s kind of interesting over any period of time that we look at, it just doesn\u2019t \u2013 the numbers are so big, its 80 some million cars being sold. With the math kind of almost moved itself out unless you had a pneumatic shift. I mean we were worried coming out of the last downturn that the world is going to go to buying small cars and that is going to have an impact on our content and we didn\u2019t see any of that. ", "Now the exciting thing about China is content is growing faster in China cars, both local and multinational and how far in China right now are local SUVs where we have really no content and our content in China regardless of whether the local Chinese auto maker or multinationals, really almost exactly the same. In fact a little higher with the locals because we provide a little more to them than we would the OEM, which is a real strategic advantage that we started back in the downturn. ", "So I guess the short answer Shawn is or the long answer is we are not really seeing that much impact. If at all its kind of in the $0.10 to $0.20 range of content per unit mix at this point.", "Shawn Harrison", "Very helpful Tom, thanks so much.", "Sujal Shah", "Right, thank you Shawn. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "The next question comes from Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank.", "Sherri Scribner", "Hi, thanks. I was curious \u2013 I don\u2019t know if I missed it, but did you give a number for global vehicle production in this quarter and then also could you give us some detail on how much China is as a percent of revenue for the three different segments. I know that Asia Pacific is about a third of your business, but maybe some metrics around how big China is by different segments would be helpful.", "Tom Lynch", "Sure. At a high level China is running in the 17%, 18% of our total business, that\u2019s total company. It\u2019s much higher than that in data and devices. Part of that is because most of the production is in China and it is sometimes hard to in those kind of businesses to where is consumption locally and where is consumption globally. Our auto business which runs over $1 billion is our local consumption.", "Sherri Scribner", "Okay.", "Bob Hau", "And then the other part of your question Sherri is that auto production volumes for the fourth quarter. Well, we have in our current guidance auto production for the fourth quarter globally, about $21 million vehicles, up about 2.5% year-over-year. That gets it to the 2% on a full year basis, just under $87 million vehicles.", "Sherri Scribner", "And did you have a 3Q number?", "Bob Hau", "3Q was down three-tenths of a percent, about 21.5 million, 21.7 million units.", "Sherri Scribner", "Okay. And then can I just ask the question about the transportation segment. I think your long term goal has been to grow that segment in the high single digits and it looks like we\u2019re tracking a little bit below that. This year I know there has been some puts and takes, but what\u2019s your view overall of the ability to continue to grow that segment in the high single digits. Thanks.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks Sherri. I think at historical production levels of about 3% and the last three years is going to average out. If you take next year\u2019s estimates this year and last year, it\u2019s going to average out to about that. We would expect to do that, especially with our expansion into sensors which will go \u2013 we\u2019re kind of going from a very low base there. Yes, I think that production grows in that 3%. We expect to grow two plus ex production, which is what we\u2019re doing this year. ", "So for example, this year production is growing 2% and we\u2019re growing 6% plus. So we still see it on hold and I think we really feel good about this year\u2019s performance, because it proves out what we\u2019ve been saying about the pipeline of wins that we\u2019ve had over the last four or five years and that we\u2019re growing our win rates faster than the market\u2019s growing and now that\u2019s showing up in kind of this multiplier production effect. ", "So if you go back four or five years, we were always saying 1.5 times production and now we\u2019re over 2 times production and as we begin to ramp the sensors business over the next several years, that will increase it even more. So we feel very good about this great auto business of ours.", "Bob Hau", "I\u2019d say in the current quarter or to me the current year, we\u2019re definitely seeing the headwind from FX impacting the overall growth. If you back that out, transportation is well above the 6% to 8% and that\u2019s also got the benefit of the acquisition. Our guidance is mid single digits organically. That\u2019s below that 6% to 8% long term rate and that\u2019s really driven by slower commercial vehicle, both in heavy truck declines in the second half of this year and slower off road, but long term we still believe the 6% to 8%.", "Sujal Shah", "Thank you, Sherri. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jim Suva from Citi.", "Jim Suva", "Thank you very much. Congratulations to you and your team. On slide six of your prepared handouts entitled Industrial Solutions, I was taking a look at the operating margins. I know unless the questions have been focused on transportation, which is like I said, but kind of looking away from the other areas for the potential improvement, the operating margins for industrial solutions came down pretty meaningfully year-over-year and yes of course the actual and organic sales came down 5% to 1%, but the 100 basis point decline in operating margins is a pretty big gap. ", "Can you talk just a little bit about that, because to me it seems like this is one area of meaningful improvement that you can give to the company and is it really tied now to sales for the future of this company or restructuring, are you doing some plant consolidation or how should we think about what actions your actively doing or would you simply tie the sales for improving this turnaround of this, several of which is below corporate average. ", "Tom Lynch", "Thank you, Jim. Well yes, the margin decline as we pointed out there is really two big factors, right. The oil and gas business is down 30%-plus and that\u2019s the highest margin business in the segment and FX and we have a strong European industrial footprint, particularly in energy and in industrial equipment and they are strong margin businesses, so particularly energy which has been slow, thus our equipment business actually has been pretty good. ", "If you go through the make-up of the business and talk about who knows how long this oil and gas thing is going to last, but that team has managed to despite a 35% decline in revenue, keep the margin in solid double digits and the piece we bought, which is more in the service and support side than the new project side is still in the 20% plus range. ", "So what I would say is our aerospace defense business is very strong, was there above company average margins. Our oil and gas are low right now, but again who knows when, but as that grows, that inherently because of its harshest environment characteristics and higher margin business. ", "Industrial equipment is the one that\u2019s the big fragmented business that serves multiple industries, lots of small customers that we\u2019ve been steady improving. Growth slowed down a little bit right now, but that\u2019s where you are seeing us in the past and continuing to fine tune our manufacturing network. TEOA is especially important there in this slow volume high mix business. But those margins today are at about company average withholding it down right now, oil and gas and energy; energy because the Europe oil and gas is just something that happened in the market. ", "We still believe and are committed to this, say above company average margin business. ", "Jim Suva ", "And for that pressure from oil and gas, you\u2019re just going to wait for it to come back or do you like proactively make some plant adjustments\u2026", "Tom Lynch", "We kept the margins in double digits by being very proactive. I mean super proactively, Bob you want to add on to that. ", "Bob Hau", "Jim, as I mentioned in my opening comments, we\u2019ve now increased our restructuring charge for $100 million. Part of that is communications, restructuring and part of that is oil and gas. So we\u2019ve definitely been taking action this year.", "Jim Suva ", "Okay, and then as a quick follow-up for the stock buyback you had mentioned that the BNS is looking to close about \u2013 I mean a little bit earlier than expected, within 90 days. Can you remind us and investors about your cadence or appetite for the stock buyback and time that you are going to do? I think it\u2019s about a $3 billion sales proceeds, and what timing that one should expect the stock buyback. It looks like the acquisition, divestiture is going to close a bit earlier. ", "Bob Hau", "Yes, so we had been indicating we expected that transaction to close by the end of the calendar year. We now see that closing within the next 90 days or so and as you indicate, its $3 billion of proceeds and we have said really since the date we announced the transaction back in January, that it would be \u2013 the vast majority of those proceeds would be used for share buyback and we have not indicated the specific timing of that. ", "Jim Suva ", "Great. Thank you very much. ", "Sujal Shah", "Great, thank you Jim. Can we have the next question please? ", "Operator", "The next question comes from Wamsi Mohan from BoA/Merrill Lynch.", "Ruplu Bhattacharya ", "Yes, good morning. Its Ruplu filling in for Wamsi. Tom, just a high level question to start. Can you just give us your thoughts on the overall product portfolio? Are you done with the product exists that you were doing in the data and devices segment and overall is there any more opportunity to rationalize the product portfolio. ", "A - Tom Lynch", "I think the product portfolio is pretty solid right now, and I\u2019ll cover about a few exceptions for that comment. We are still rationalizing in data and devices. Our strategy there is to really focus on our core connectivity business, which is a good business for us and move out of what we\u2019ve now seen to be commodities and things like that, and that\u2019s going well and that\u2019s why you see such big declines in that business, because we are elegantly in treating our customers well, but existing those products. ", "Across the rest of the portfolio, I think you will see more adding than subtracting. And whatever we do on the subtraction would be more fine turning around \u2013 hey we don\u2019t, this range is a commodity, it\u2019s not really strategic, we don\u2019t need it to sell other products, we don\u2019t want to put our energy into it. I would rather you know anything that widens this harsh environment mode and sensor business is where our inorganic and organic investments are going. If you see further exits, it will really be around the edges. ", "Ruplu Bhattacharya ", "Okay, thanks for that. And then just for my follow-up. You talked about the heavy truck market being weak in China. Can you talk about the other -geographies; are you seeing weakness in any other place apart from China in that market?", "Tom Lynch", "I think in North America as you know it\u2019s been a very hot market, the last couple of years. The growth rate is slowing but no surprise there, we\u2019ve all expected that. But we expect heavy trucks to continue to grow. We actually expect China to kind of rebound eventually. It\u2019s hard to call, but you went through a nice surge with the adoption of Euro 4 and really, the government really drove that hard. ", "So at a period where trucks were going down and content was going way up, and there has been a little shift in China to smaller trucks, but we believe with all the infrastructure building over there that\u2019s going on, that will swing back to larger trucks which are much more efficient and there is a lot of opportunity in China to improve the transportation of goods industry, and that play to our strength, because that\u2019s more content. ", "So I think in a little bit longer term, probably hopefully late next year you will start to see China pick-up. The U.S. continues to be okay and Europe has been pretty solid. The challenge in the industrial transportation market has been off-road. As we know the agriculture, industry has been really not investing due to where foreign prices are and you have the commodity industry, you have the spillover effect of oil prices down. So construction, although is mixed, it\u2019s starting to level off. All those industries have been a drag over the last few years. ", "So what I think will happen over time is you will see those industries begin to recovery because of pent up demand. You will get a lower growth rate in heavy trucks and this business will over time return to kind of a low single digit production growth rate, which is very attractive for us because we have so much content and we\u2019ve grown our content so much over the last couple of years. ", "Ruplu Bhattacharya ", "Thanks. I appreciate the color. ", "Sujal Shah", "Thank you, Ruplu. Can we have the next question please? ", "Operator", "The next question comes from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. ", "Matt Sheerin", "Yes thanks. Most of the questions have been answered, but I did want to go back to the commentary about the distribution inventory correction that seems to be going on. Could you give us a sense of what you are seeing on a sell in basis versus sellout and expectations for where do you think investors are going to go and what do inventory days look like at distribution now versus where they should be. ", "Tom Lynch", "Days are up a little bit, but I think it\u2019s more single digit in days and my conversation with the distributors again I think everybody has been managing it, we are all managing it much better than we did over the last time around because of what we\u2019ve learnt. ", "So I mean clearly the first half, we had nice growth in our sell-in in the first half and sell through was pretty solid too, but we began to see late second quarter early Q3 sell through began to slow a big and that\u2019s when the inventories began to build a little bit and I think we were like lets jump on this quickly and get things in balance. ", "So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big horrendous deal, but it\u2019s enough to have our third quarter being slightly down in the change and probably our fourth quarter relatively flat, but that\u2019s why we think the coming into Q1 sell through and inventory levels are back to where they should be. Again, I don\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s not a major disruption, but it is a fine tuning which I think is good, just because it\u2019s so good when it\u2019s happening, because you are selling that. But I think it is good because the system is more in balance. ", "Matt Sheerin", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful and just a quick question for Bob. Your share count assumption for the quarter in your guidance, what\u2019s that?", "Bob Hau", "So we expect that in fourth quarter we\u2019ll continue with that, between $150 million to $250 million range, so call it 1 million or 2 million share reduction in the quarter.", "Matt Sheerin", "Okay, thanks a lot guys. ", "Sujal Shah", "All right, thank you Matt. Can we have the next question please? ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike Wood from Macquarie Securities Group. ", "Mike Wood", "Hi, thanks for all the information. [Indiscernible] to breakout the SubCom charge is what you are trying to do with increasing margins in the mobile device sub segment. Can you just give us more color of what\u2019s happening in those two sub markets? ", "Tom Lynch", "The sub segments are data in devices Mike. ", "Mike Wood", "So yes, SubCom end is on the mobile device side where you are exiting some lower margin product. How successful are you in getting that margin up in the mobile device side. ", "Tom Lynch", "Yes, so on the mobile, we would call it data and device business. If we combine those businesses, we announced that earlier in the year because customers are converging, technologies are becoming more similar and frankly we needed to reduce costs in those two businesses, which are our two weakest business. ", "So we are still in the turnaround. I think we have some good wins, we have some losses. I don\u2019t think there is enough there to say from a market perspective we are changing our position. We are changing our cost structure and we are getting back into the product range which we do best, kind of core connector clientage for the board type of connector power connectors, where we are very good and that we want to put a lion\u2019s share of our energy around. ", "So it\u2019s still in the kind of midway through the turnaround I would say, stabilizing but not exciting from a profitability point of view. We still have work to do to reestablish the growth and get the margins up to double digit. ", "On the SubCom side as Bob mentioned seems steady progress in the market. We continue to have a high win rate. There continues to be a lot of bid activity. The cloud players are very active in this. So that, we pointed out before, that\u2019s a big change from the primary drivers were before. But fundamentally we think it\u2019s a good change, because there is a tremendous desire for high quality service and plenty of bandwidth, because that\u2019s so integral for the total value proposition of those players. So we think that\u2019s a fundamentally good driver and backlog now for $1.5 billion. ", "So I would say, we continue to see more approved points that we are in the uptick site. We are feeling good, pretty good through \u201916. You got to keep knocking off several wins a year control the pipeline, but overall we feel good that, \u2018Sure, SubCom is on the way back up and we are getting our arms around the date and devices business from a strategy and a cost structure. We can see, this where we want to be. ", "Mike Wood", "Great and then on MES it seems like if I back into the numbers it would roughly similar contribution versus last quarter to the segment. Has that seen any impact yet from China? I believe China was just under 20% of sales and is that expected of any is there any restructuring actions taking off at that weakness. ", "Bob Hau", "I would say, I\u2019d call it a consistent quarter. Although certainly we are going to see is China in general slows down. We\u2019ll see an impact but not significant and overall, growing very nicely organically as I mentioned. Our sensors business, if we had owned AST and measurement this quarter last year, that business grew 10%. So certainly seeing some nice growth overall. ", "Tom Lynch", "I would say in China, sensors are not as established in the vehicles over there, so particularly in the local vehicles. So you have kind of a more, an additional demand for that in order to become competitive, you need to put more features in. So we feel that\u2019s an extra demand driver and the only per say restructuring that\u2019s going on is where we are combining for scale. We are not doing in response to market conditions, oh! Its growing slower so we are taking part of that.", "We are investing in the businesses as I said from that perspective, so that we can win more deals and growth faster. ", "Mike Wood", "Great, thank you. ", "Sujal Shah", "Okay, thank you. Can we have the next question please? ", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Steven Fox from Cross Research. ", "Steven Fox", "Thanks. Just one question for me. I\u2019m just a little confused still by the increase in the restructuring charges understanding what you just said. But you expressed a lot of positive statements around the harsh environments in general, but you are downsizing oil and gas. And then along the same lines your are doing some product pruning, which I would has been an ongoing effort for a number of years. I\u2019m just curious how that \u2013 what that has to do with restructuring and whether that was also in response to end markets. Thanks. ", "Tom Lynch", "Yes Jim, I\u2019ll let Bob add to this too. Oil and gas is adjusting to the 35% decline in the business and the natural uncertainty about everything that\u2019s going on around oil, which does a run come back in, when do oil prices go up, etc\u2026 ", "The remainder of the increase is related to kind of the phase of, accelerating the phase of data and device. So that\u2019s what is related to. We are really not restructuring in any other business, Bob. ", "Bob Hau", "Yes, the vast majority of our restructuring to-date and will be for the year is in the communication segment and in oil and gas in particular. Oil and gas last year was at $300 million business. We are going to exist a $200 million clip. That really calls for some pretty significant restructuring and then data and devices in combination of the product exits that we\u2019ve really been underway for call it, 12 to 18 months and closer into that 12 months, plus the combination of the old Datacom and the consumer business drove us to take some additional costs out. But we are not taking our costs in our harsh environment growing to your other question, Mike\u2019s question on measurement, we are not talking out cost where we\u2019ve got growth opportunity. ", "Steven Fox", "Understood and then just real quick. I understand the need to sort of keep your plans for a buyback close to your, best for now. But I mean when the closes can we expect some kind of signals around how you plan to execute or use that $3 billion in proceeds or is this sort of going to be statuesque and learn about sort of on a backward looking basis. ", "Tom Lynch", "I think one of the hallmarks of TE has been some pretty good transparency and once the deal closes and we get into the activity, we\u2019ll give you some color about what our expectations are. ", "Operator", "And our last question comes from the line of William Stein from SunTrust. ", "William Stein", "Thanks for taking my follow-up. So with the pull-in of the timing of the BNS sale, can you just highlight to us what the regulatory approvals that you are still waiting on are and with regard to the $3 billion consideration, understanding that you\u2019ve told us that you expect to use the majority for buybacks, would you consider another acquisition potentially in the sensory area. At the Analyst Day you were \u2013 the company I would say was still constructive on its intention to acquire in that space and I wonder if think could be an opportunity to readdress that. Thank you.", "Tom Lynch", "Well, let me address the second part of that question. I think that the strength of the company is our strong cash flow, a really strong capital structure, strong operating leverage and all that provides choices, right. So we clearly have an active M&A pipeline, sensors and harsh environment are very important to us and where we get the right opportunity to strengthen those businesses we would see them. Of course it has to be at the price that we think fits with our strategy and our return goals. ", "So yes, I mean the bottom line is we can do both. That\u2019s really the simple method, we can do both. And if you look back the last few years that\u2019s what we have done. We bought MES, we bought AST, we did a significant buyback. I think that\u2019s really one of the strengths of TE. ", "Bob Hau", "And then in terms of the timing well, we pulled it in a bit from end of the calendar year to now within 90 days. We have really three large regulatory hurdles; U.S., Europe and China. We have U.S. and Europe, so we are awaiting China and of course there are a number of other countries that have the right and obligation to weigh in. But it\u2019s really those big three and of course then where comp stocks in the midst of integration planning that we are helping them with, obviously and let them comment on that progression, but it really is at this point a regulatory hurdle with China. ", "William Stein", "Great, thanks very much. ", "End of Q&A ", "Sujal Shah", "All right. Thank you, Will. If you have follow-up questions please contract Investor Relations at TE. Thank you for joining us this morning, and have a great day. Thanks everybody. ", "Tom Lynch ", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference today.

(Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. John Roselli. Please go ahead.", "John Roselli", "Thanks, Rochelle and good morning. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Tyco Electronics' second quarter results for fiscal year 2009 and our outlook for the third quarter.", "With me today is our Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch and our Chief Financial Officer, Terrence Curtin.", "During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask you to look at today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary statements that we have included there. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning and we ask you to read through the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items. The press release and all related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at tycoelectronics.com.", "Now let me turn the call over to Tom for some opening comments.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks, John and good morning, everyone. Today, we are introducing a slide show to accompany our review here, so hopefully that's helpful for you and if you can move to slide 2, we will get started.", "As we expected, the weak global economic conditions did have a significant impact on our business this quarter as our sales declined 28% organically year-over-year and our adjusted operating earnings declined 85%. So it was a tough quarter from that perspective, although what we expected going into the quarter.", "Our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.14 and that does include a $0.07 benefit from a tax rate that was more favorable than our guidance rate. If you were to use our guidance tax rate of 30%, our adjusted earnings per share would have been in the middle of the guidance range we provided last quarter. The tax rate will tend to fluctuate a little bit at these income levels. Terrence will expound on that when he walks you through the financials in more detail in a few minutes.", "Our business conditions remain weak and visibility is limited, but we have seen our order rates stabilize over the last two months, last March and April, as compared to the weakening trends we were seeing at the time of our last call.", "In our businesses that serve consumer markets, which includes automotive, order rates have picked up over the last couple months. In our industrial markets, orders are still soft and weakening a bit. The good news is we are seeing stabilization in orders, but it is off a much lower base than the prior year, but things do feel a little bit better now than they did three months ago as inventories in the supply chain, particularly in the consumer market and most especially in the automotive markets we serve, have been reduced considerably.", "So feeling better; visibility still limited, however, and I think most of what we are seeing is, the inventories getting back in line.", "Now I want to spend a few minutes updating you on the progress we are making with the strategy we laid out almost two years ago when we separated the company and then, as today, the strategy has three main elements to it: positioning the company for accelerated growth, improving our operating leverage and focusing the portfolio. Notwithstanding the weak business conditions that are out there, we still have our eye clearly on the ball of positioning this business for growth.", "Our strategy there really has four key points: Accelerating new product introductions and better leveraging our technology portfolio, and I'm going to talk about a couple of key new wins for us in a minute; expanding our reach and service levels through the distribution and web channels. We are very strong with the large OEMs. That has always been our strength and we put a lot of resources in front of those customers and have a lot of success there. We want to be as strong and as effective with the other half of our business, which tends to be the smaller customers. So we have a lot in process to improve our ability to reach customers through alternative channels.", "Thirdly, as part of our growth, continue to strengthen our position in emerging markets. Naturally, that is where a lot of growth is going to continue to come from. We do have a very strong position in China, Russia, Eastern Europe and India. We are continuing to invest there and most importantly, continuing to build our talent there.", "The fourth element of this growth strategy is to broaden our product range through strategic acquisitions. Now we haven't done any of that. We have been much more focused on cleaning up the portfolio that resulted from all the acquisitions that came before to form this business, but we do feel that our platform and infrastructure will lend itself to augmenting our current portfolio of products and technologies when the right opportunities come up at the right time and we are focused on building that pipeline.", "So with respect to new products, I'd just like to give you a couple of good examples. The platforms are important. What's really important is broadening the markets we serve with the technology we have. The first one in our aerospace and defense and marine business; we recently won a very key award with Airbus in what is known as the Raceway program. This product provides a solution to protect the aircraft's electrical system from electrical interference and lightning strikes.", "There are a couple of very important things about this award. One, these new airliners, that will be rolling out, are made of composite materials. That changes the characteristics of the electrical system a little bit, how it has to deal with interference and lightning strikes. So this was a big win that really highlights the kind of strength we have in electrical and mechanical technology.", "This product will initially be deployed on the new A350 and it is more than about $100,000 in content per plane. Really the most exciting piece about this is we have not been a major player in Airbus. This gives us a very strong position there and really positions us as a strategic supplier to them. We have always been strong in Boeing and we're getting stronger there as well.", "Another good example is in our energy business and we have about $1 billion of energy business revenue in the company. We serve the biggest part of that is we serve utility. For most of our existence, we've served the low-to-medium voltage part of that market. About three years ago, we began to expand our product line to address the high-voltage market. That is where a lot of the accelerated growth is going to come.", "Recently, we introduced a whole new range of porcelain insulators, starting with the North American market. We are starting to see nice traction with that. This was a gap in our product offering and this is going to give us access to a range of new applications.", "So two examples of the kind of things we have been doing in the company to better harness the range of technology we have.", "In addition to these new product launches, we are seeing increased opportunities to gain market share, especially in automotive. Just in the last six months, we've been on more than $150 million of opportunities in the automotive business that was previously supplied by competitors, in many cases, previously business that we had not won. We are being approached to rebid for these programs, because our customers are increasingly looking for partners like ourselves that have the financial resources to not only get through the current times, but to invest for the future.", "So I think the 50 to 60 years we have been in this business, the strength means more than it ever did to our customers.", "And then up my last comment on growth, as you know, we talked last quarter about the formation of a new Specialty Products segment and what we did is we broke out four businesses that were previously grouped with our more traditional interconnect business and this is our aerospace, defense and marine; medical; touch systems; and circuit protections. These businesses all have an attractive range of technologies that are broader than just our core interconnect business and it really leverage our material science capability and are well-positioned for growth over the next several years.", "The third area or the second key area of our strategy of the three is to improve our operating leverage. As you know, two years ago, we talked about getting, over a three-year period operating margins up to 15%. Now that won't happen by 2010 because of what's going on, but we are making excellent progress on resizing the cost structure to get the operating leverage when the business does come back, and today we are on track to take about $300 million of costs out of the structure. What I mean by this is it is permanent cost savings, it's reduction in facilities, consolidation of comparable businesses, it is reducing spans and layers in organizations.", "We have made a lot of progress there and Terrence will take you through the details. About two-thirds of this savings will come from our manufacturing operations and one-third from SG&A. As we went through this program, keep three important things in mind; make sure we size this business to be solidly profitable in the $9.5 billion to $10 billion range. But as part of that, we really preserve our strategic opportunities and there are numerous strategic opportunities and when I say preserve them, I'm really talking about two key things, keep our strength in front of the customer and keep our engineering largely intact to develop a product that supports the customers' increasing needs.", "Then the third part of that is, as the business comes back, make sure we have accelerated spring back in our margins.", "And then the last part with respect to our strategy is focusing our portfolio. As you know, this has really been key for us to get down to what we consider the core business that we are best at. A couple weeks ago, we announced the sale of our Wireless Systems business for $675 million. We also closed on the sale of a small battery business during the quarter for $14 million and over the last 18 months, we have now divested five non-core businesses, which by the time the wireless sale closes in the June-July timeframe, will generate about $1.3 billion of total proceeds.", "And if you now can turn to slide 3, I will talk a little bit about cash flow and liquidity. We did have a very strong free cash flow quarter. We generated $382 million of free cash flow in Q2. This was an increase of 9% over the prior quarter. As you know, reducing our inventory was a very big focus area for us. We did get a bit of a slow start in Q1, but we're moving with great momentum in this area now and we reduced our inventory $326 million in the quarter and without sacrificing customer service levels.", "Through the first six months, we have now generated more than $400 million of free cash flow, excluding restructuring and this is putting us on pace to generate about $800 million of free cash flow for the full year before restructuring, consistent with what we said last quarter.", "With respect to our capital structure, this remains very solid with over $700 million of cash and another $600 million of net proceeds expected from the wireless sale when that closes.", "Then lastly, our plan to reincorporate in Switzerland from Bermuda is on track. This will be brought to our shareholders for approval in late June.", "So to recap this section, I feel very good about our progress we are making despite the fact we are in a lousy market. I believe we're strengthening our competitive position in a number of markets, high growth areas where we weren't as strong in the last couple of years; in markets where we are the leader like automotive, we are really focused on capitalizing on share gain opportunities.", "We are on track to take out $300 million of structural costs and this will be largely completed by the end of the fourth quarter. This will position us to be solidly profitable even at current business levels and enhances our operating leverage when business improves.", "Finally, with the wireless sale, our portfolio is essentially where we want it. So with that, I'll turn it over to Terrence who will walk you through the financials in more detail.", "Terrence Curtin", "Thanks, Tom and good morning, everyone. Let me start by reviewing our sales performance by segment and market and then I will review our earnings, cash flow and liquidity.", "So if you can turn to slide 4, this slide shows our overall revenue performance by segment. Overall, our total company sales were down 33% in the quarter or 28% on an organic basis. As you can see in the lower left hand corner of the slide, our business is serving the consumer markets, most of which are in the Components segment and to a lesser extent in the new Specialty Products segment, decreased 44% on an organic basis and these markets were the most affected by the economic slowdown.", "So let me turn to slide 5 and cover segment performance in more detail. Starting with our Electronic Components segment on the left hand side, our sales declined 45% in the quarter or 41% organically. The decline was broad-based across markets and geographies.", "On a regional basis, all three regions were down more than 35% year-over-year and we experienced declines in every major end market with the consumer-related markets, which are about 70% of the segment sales, declining 45% while the industrial and infrastructure markets that we serve were down 30%.", "Getting into specifics by the major markets in the segment. In the automotive market, our sales declined 49% organically, driven by an estimated 40% decline in global automotive production from 19 million units produced last year to approximately 11 million units in the current year quarter. We were also impacted by inventory corrections throughout the supply chain, which caused our sales decline to be higher than production levels.", "Geographically, all regions experienced a similar decline, and for quarter three, we do expect a sequential improvement in our sales driven by increased auto production outside of North America, as well as a reduction in the inventory burn-off in the supply chain.", "In the computer market, our sales declined 37% organically. This reflects a steep decline in desktop computers. Inventory levels in the supply chain appear to be clearing out and we expect a slight increase sequentially in our sales to this market.", "In the communications equipment market, our sales declined 29%, driven by 42% decline in mobile phones. That was impacted significantly by the supply chain inventory corrections during the quarter. Similar to the computer market, we believe that the supply chain inventory correction is substantially over.", "In the industrial equipment markets, our sales were down 37% on an organic basis and this market is being impacted by the global cutbacks in capital spending. We saw a continued weakening of order rates throughout Q2 in this area and we expect sales will be down sequentially in quarter three.", "Finally, in the distribution channel, our sales declined 31% organically due to weaknesses in the end-customer demand, as well as inventory reductions by distributors. We do expect a similar decline in the third quarter as distributors further reduce inventory levels.", "Looking at the right side of this slide, our Network Solutions segment, sales declined 22% on a reported basis and 11% organically. Sales to the energy market declined 8% organically in the quarter. Double-digit growth in North America was more than offset by declines in EMEA and Asia.", "In North America, we continue to gain share as a result of the revamping of our go-to-market structure, coupled with our expanded high-voltage product line. We do continue to see cutbacks in network investment by our utility customers and do not expect to see the typical season increase in sales in quarter three.", "Our sales to the service provider market also declined 8% organically. Selective investment in fiber-to-the-home and broadband wireless projects being more than offset by lower spending on upgrades and maintenance of existing networks and especially by the U.S. carriers.", "In the enterprise networks market, which we also referred to as building networks, our sales declined 22% organically. This reflects slower commercial construction markets, particularly in the U.S. and also deferred project spending due to IT budget cuts.", "Turning to slide 6, sales in the Specialty Products segment declined 21% year-over-year and 19% organically. Sales to the Aerospace, Defense and Marine market declined 12% organically, driven by inventory reductions in the distribution channel, as well as weakening demand in the commercial aerospace market. We do expect a similar decline in quarter three in this area.", "In our Touch System business, sales declined 24% due to delays in capital investment by our retail end customers.", "In the Medical area, product sales increased 4% due to strength in ultrasound and patient monitoring devices. We do expect lower business levels as hospitals' budgets get reduced, which will impact the sale of the devices in the equipment that our products are designed into.", "Finally, Circuit Protection sales declined 49%. Our sales were down due to declines in mobile phones and laptop computers, which were impacted by weak demand and supply chain inventory corrections.", "Moving to the right side of the slide, our undersea telecom sales increased 14% driven by progress on several projects underway in the Middle East, Africa and Southeast Asia. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion of backlog and now expect full year sales to exceed $1 billion compared to prior expectations of $900 million. We do, however, see sales declining sequentially to about $290 million.", "Finally, in our Wireless Systems segment, our sales grew 10% organically, driven by increased system deployments. We had very strong orders last quarter and our backlog in this segment grew 19% sequentially to nearly $400 million.", "So let me now get into the P&L, which begins on slide 7. Our GAAP operating loss was $3.8 billion and this was impacted by several items. First, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment of $3.5 billion and this impairment is due to the impact of the economic downturn on our businesses that serve computer-related markets.", "Specifically, $3.4 billion of the charge was in our Electronic Components segment where about 70% of our sales relate to consumer markets. The remaining $112 million impairment occurred in our Specialty Products segment and relates to our Circuit Protection business. We do not expect any further impairments unless business conditions significantly deteriorate further.", "Second, we did incur $196 million of restructuring costs during the quarter, which is a bit more than we guided. We initiated more headcount reductions and two additional plant closures. We also incurred a $6 million loss on the sale of the small battery business that Tom mentioned in our Electronic Components segment.", "I will cover more detail on the restructuring efforts as part of the cost action update in a minute.", "The final item on the slide relates to our separation from Tyco International. As you may recall, Tyco settled its major class action lawsuit about a year ago, but there were several smaller cases that were still outstanding. These cases are being managed by Tyco International, but we share 31% of the liability under the terms of our separation.", "During the second quarter, Tyco International settled two of the outstanding cases and established a reserve for the estimated costs to resolve the remaining cases. Our portion of the two settled cases was $19 million and our portion of the reserve for the remaining cases was $116 million. I want to note that this is the estimated cost to cover all remaining shareholder litigation items related to our separation.", "Now let's move to slide 8. Starting at the top, I want to talk about manufacturing margins first, and when I talk about manufacturing margins, this is our gross margin, excluding research, development and engineering costs. During the quarter, our manufacturing margin declined 700 basis points from 31% to 24%. The 33% decline in our sales reduced our manufacturing margin by 800 basis points.", "While our sales were down 33%, we also reduced production by approximately 50% compared to the prior year as we brought down our inventory levels. This lower level of production negatively impacted our manufacturing margin by 200 basis points. These production cuts will continue to be a drag on margins throughout the third quarter as we continue to reduce inventory. Offsetting these negative effects were our cost reduction efforts.", "If you look at the savings from our cost actions in quarter two versus a year ago, it was $110 million of cost savings, which did help our manufacturing margin by about 300 basis points.", "Looking at the middle of the slide on operating expenses and this includes both our RD&E expenses and SG&A as shown on the slide, we were down $73 million year on year. I do want to highlight the prior year SG&A amount includes a $36 million real estate gain on the sale that we had last year in the second quarter. If you take out the effects of this real estate gain, as well as currency translation, we reduced our operating expenses by $80 million through a combination of headcount reductions and spending controls.", "We have reduced our engineered expense at a slower rate than SG&A as we want to maintain our focus on growth investment. As Tom mentioned, we're seeing more growth opportunities in some end markets and we want to make sure we capitalize on these opportunities. We do expect that our RD&E and SG&A levels will be similar in Q3 as they were in Q2.", "Now let me provide you with an update on our cost-reduction efforts. As Tom highlighted earlier, our overall target is to remove approximately $300 million in annualized structural costs from our business. This consists of $200 million in manufacturing costs and another $100 million of SG&A and these actions will position us for solid profitability at the current sales levels and will also provide improved operating leverage as sales growth returns so that we can hit 12% operating margins at the $12 billion sales level.", "In addition to these structural reductions, we have also reduced our variable costs, excluding materials, by approximately $500 million on an annualized basis in response to the current demand environment. These reductions consist of a variety of items, which include shortened working weeks, the elimination of temporary workers and a significant reduction in discretionary spending.", "If you look at headcount, we have reduced our headcount by 21,000 since year-end and this is a 22% reduction. Sequentially, our headcount is down 13,000 from the first quarter. If you look at our manufacturing footprint, since we began our simplification program in 2007, we have closed 19 manufacturing sites and we have another six closures in process and by the end of the year, we will have less than 100 manufacturing sites.", "Overall, we continue to make very good progress on our cost-reduction efforts and with the exception of the plant closures, which do take longer to complete, the majority of our cost-reduction efforts will be completed by the end of the fourth quarter and this will position us for improved profitability in fiscal 2010.", "So let me turn to slide 9 and talk about items below operating income. Net interest expense in the quarter was $37 million and this was down slightly from the prior year due to lower debt levels. Favorable adjustments to our expected annual tax rate resulted in tax income of $25 million in the quarter. And as Tom mentioned, the amount and mix of income by jurisdiction have changed considerably since when we entered the year and this has resulted in a lower expected tax expense for the full year. And when you take the half-year adjustment that we have to book and our low income levels in Q2, this magnified the effect on the effective tax rate and actually caused it to go into an income position.", "In the Q3, we will also have an unusual tax rate, driven again by the low level of earnings and as you will see on the guidance slide coming up, we estimate that our tax expense will be between $12 million and $18 million, based on our operating income guidance range.", "The reason that this is fixed is, please recall that a portion of our tax expense is driven by the interest on our shared tax liabilities that relates to separation.", "If you look at other income, which was $3 million in the quarter, this was down from $13 million in the prior year that reflected lower-than-expected interest on the share tax liabilities due to some minor issues being resolved. This line will fluctuate with a corresponding increase or decrease and the interest running through our income tax line.", "For Q3, I expect the other income will be approximately $11 million.", "Now let me cover free cash flow on slide 10. Q2 free cash flow was $382 million. Lower income levels versus the prior year were more than offset by reductions in working capital and capital expenditures. Our days sales outstanding declined three days year over year and five days sequentially. Our inventory days on hand, excluding construction in process, were up four days year-over-year, but declined six days sequentially to 82 days on hand.", "As Tom stated, we reduced our inventory by $326 million in the quarter and we expect to take another $150 million to $200 million out in quarter three.", "On capital spending, we continue to manage capital tightly and if you go back, when we exited last year, we were running about $170 million per quarter in CapEx. This quarter was at $95 million, which is a 40% reduction from the prior year levels and we expect similar capital spending in quarter three and approximately $400 million of capital spending for the year.", "Cash restructuring in the quarter was $68 million. We expect full-year cash restructuring spending in the range of $300 million, up slightly from the previous guidance.", "Cash taxes were $10 million in the quarter and for the full year we continue to expect that our cash tax rate will be approximately 30% of our adjusted pretax income. This is slightly higher than our historical rate and is really due to payments we are making in the current year related to the prior year higher income levels.", "Finally, as Tom mentioned, we remain on track to generate approximately $800 million in free cash flow for the year before restructuring cash.", "Moving to slide 11, which shows our debt and liquidity position. We began the quarter with $545 million of cash and ended it with $722 million of cash. During the quarter, we paid down just under $100 million on our credit facility and at quarter-end, our debt was $2.9 billion, down from $3.2 billion last year.", "Our debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA as measured in our credit facility agreement is now 1.5 times and our liquidity position remains solid with no significant debt due until 2012. Our liquidity position will be further [strengthened] by the proceeds from our Wireless Systems business, which will be about $615 million after tax and transaction costs.", "Based upon our cash generation from operations and solid liquidity position, we are committed to the current dividend levels for fiscal 2009. As we do every year, we will review our dividend and payout ratio with our Board as we enter into fiscal 2010.", "Now let me turn the call back over to Tom.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks, Terrence. I'm now going to move to slide 12, which is our Q3 outlook. And please note that the outlook for Q3 does exclude our Wireless Systems business, as we will now be reporting that as a discontinued operation.", "For Q3, we expect our sales will be in the range of $2.35 billion to $2.45 billion, which is flat to slightly higher than Q2, but down 30% to 33% year over year on an organic basis. Last year's third quarter was really the high watermark and after that, that is when the business really began to deteriorate. So it is one of our hardest compares I would say, but business is still weak out there. As I mentioned earlier, in our consumer-related businesses, we expect sequential improvement in the 8% to 10% range while we would expect industrial to be down 5% to 7% and automotive will be low double digits is what we are expecting right now and based on the order rates we are seeing.", "We expect our adjusted operating income to be in the range of $40 million to $70 million and this is down a little bit from Q2 due to the continued impact of our inventory reduction efforts on our profitability. Q3 is definitely where the biggest impact of the production cuts is being felt, some impact in Q2, large impacts in Q3. We do expect this will be another 100 to 200 basis points worse impact than it was in Q2, but if sales continue to stabilize or slightly improve, we expect by the end of the third quarter inventory levels will largely be in line with our sales levels although, for sure, we are not taking our foot off the gas on reducing inventory.", "We expect our adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations will be in the $0.01 to $0.06 range. Terrence mentioned a little bit of this range, spread is due to the range of the tax rate. Now if you move to slide 13, I will wrap it up before we open it up for Q&A.", "To sort of just recap everything we just covered, business is still low. I mean business levels are still low; there is no question about that. But for the first time in a while, we are seeing some signs of improvement and that is largely in our consumer-related markets and importantly in our largest market, automotive. We do feel like we are positioning the Company soundly and solidly for accelerated growth. As Terrence mentioned, we have not reduced our engineering spending that much. We are looking at ways to be efficient and eliminate duplication, but we are very focused there because the leverage on engineering in this Company is very, very high in terms of revenue to engineering dollars and the number of new projects that we do in a business like this.", "I feel good about the portfolio and the product with the changes we have made. Terrence took you through the cost program, which has very good traction, good solid second quarter and cash flow and we expect to be solid for the second half of the year as well and generate over $800 million of free cash flow before restructuring. And then finally, we have a very solid capital structure and that is going to get stronger with the closure of the wireless divestiture. So with that, operator, can we please open it up for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Just on the consumer side, right, from your comments and I think from a lot of other component companies, definitely sounds like we are starting to see stability and some inventory build, rebuild. But on the other side, you guys are talking about a 10% sequential growth. Now is that really a reflection of demand getting better or are you just seeing some possible pull-ins due to one-time benefits from the Scrappage Laws in Europe for example?", "Tom Lynch", "Amit, all of that is in Europe and Asia. None of that is happening in the US yet and it is more from inventory. A lot of governments have a variety of different, say, stimulus programs to encourage people, whether it is the scrapping of the old car, credits for new purchases. I don't think we have seen that really begin to hit in any significant way yet. I mean it remains to be seen how significant that will be, but clearly everybody slams on the brakes in inventory four or five months and that is finally getting to a point where there is just not enough inventory in the pipeline. So I would say it is more inventory right now.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Then just on the inventory aspect, and you guys actually did a pretty good job I think of lowering it and it was down 20% or so year-over-year. Your sales are still down 30%, so do we still take it that there is actually room for cash generation to be positive as we work down further inventory in the June quarter? Is that reasonable?", "Terrence Curtin", "It will depend on how much inventory we do take out, but from that viewpoint, if you look at that $200 million, cash could be positive from a free cash flow perspective. We do have our interest payment in this quarter, which are semi-annual, which does create a little bit of a drag, but there definitely is potential for that.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Then just finally from me, the Electronic Component business, what sort of revenue run rate could we see that business start to break even?", "Terrence Curtin", "If you look at components, certainly the margin impact of the inventory drag is the largest in components. That is the one that has had the most impact, obviously top line, which is where the inventory actions are there. So, when you look at it, the inventory is creating the loss you have seen there, as well as will create the loss to slightly go up sequentially as we continue to work through inventory.", "If you look at the cost actions and so forth, we would have to be higher than the levels are today, but it will depend upon the mix of revenue between the various businesses in there. So, from that viewpoint, the inventory burn is having a big impact there, but it will depend upon where business levels are between the businesses that are in there.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "But it definitely sounds like you need more than just cost savings, right, to drive that and to break even a positive territory.", "Terrence Curtin", "Between the cost savings and the inventory and a slight improvement in revenue, we would be close to breakeven.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Brian White of Collins Stewart.", "Brian White - Collins Stewart", "Just on the inventory frontier, if sales were pretty much in line with what you thought, why do we have so much excess inventory going into the June quarter?", "Tom Lynch", "Can you repeat the last part of that question?", "Brian White - Collins Stewart", "It seems like sales are what you expected in the March quarter and a little bit of a growth here in the June quarter sequentially, so I'm just wondering why do we have so much excess inventory?", "Terrence Curtin", "Brian, when you look at it and I'll go back to the last call, when you look at our inventory, we did state that we had higher-than-normal levels and it would take us multiple quarters to work that off as you are aware. Inventory, by the various industries, you can't switch between the industries. So we set a target out to get about $200 million out in quarter two. We drove that at a higher level at $326 million and our goal is to get it behind us by the end of Q3. So our goal has always been that this would be a multi-quarter process to work through and we exceeded the target that we actually set out here for Q2.", "John Roselli", "And another way to think about that, Brian, this is John, if you look at where we ended last year, we had around $2.1 billion of inventory. If you think about a $10 billion sales run rate, that is down about 30%. So, if you drop our inventory levels by 30%, that is roughly where we need to get our inventory to be in line with our sales run rate and we're not quite there yet.", "Brian White - Collins Stewart", "Okay, it looks to me, I mean just looking at inventory to revenue throughout '08, you are at a mid-60% type level that maybe you would have more like 350 to 400 excess inventory, but you think it is 150 to 200.", "Terrence Curtin", "It is slightly above 200, if you look at that. It is not 350 to 400. Right now, if you look at the metric, we are around 82 days. We typically like to be in the 70s. So when you look at it, it is not as big of a number as you have. But to Tom's point, in these uncertain times, we are going to take it down as far as we can basically to make sure we get the most out of cash generation as well.", "Tom Lynch", "And also, Brian, I would say over time I believe we can run the inventory at less than the 70 days range. We are doing a lot from a process point of view. Probably if you were to say in your reductions this year, 80% is more of in the brute force category, you know, you just stop the press for this kind of thing. But we are making a lot of process improvement and I think one of the real opportunities for this company that we are very focused on is to run the business with less inventory, at the same time improve our delivery rate. So that is a key focus area.", "Brian White - Collins Stewart", "And just on the auto front, have some of your customers come to you and asked for better pricing in the auto component area?", "Tom Lynch", "I would say not any more than usual. And what I mean by that is, there is always the pricing negotiations going on. To give you an example though, of that $150 million of additional business we bid on, a fair amount of that business we lost because of the price in the past. We didn't just all of a sudden change our price threshold to get it. Our point has been, we continue to invest. We have dedicated engineers; you can count on us; we are going to keep that. So far we have not seen any real change in price erosion across, and our position has been, volumes are down 30% below when we bid these jobs. So we understand everybody would like lower prices, but so far that is holding the day, and I think it is a good argument for us.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin of Thomas Weisel.", "Matt Sheerin - Thomas Weisel", "Back to the gross margin on your expectations past the June quarter, we understand the impact of the inventory reduction on gross margin this quarter. In fact, it sounds like it is going to be down again a little bit. But you also talked about, I think, the 200 basis point improvement when you get back to production levels. So is that what we should be thinking about, about whether it be September or December, the gross margin up a couple of points or so?", "Terrence Curtin", "Yes. When you look at it, right now certainly the manufacturing margin, I'm going to take out the engineering because that is leverage that is in there. But if you look at the manufacturing margin, you are thinking about it right. At this level, manufacturing margin we would expect to be in the 26%, 27% range, manufacturing margin once we work through all of this, including just the impacts of the cost savings.", "Matt Sheerin - Thomas Weisel", "Okay. And then on the cash situation, could you just talk about what your short-term plans are for the cash in addition to, obviously, the requirements that you have with the restructuring charges and other things? Do we plan to take down the credit line more than you have now? I think you took it down $100 million this quarter.", "Terrence Curtin", "Yes. Similar to what we said last quarter, we are not repurchasing shares. Right now, we are going to hold excess capital to provide flexibility around the balance sheet. We do have about $340 million outstanding on the revolver. And really what we will do is right now protect the balance sheet from a liquidity perspective, and there could be further debt reductions, especially when we get into the proceeds off the wireless sale.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jim Suva of Citi.", "Jim Suva - Citi", "I believe your financial goals were $12 billion in sales, 12% margins and $2 of EPS, coupled with a dividend payout of 20% to 25% of the EPS. Can you address that because it seems like we are pretty far from that EPS level and the dividend payout of 20% to 25%? I know you are committed for the next quarter or two, but should we expect that payout ratio and that financial goal timeline what we are looking at or do we need to adjust it accordingly now that there are so many acquisition or divestitures that are finished?", "Tom Lynch", "A couple things I would say. When we talked about the 12 at 12%, it is really to kind of give you a sense of what we are doing with the cost structure to drive the operating leverage. As I mentioned in my comments, when we looked at this program, make sure we draw the right balance, first and foremost, be financially solid at 10, the current run rate.", "With all the actions we have largely in place, I feel like we are there. That gives us the leverage then as we go from 10 to 12 to really see the operating leverage come through, which has been something, as you know, as we have talked over the past couple of years, has not been a strong suit of the company. It is something we are extremely focused on up and down in this company to get the operating leverage that I believe is inherent in the company. That would then translate to when $12 billion comes, and I guess that is probably a couple years out based on today's circumstances. But that would translate into roughly a $2 EPS.", "And then with respect to the dividend, we think the right level traditionally -- and I'm going back to 25% to 30% based on the kind of company we are, we committed six months ago to a dividend level; we are sticking with it. We have the cash to do it and with our Board, this is always the main topic of our August-September Board meeting, which is, what is your business plan for the next three to five years, let's go through the operating plan for this year and then we work through with the Board's approval what we think the appropriate dividend is.", "So that is really where we are. We are committed to the May and August dividend at $0.16 a share and the current rate and then take a look at that, which is our MO for our planning process.", "Jim Suva - Citi", "And as a quick follow-up on the wireless divestiture, are there any remaining liabilities left from that specifically related to what is remaining or the New York state contract, which didn't go as optimal as planned? How should we think about any residual impact?", "Tom Lynch", "Well, we clearly retain that liability. As you know, we wrote off about $110 million last quarter, of which $50 million was related to the drawdown by the letter of credit. We have filed affectively suit in the New York Claims Court. We like our position very much. This system that the state decided to discontinue is up and running in other places around the country as advertised.", "So I don't believe we have any material exposure beyond what we have recorded. I mean this has to play out, but we're going after this in an aggressive way because we believe that we delivered the system that we signed up to deliver. That would be the major liability.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of William Stein of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "William Stein - Credit Suisse", "Thanks. First, just a small follow-up on Jim's question. At the $12 billion revenue run rate and 12% operating margin, do you guys have a target operating and free cash flow level?", "Terrence Curtin", "It would continue to be. As we said historically, we would expect our free cash flow will approximate net income. That has not changed.", "William Stein - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Then about the plant closures, that's the last of the real restructuring that's still left. I assume the 12%, $12 billion relates to when the plant or the manufacturing restructuring is done. Is that correct and what is the current view on timing of finishing the manufacturing footprint adjustment and what would it look like in terms of number of plants?", "Tom Lynch", "Yes, you are correct and I will go back in time a couple years when we laid out the plan, which was to get us from about 123 plants, south of 100. We are tracking right to that. I think Terrence mentioned 19 finished, six in progress. If you go back to that original plan, that is really tracking very well to the original plan.", "So that is an important part of the $300 million that we talked about $150 million to $175 million annual savings from that, about a three-year payback on the investment. Since then, we have identified some additional fixed costs to take out of manufacturing, plus the $100 million in SG&A. So that is how you get to the $300 million. So we are largely through that. We don't have to start any new plants to hit that number. We have to finish off these six that are well underway now.", "William Stein - Credit Suisse", "When is the plan to finish those?", "Tom Lynch", "That will be in early to mid 2010, which is in line with the original plan. We said that program would be finished about then and that is where we are headed.", "William Stein - Credit Suisse", "Great. And one other one if I can. I was just kind of surprised to hear you talk about new opportunities in automotive. I think you mentioned $150 million new opportunities that you are bidding on. I would imagine that is with one of the big U.S. [ODEs] because it is where you have been less strong. I'm wondering what the strategy is around that. Why is this a new focus?", "Tom Lynch", "It is more than U.S. Some of the shakeout in the supplier base applies globally and by the way, anything that is US-related is taken with great care, but it is much more than U.S. Clearly, automotive is in tough straits right now and our business is in tough straits, but the dynamics in the business or the characteristics of the business are still fundamentally sound. And if you look at almost any automaker and particularly the European automakers and the Asian automakers, their three fundamental focuses are safe, green and connected. That is all electronics-driven. I mean that is all electronics-enabled I should say.", "As we've said before I believe, if you talk about alternative energy engines, whether they be all electric or hybrid vehicles, there is a lot more electronic content in that, which means there is more of our content. So while things are very tough when the production is down 40% in the second quarter of number of vehicles, the trends there aren't changing and we are the leader in the industry and it is not an easy industry to get into because quality, track record, the ability to invest. I mean most of where we spend our engineering dollars today is two to four years out on the next generation of vehicles.", "So it's still an important part of our strategy. From the beginning, two years ago, we said the most important part of our restructuring strategy is to significantly reduce our fixed cost base in that business. That is on track. It's being overwhelmed by the volume decline. But keep it as healthy as possible in the short term and take the costs out, be selective on where we want to grow and by the way, we are discontinuing some product lines too. We are phasing out product lines that aren't in our sweet spot.", "It's really strengthening the mix of the business within automotive that we're focused on and being very, very selective of chasing North America.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Shawn Harrison of Longbow Research. Please go ahead.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Just a follow-up on the restructuring question. By my math, it looks like there is about $150 million of fixed costs that have been removed here to date. The remaining of the manufacturing saves I'm guessing are going to be very back-end loaded until the facilities close, if that is correct. Just wondering about the timing of the additional OpEx savings, how we should see those role on?", "Terrence Curtin", "OpEx savings, for the most part when you say OpEx, I'm talking RD&E and SG&A. They are in, so we were able to execute those quicker, Shawn. So that $100 million structural, that is in place and I think you saw our SG&A this quarter actually came in lower than we guided last quarter based upon executing on those moves quicker.", "Footprint, definitely as Tom said, on the six factories that are still in process. Some of those will go into early next year, middle of next year, but the bulk of it is in place.", "Tom Lynch", "You are in the ballpark on your estimate though there.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Okay, and then the other side of that, the $500 million in variable costs that have been removed to date, how should we expect those to come back as demand eventually recovers? I'm expecting it to be very gradual, but maybe if you could just kind of give me some idea of how to maybe model that as we look out into 2010 or 2011 if demand comes back, just to think about that dynamic.", "Tom Lynch", "The way I would think about it is some of it is definitely going to come back because it is in the categories of where there has been a freeze on raises, elimination or in most cases elimination of bonuses, extreme cutbacks on discretionary travel, anything like that. So you swing the pendulum very far as is needed. I would think about it this way, kind of the first billion dollars in revenue back, you would expect a couple hundred million of that to come and then a little bit less because in order to remain competitive in certain areas, you'll need to give some raises and things like that.", "I mean we have a very tight fist around that $500 million. Right now, it's managed literally daily across our business. So it would gradually flow back and we want to keep out as much as we can frankly. When we talk around our targets now, we're talking around $300 million permanent, but it wouldn't be at all back in until you get to well north of $12 billion in revenue.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Okay. And then just I guess two final quick questions. Raw material costs, I know that you're still working through some of the higher priced purchases made back in the latter part of calendar '08. As those roll off, what should we expect to see any P&L benefit in 2010?", "Then just on the Network Solutions business, I want to just get a clarification. It sounds like you are saying you are not going to see any type of seasonal uptick here in the June quarter or did I hear that incorrectly?", "Terrence Curtin", "First, on metals, you are right on how you have it. Inventory reduction that we are in the middle of and on the fixing we did at the end of last year, it is taking us longer to work through the fixing than we anticipated in the first and second quarter. So right now, we are still buying copper in the mid-to high 2s for when we do procure it. We are not buying a lot right now as we work through it.", "So as you look at it, as you go into next year, if we stay at these types of levels, we would only probably buy 130 million pounds of copper. You can separate the price on that from mid to high 2s versus a market price and multiply it by the volume. And like we've said, we would anticipate about half of that may have to come back through pricing when we did raise it, but I think that's the way you think about it.", "On Network Solutions, typically you are right and in the comments I made. Our utility business where we serve in the energy market, as well as the service provider side, we typically get a summer increase because of weather being better. Right now, with where capital spending are in those markets, we would expect that to really be flat sequentially.", "Tom Lynch", "Let me just add a little bit to that. I would say that is what we see right now in our order rate. If you take the other two parts of the network, our telecom plant business, the part of that business that is growing is the carriers around the world deploying fiber networks. And as you have seen the last three years, that tends to be lumpy. We really have a very nice product line there and have strengthened our share in the U.S. and our strongest base is in Europe.", "That continues to be a little bit of a lumpy business, but it doesn't tie directly to economics. And then I would say thirdly in our enterprise or our building networks business, we are starting to see a little bit of a flattening out of the decline, which we had expected.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of [Steven Fox] of CLSA. Please go ahead.", "Steven Fox - CLSA", "I guess just going back over the auto business a little, you mentioned the sharp decline in auto production worldwide since a year ago. Were you guys rightsizing the business? If you talked about the 19 million units going down to 11 million, where, in your mind, do you need to get your own production to match up against expected demand over the next few years?", "And then just secondly, what is the implications for the margins in the auto business? Is there any permanent impairment that we need to worry about?", "Terrence Curtin", "First off on production, Steve, we did go down to 11 million units. If you look at that and you annualize that that would be 44 million units of annual car production. We don't believe that that is the right level. So where we have been sizing the business right now is that that comes back to about a 60 million unit level versus the 73 million we had last year.", "So when you do look at it, we are sizing it for around a 60 million unit production level. And it is all for us to see when does that come back. Certainly we have lost a little bit of leverage in our automotive business going from 73 million to 60 million, that's why we are taking the costs out. Margin will be slightly less than where we have run historically, but that is built into the 12% at $12 billion model that Tom covered.", "Operator", "Then the final question comes from the line of Amitabh Passi of UBS. Please go ahead.", "Amitabh Passi - UBS", "Just had a couple of quick ones. My first one had to do with the automotive business too. There's a lot of excitement around the scrappage incentives in Europe and what not. Just wanted to get your perspective. A, do you have any concerns that we are probably seeing some level of demand being pulled in and what do you think the potential ramifications are further down the road?", "And B, it seems like most of the increased volumes we have seen have been in smaller model cars. I'm just wondering how you sort of think about that in terms of your dollar content and potentially maybe incremental pricing pressures in these models?", "Tom Lynch", "Sure. So three things. I think what we are seeing in our business pickup is still more related to inventory correction. Most of the European and Asian automakers are just starting to increase production now or have plans to increase in May. So I don't think we have seen too much impact from a change in demand. We are not counting on it. I mean we are hopeful that it is going to happen, but it is not changing how we run the business.", "We are assuming that inventory gets corrected and this is going to last for a while. Our marching orders continue to take the structure down and continue to focus on attractive new programs and be flexible to respond when it comes. I think we are seeing the ability to do that in the third quarter as it evolves.", "Could you tell me the second part of your question again?", "Amitabh Passi - UBS", "The second part was just it seems like most of the incremental volumes have been in what appeared to be smaller makes, smaller model cars.", "Tom Lynch", "I think that is definitely the case and electronic content is lower in that case, but relatively, it is still on the newer cars that come out of a similar, let's say, category, small car, midsize. There is more content because there is more airbags, there is the move in Asia and U.S. with (inaudible) brakes and I should say vehicle stability systems. There is more entertainment. The entertainment systems are moving from high-end options to more standard in some cases. But no question, a high-end vehicle has more content than a midsize or low end.", "So that is a little bit of pressure. We view that as more of a short-term thing because the whole history is people like to move up in cars. So we don't think that dynamic is going to change and it may be this way for a period of time for sure. Like I said, the way we are thinking about and the way we are managing the businesses, not assuming a recovery, being ready for one, but most importantly continuing to lower the cost structure so we can have an attractive business at much lower revenue.", "Amitabh Passi - UBS", "Then just very quickly on your industrial markets, particularly some of the so-called late cycle markets, including your exposure to non-res construction. Do you have any concerns that we might actually see sort of a prolonged period of weakness in your industrial sort of segment? And then just wondering as the mix shifts, assuming consumer does relatively better, industrial maybe slightly worse, does that have any meaningful impact on your margins?", "Tom Lynch", "It puts a little pressure on the margins because generally the industrial margins are higher and they are more custom in nature, the products. We are concerned. The industrial markets are definitely lagging and this typically happens in the consumer markets. So I think there will be a lag effect on recovery. As we indicated, we expect industrial to be down in kind of 5% to 7% range sequentially in the third quarter.", "Amitabh Passi - UBS", "just my final question and maybe this is for Terrence. If we were to normalize for the adverse impact on margins from your inventory work-down, assuming we get back to sort of \"more normalized margins\". As demand recurs and revenues grow, how do we think about incremental operating margins? I mean is it roughly in the 20%, 25% range as revenues sort of grow?", "Terrence Curtin", "I think as Tom mentioned, early on, it should be higher because of the cost actions we have had, so I think you will be higher than that rate. I think once you hit the run rate, up above $12 billion, you will probably be in that range both early on because of the temporary actions we have and the suppression we want to keep on these lower levels, it should be higher than that.", "Operator", "Back to you, gentlemen.", "John Roselli", "Thank you, everyone for taking the time and Keith Kolstrom and myself will be around all day to take any follow-up questions you may have. Thanks, everyone.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be made available for replay after 10:30 am today until May 6 at midnight.

And welcome the Tyco Electronics reports strong First Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. John Roselli. Please go ahead, sir.", "John M. Roselli - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thanks, Ken. Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Tyco Electronics' first quarter results for fiscal year 2008, and the press release issued earlier this morning.", "With me today is our Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch; and our Chief Financial Officer, Terrence Curtin.", "During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask you to look at today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary statement that we have included there.", "In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions this morning and we ask you to read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. The press release and all the related tables can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at tycoelectronics.com.", "Now, let me turn the call over to Tom for some opening comments and a review or our performance by end-market. Tom?", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks John and good morning everyone. I am very happy with the start we got in the first quarter of our fiscal year. Overall, I think we had a very good performance this quarter. And this performance really reflects very much the strength of the diverse markets we serve, the leadership position we have in most of those markets. And very importantly, our strong international base, which right now is about two-thirds of our revenue and that\u2019s more than offset our weakness in the U.S. that we've been seeing for the last year and we'll talk more about that as I get into the details.", "Let me now share a little bit about our business segment performance and our performance within key markets in those segments and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Terrence who will take us through our P&L and cash flow in more detail.", "Our total sales grew 19% to $3.7 billion in quarter, with organic sales growth of 12%. This organic growth was driven by over 300% growth in our Undersea business which continued to be very hot, along with double digit growth in Network Solutions segment. Our largest segment, Electronic Components grew 5% organically in the quarter, due to continued strength in out international markets where our sales grew 7%. This more than offset a 2% decline in the U.S. and as I said earlier that\u2019s the situation we've been seeing for about the last three or four quarters.", "Our adjusted operating margin of 13.6% increased 50 basis points over the prior year. This increase was driven by higher margins in our Network Solutions and Undersea segment As you know, this is one of our key goals to get our margins over 15% over the next three years, and we made some good progress in the quarter, still a lot more to\u2026 work to do here, but overall, I am pleased with our progress.", "Our adjusted earnings per share of $0.63 increased 26% over the prior year due to 23% growth in adjusted operating income led by our Components Networks and Undersea segment. We also had another strong cash flow performance quarter. We generated $392 million of operating cash flow, which is an increase of 84% over last year and our free cash flow is $267 million in the quarter. Most of this increase came from improvements in working capital and our higher income level.", "As we previously communicated, our plan is to return excess cash to our shareholders, and during the quarter, we took a major step as we repurchased over 7 million of our shares. We also finished the quarter very strong with over $900 million of cash in our balance sheet. And Terrence will talk a lot more in detail about that.", "Importantly, we made progress in two key strategic areas in the quarter. One in our manufacturing simplification area, we currently have over 20\u2026 about 20 actions in process and we incurred about $20 million\u2026 $21 million on restructuring activity. We continue to expect that we\u2019ll spend about $130 million on the footprint restructuring this year. This is very, very important to our longer term margin goals and I feel we are tracking according to what we expect it to be. We also made good progress in our efforts to focus our portfolio. We closed the sale of our Power Systems business as we announced earlier, and we initiated the exit of three additional small product lines. We are also continuing to work on other transactions, which can\u2019t talk about any details at this time, but we will certainly share them as the appropriate time comes up.", "Now, let me talk about our performance in several key end-markets in the quarter. Starting with Electronic Components, our sales grew 10% in the quarter or 5% organically, and by region, the sales growth was 9% in Asia and 4% in Europe, again, offsetting a slight decline in the Americas. We had a strong quarter in automotive, growing 17% overall and 8% organically which was entirely driven by our business outside the U.S. and this is where we have our greatest strength. We had solid double digit growth in Asia at 14% and in China, we grew more than 30%.", "We also had a very strong quarter in Europe, with 9% organic growth. In the U.S., our sales were down 8% in the quarter, reflecting the continued weakness in this segment of the market that we have been experiencing for about the past two years. Our order rates for this business remain solid overall, but we do expect slower growth in the second quarter and this is consistent with the current global production forecast for automotive output.", "In the computer market, our sales declined 5% as a result of our continued efforts to prune low margin products. Sales of these products were approximately $30 million in the year ago quarter. Excluding this pruning, our sales were up 6%, driven by strengthening in the notebook computer markets.", "In the communications equipment market, we had a very good quarter with sales growth of 22% organically. In the infrastructure portion of the market which represents about 60% of our business in this market. Sales grew 11%, and again, most of this growth was in Asia which is offsetting continued softness in North America and Europe, same trend we have seen for the last few quarters.", "In the mobile phone market which is about 40% of the segment\u2026 for this market segment sales. Our sales grew 47% and this was led by 66% growth for our interconnect products. We do believe we are gaining market share in this very important market as we expand our base of customers and broaden our product portfolio, and we expect another very strong year for this business.", "In our industrial markets, we grew 10%, with a very strong growth in the solar and oil and gas sub-segments of this market. In appliances, our sales declined 4% year-over-year, with double digit declines in the U.S. and Europe, partially offset by a solid growth in Asia. This continues to be a challenging market, especially in the U.S. as a result of the U.S. housing situation, and we don\u2019t expect this to change for the balance of the year.", "We also had another strong quarter in the aerospace and defense market with organic growth of 9% in the quarter. We continue to build backlog in this market and expect continued strong sales growth for the balance of the year.", "I will now talk a little bit about our Network Solutions segment where sales grew 22% on a reported basis and 12% organically. In the communications service provider market, sales were up 22% organically with growth in all regions, especially in the U.S. This growth was driven by increased spending on broadband fiber deployment by certain large carriers. And as you know, in this market, our revenue is driven by carrier capital programs and they tend to be a little bit uneven. And in the second quarter, we did expect lower sales sequentially due solely to the timing of project revenues from certain European carriers. But overall, we expect the strong year-to-year driven by continued fiber optic rollout to demand for broadband is very strong.", "In the building networks market, this business segment, growth was 10%. This business continues to be strong fueled by continued global demand as businesses upgrade their information technology to support broadband in more secure networks. The majority of this volume was driven outside the U.S. and pricing was relatively flat in the quarter, so this 10% was all volume related.", "In our energy market, sales grew 8% in the quarter, again, driven by strength outside the U.S. As you know utility companies continued to invest in energy infrastructure around the world, and we believe we are well positioned to benefit from that trend.", "In our Undersea Telecommunications segment, we had another outstanding quarter, with 311% growth driven by the construction of several large projects in Asia. Activity in this market remained very robust, especially in emerging markets where broadband requirements continued to increase. We are well positioned there and we are winning more than our fair share of this business. And in the quarter, we booked $750 million of new projects. And we ended the quarter with a backlog of about $1 billion.", "Finally, in our wireless system segment, sales were flat in the quarter, with growth in wireless networks offset by declines in the commercial products and aerospace and defense businesses.", "Now, let me just say a few things about the state of New York project which is a big project in the wireless system segment and in particular in the wireless networks business, portion of that business. As you know, we were awarded this project a couple of years ago. It\u2019s a very large product\u2026 project. And we are well into the testing in the first two phases of that region\u2026 of the State, the first two regions I should say. And right now, we expect that it will start recording revenue in the second half of the year.", "Now, let me turn the call over to Terrence.", "Terrence R. Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Tom and good morning everyone. Since Tom covered all revenue trends, I\u2019ll go through the P&L, cash flow, and a few other items.", "Starting with the P&L, our operating margin on a GAAP basis was 13% which includes $21 million of restructuring costs. On an adjusted basis we were pleased to see our operating margin improve by 50 basis points to 13.6% in the quarter. We saw good operating leverage on higher sales levels in the Network Solutions and Undersea Telecommunications segments. This was partially offset by a slight margin decline in the Electronic Component segment, reflecting a continuation of the low productivity levels we have been experiencing in our U.S. automotive operations. As you are aware, we were doing a plant consolidation in the U.S. and we worked through the final stages of that in the quarter, and we expect improved performance in our U.S. automotive operations going forward.", "Next, out net interest expense was $40 million in the quarter, a slight decrease versus last year, reflecting lower debt levels and a higher cash balance. Depending on the level of cash generation coupled with the timing of our share repurchase program, our net interest expense should be in the range of $40 million to $50 million per quarter.", "Our other income was $592 million on a GAAP basis and $20 million on an adjusted basis during the quarter. Both of these figures relate to our tax sharing agreement with Tyco International and Covidien and we were impacted by the adoption of a new accounting standard which I will discuss in a minute.", "Income tax expense in the quarter was $157 million resulting in a GAAP effective tax rate of 15%. This slow rate reflects the non-taxable nature of the tax sharing income included in other income. Our tax rate on an adjusted pretax income was 34% and this effective rate was reduced by about $15 million due to non-recurring items in the quarter.", "Now, let me spend a few minutes on the adoption of FIN 48, the accounting for uncertainty and income taxes. This standard requires us to take a more conservative view of our potential tax liabilities for which the majority relates to the shared obligations with Tyco International and Covidien under our tax sharing agreement. The adoption of this standard resulted in an increase to our contingent tax liabilities and deferred tax assets, and this resulted in a one-time increase to our net tax liabilities of $635 million. We also recorded a one-time income item of $572 million and other income to reflect the shared portion of these liabilities for which we will be reimbursed from Tyco International and Covidien. The net impact of these items together to our shareholders equity was a decrease of $63 million.", "In addition to the one-time adjustments, the adoption of FIN 48 will result in an ongoing impact to our income tax expense and effective tax rate, as well as other income. The interest on the increase contingent tax liabilities, which we reflect as a component of our income tax expense will add approximately $80 million to our income tax expense and will increase our effective rate to 36% to 37% for the year compared to our previous guidance to Europe 33% to 34%. Our other income will also increase to $23 million per quarter versus our prior guidance to Europe $10 million per quarter. Again, the impact of other income reflects the shared portion of the interest accrued through our tax line under the tax sharing agreement. The increase in our income tax expense of $80 million less the increase in other income, results in a $0.05 decrease to our EPS versus our prior guidance. It\u2019s important to highlight that, while these adjustments will affect our reporting earnings, it is important to note that these are non-cash items.", "In the quarter, our cash tax rate on an adjusted income basis was 17% and should remain below 20% for the full year. As I previously indicated, we are working on initiatives to reduce our tax rate by two to three points over the next several years, but the base well be now higher due to the adoption of FIN 48.", "Turning to net income. Net income from continuing operations was $872 million in the quarter and our EPS was $1.75 per diluted share on a GAAP basis. Our adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.63 per share, an increase of 26 over the prior year and as Tom indicated, this was driven primarily by increased operating income in our businesses.", "Moving now to cash flow. We had a very nice start to the year with cash from continuing operations of $392 million, an increase of $179 million compared to last year\u2019s first quarter. The improvement was driven by higher income levels and improved working capital performance. Our inventory levels on a year-over-year were down nine days and we feel good with where our inventory levels are going into the remainder of the year.", "Our net capital expenditures were $125 million in the quarter, which is down significantly versus last year. Recall that in last year\u2019s first quarter we spent $280 million to buyout a lease for ships related to our Undersea Telecom segment.", "Next as Tom mentioned during the quarter, we repurchased 7.1 million shares for $259 million. Based on our current level of cash generation and current pace of repurchases, I expect that we\u2019ll complete this program in the next few months.", "And finally, we completed the sale of the Power Systems business during the quarter for $102 million and recorded a $56 million pretax gain on the sale and this gain is included in the income from discontinued operations.", "And with that, I will turn the call back over to Tom.", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Terrence. I am now going to talk about our outlook for the balance of the year in the second quarter.", "In Q1, we had strong order rates with growth of 17% for the total Company and 9% excluding our Undersea Telecom and Wireless segment. The strength in the orders was broad based, with the exception of our U.S. components business which I mentioned earlier where orders were relatively flat compared to the prior year. Since the end of the quarter, our order rates have continued to be solid, reflecting a similar pattern for the first quarter whilst it\u2019s clear that these are uncertain economic time other than the weaknesses we have been experiencing in the U.S. for about a year now. The balance of our business continues to be solid.", "Based on these factors, we are raising our full year outlook for adjusted earnings per share to a range of $2.45 to $2.55, an increase of 12% to 17% over last year. This compares to our previous guidance of $2.40 per share to $2.50 per share. The increased results from our strong first quarter results and the continued momentum of our Undersea Telecom business which is offsetting a $0.05 per share impact from the adoption of FIN 48 that Terrence discussed.", "Our outlook for other businesses in aggregate is really essentially unchanged from our prior guidance and our estimate of restructuring cost is still approximately $130 million or $0.17 per share for the full year. We expect full year sales growth of 11% to 13% and we now expect full year organic sales growth of 7% to 9% compared to our previous yield of 6% to 8%. And just as a reminder, our guidance does not take into account any divestiture activity and assumes that raw material prices and foreign exchange rates hold at current levels.", "For the second quarter, we expect sales growth of 10% to 12% over prior year sales of $3.3 billion, with organic sales growth of 5% to 7% and double digit operating income growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.60 to $0.62 and this is essentially flat with the prior year. Our flat EPS is due entirely to a significantly lower tax rate last year and this adversely affects the year-over-year comparison by approximately $0.07 per share. Restructuring costs are expected to be approximately $0.03 per share in the second quarter and including these costs earnings per share from continuing operations are expected to be $0.57 to $0.59 per share.", "So, before I open it up for Q&A, let me just recap the call. We are pleased with the start to the year with organic growth 12%, adjusted operating income up 23%, and adjusted EPS up 26%. Our operating margins were up 50 basis points year-over-year to 13.6%. We had another good solid cash flow generation quarter. We got off to a good start in returning excess cash to shareholders and we expect to complete our $750 million by our buyback program over the next few months.", "We continue to make steady progress in our key strategic initiatives with focusing the portfolio and simplifying our manufacturing footprint, and of course, there is a lot of work yet to do there. And we did increase our outlook for EPS based on the strong Q1, and the current order rates we\u2019re seeing. So, all in all, pretty solid quarter.", "And with that, I will open up the line to questions. Operator, can you please open the line?", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "Certainly, it will be my pleasure. [Operator Instructions].", "And we do show a question from the line of Steven Fox with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "Hi, good morning. Couple of questions. First of all, can you talk about the growth in the wireless business, a little bit more on the handset side? Where are you? What kind of products are you having most success with and in what type of customers by region?", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Steve. Our wireless business really has\u2026 are you talking about the wireless business in our components segment?", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "Yes, I\u2019m sorry in the electronics components segment.", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. Sure. Well, I think as you know, historically, we\u2019ve not been a real big player in that segment and about three or four years ago put a big push on for obvious reasons, given the strength of that segment to become a significant player. And I think the team has done a real good job of steadily improving our position and broadening our connective product line and just really dedicating more engineering resources to the big customers. We can\u2019t get into customer-by-customer detail, but we\u2019re now in all the big customers. One of those big three, we\u2019re still not a major player, but we are in the door. But in the top five, we have a strong position. So, a lot of products are now ending up in mobile phones in every region of the world. And we really feel good about the progress.", "And I would say the most important key there again as we increased the engineering resources dedicated to that. It\u2019s a project-by-project basis and so far we\u2019ve been executing well.", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. And then, secondly, on the Undersea Telecom business. You mentioned that you built more backlog and more projects. Can you sort of help us out on what the implication for full year revenues are now for that business? And what it means for margins off of the margins you just put up?", "Terrence R. Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, Steve, it\u2019s Terence. When you look at the year, certainly, we had about $300 million revenue in the first quarter. We did have the big Trans-Pacific project that we will be wrapping up where we see\u2026 Undersea I think the best way to think about it is in the second quarter around $250 million of revenue. And right now, in the out years, probably about $150 million, out quarters $150 million per quarter in the out. So, that is adding to the increase to our topline growth, increase our topline growth on guidance. You did see\u2026 we did see operating income pickup in that segment this quarter. I think with these levels, I would still expect them to be in the low double digits for the year.", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thank you.", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thanks. And our next question then comes from the line of Will Stein of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "William Stein - Credit Suisse", "Thank you. I would just like to make sure I understand your comments with regard to the weak U.S. economy. It sounds like you have been seeing weakness in this region for some quarters. Not just in the current quarter. And I am wondering if you can comment as to how you expect the U.S. economy to factor in going forward. And how it is incorporating your current guidance?", "Terrence R. Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks Will. Yes, a couple of comments, first of all the weakness is really in the components business, the network business and our other infrastructure business is wireless are pretty robust right now or solid I should say in the U.S.", "In components, where we\u2019ve being seeing it for the last year is our U.S. automotive business. So, we\u2019ve been doing very well in Europe and Asia and that\u2019s where our strength is, and that\u2019s where about 80% of our business is. But U.S. automotive is actually for us being down in revenue, almost eight quarters I think straight now. So, it\u2019s been soft for a while. We don\u2019t expect that to improve in \u201808. We don\u2019t expect that to get significantly worse either. I mean it\u2019s been down quite a bit.", "And the other piece that\u2019s been down for about a year now is the appliance or the wasted space which is really directly correlated to the housing market. So, those are the two big markets that have overall kept us in the negative growth mode in the U.S. In industrial, we\u2019ve been\u2026. solid double digit, which is primarily U.S. and Europe. And in aerospace, which is primarily U.S., we\u2019ve been strong.", "William Stein - Credit Suisse", "So, it sounds like you\u2019re not contemplating erosion in areas outside of automotive or like this [ph] in your guidance, is that right? And I\u2019m--?", "Terrence R. Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I think that\u2019s fair to say, because when you look at the dynamics which we are driving. Wireless public safety, for example, strong, strong order in the\u2026 strong order book in the first quarter that\u2019s primarily U.S. business. So, we expect that to get a little stronger in the second half and then we continue to expect industry to hold up and aerospace and defense I mean, we\u2019re sold out to capacity.", "William Stein - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Great. Just one other. I am wondering if you can update us on capacity rationalization that happened in the quarter. I think you said earlier we\u2019re at 120 sites and maybe a quarter or two ago I thought we were at 130. Can you just bring me up to speed as to what\u2019s happened in the last quarter? And what the current plan is, when you currently expect the capacity rationalization to be essentially completed?", "Terrence R. Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Will, it\u2019s Terrence. I will take that. First off as we laid out, this is a long-term plan and we have it going out to 2010, what we communicated so, there is still, I think as Tom\u2019s comments said, still lot of work to be done. We do have as Tom mentioned 20 individual actions that are in progress currently. We ended last year, \u201907 with a 121 manufacturing sites. So, we did make some progress. We have touched already about 14 facilities that are either closed or are in the process of being closed from when we started the program and that\u2019s split pretty evenly between the US and Europe and Middle East and Africa. So, we're still early into it, I would say this quarter was really a continuation of what we started last quarter and the year before and in that regard, there was no new one action done in this quarter. We just said its continuation of what we have been working on.", "William Stein - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Thanks so much.", "Terrence R. Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you and we do have a question then from the line of Carter Shoop with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Carter Shoop - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Thanks guys and congratulations on a pretty good quarter there. One area that you guys have focused on in regards to gaining market share has been in the handset market and that is pretty evident this quarter and that end market that you talked about trying to reinvigorate has been consumer electronics market, not as much success there. Could we talk a little bit about what needs to be done to drive sales there and how important that is for Tyco Electronics in the components division?", "Terrence R. Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I would say consumer electronics is clearly an important focus area for us. I think if I had a rating in priority I would rate mobile phones a higher priority but doesn\u2019t mean that we are not paying as much attention to consumer electronics. I think as we discussed before I think within consumer electronics there is a mix of attractive products to go after and not so attractive. We have been selective. Where we have been successful is in gaming, is in big screen TVs, digital cameras. I would say our performance has been bumpy as those markets of ebbs and flows, we\u2019ve ebbed and flowed with them and as we are still relatively small so our revenue can move around quite a bit because of that. When I take a couple of year view of it and look over the past couple of years, we believe we are growing slightly ahead of market rates. So we are making progress and it is an important market for us.", "Carter Shoop - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Great. That\u2019s helpful. As a follow-up two questions on the cash flow. Could you provide us with the targeted range for free cash flow for fiscal year \u201908? And also could we talk about the longer term trend in cash taxes. I know you are looking for a 200 to 300 basis point reduction in the GAAP tax rate by 2010. Will not be decreasing at all for the cash tax rate?", "Terrence R. Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Carter, it\u2019s Terrence. I\u2019ll take that. First off, what we've said is over the long-term, I would except that our free cash flow will approximate net income. So, when you look at it over a very long-term cycle that past guidance where I think your hedge should look at. In regards to cash tax rate versus GAAP tax rate, I would not assume that the GAAP tax rate coming down will continue. You get the same on the cash tax rate due to us or NOL position that we are utilizing. So, where I think we will be is sub 20%. You saw a 17% in the first quarter, but we\u2019ll be in that for quite some time with our NOL position in the tax planning we are doing.", "Carter Shoop - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thanks. And we have a question then from the line of Matt Sheerin with Thomas Weisel. Please go ahead.", "Matthew Sheerin - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Yes. Thanks. Good morning. I'm hoping you to talk specifically about demand trends you\u2019re seeing in Europe besides from the automotive business. We\u2019re starting to hear from some of your distributors, which tend to focus on industrial markets that Europe is off to a little bit of a softer start in the March quarter which is normally up sequentially pretty strong. So, can you tell us what you are seeing there?", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. Europe\u2019s been strong for us for the past year and with another solid quarter in Q1 and particularly automotive was very strong in Europe. We expect that to slowdown a little bit over the balance of the year. I mean we don\u2019t expect it to falloff at the end of the year. But our outlook does have baked into it a little bit of slowdown in most of the markets there.", "Matthew Sheerin - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. And then with the buyback I know you have made some good progress there. If you were to complete that in the next few months given your plans for a free cash flow, would you expect to do an additional buyback?", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. We would.", "Matthew Sheerin - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Welcome.", "Operator", "Thanks. And our next question comes from the line of Yuri Krapivin with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.", "Yuri Krapivin - Lehman Brothers", "Hi. Good morning.", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning Yuri.", "Yuri Krapivin - Lehman Brothers", "Tom, so with all this being up 17% organically and 9% if you exclude the two volatile segments, you are guiding to organic sales growth of 5% to 7% all year. So, I think there is a little bit of a disconnect here. Are you guys are being conservative?", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, Yuri. I would think about it this way. Coming off a good quarter, good order growth, that\u2019s going to carry us through in the second quarter and we feel confident about that. And we do feel our outlook is balanced for the year. Admittedly, there just a lot less visibility, of course, for the last six months of the year compared to Q2. So, there are some signs out there for things to get softer, but it's not yet reflected in our order rate. So, if you were to peal back and look by our segments and kind of really that I think bad weather indicator of the economy for us is EC, we see growth slightly down in EC second half versus first half. So, we do see that coming off a bit and a part of that is because automotive has been really very strong in the first quarter, and we expect that to come down a little bit. So, that\u2019s our view. It's a pretty balanced outlook of the year, and we feel comfortable with it.", "John M. Roselli - Vice President, Investor Relations", "And Yuri, this is John. I would just add a little bit of the disconnect between the order rates in Q1 and the growth rate we're looking at in Q2 relates to some of the orders we took in, are for some of the out quarters in certain longer cycle markets like A&D, solar, oil and gas. Some of those markets we were getting orders that extend out as in the second half.", "Yuri Krapivin - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Great. And then we just back to your inventories. You mentioned that you feel good about the inventory for the balance of the year and that they were down on a year-over-year basis, but sequentially I think, your inventory position increased by about $250 million. So, could you please address this sequential increase in inventory?", "Terrence R. Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yuri, I think, you are a little bit high on your increase figure, sequentially. I think, it's a $100 million or so without FX, there is FX in there. When you look at it sequentially we always have a build in our first quarter and that build is just, we always get it down to fourth quarter at the end of the year and we do have a build going through the holiday season in quarter one. If you look at last year we had a much more significant build last year and it took us a long part of last year to burn that off. We did have an over build last year first quarter. I would not say we're in an overbuild situation. I feel very good about where we are for the rest of the year in inventories and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s pressure on the business to get it down. So, I do think it's in connection. My comment on year-on-year, if you look at nine days. The nine days overall being down in inventory is were we expect to be in longer term. Like I said we\u2019ll be in the mid 70s on average over time.", "Yuri Krapivin - Lehman Brothers", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thanks. And our next question then comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup", "Thank you and congratulations. Can you talk a little bit about what type of visibility you have? We all read the newspapers; we all see the news about, concerns about recessionary type things. What type of visibility do you have and maybe if you can give us the different segments. Is this a month\u2019s visibility, is it a quarter visibility and when things slow like in past cycles. How fast does it slow and have we seen any of your customers starting to kind of temper down some of their ordering?", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Jim. I would say\u2026 I\u2019ll answer your last question first. No. We have not seen any change in the order patterns. Particularly in what I call our industrial infrastructure businesses and that\u2026 if you look at that, that\u2019s about 40% of our business. Things like Wireless probably save the Undersea Telecom. Pretty long order cycle, you get the backlog for example we mentioned there\u2019s a big order bookings in Undersea and in Wireless in the first quarter. That\u2019s sort of can be for the full year\u2019s worth of activity in some cases even more in our Network Solutions business, because it's project oriented it tends to be longer term.", "Components generally is the shortest without question and I think, if you look over the past years, where there\u2019s been slowdowns it can come quicker in the Components businesses, for sure particularly in the consumer related businesses. So, we watch that very closely, but we really haven\u2019t seen any significant change in pattern. I mean U.S. automotive continues to be lousy for us and I think for a lot of people. The Appliance business the same way. Consumer Electronics businesses has slowed down a little bit.", "Mobile Phones continue to be really solid and we're actually\u2026 we have some capacity constraints, in fact there, which is not so great for our customers and we're working through it. But it's a better column to have so on balance we have not seen that in\u2026 I was with a bunch of customers last week and we were all asking each other the same question. Because you look at the newspapers and hear the news and you sort of feel one thing and then you look at the order book there as well and see something else. So, I\u2019ll tell you, we're all staying closely connected to make sure if there were a change there we pick it up quickly so we can adjust. But I haven\u2019t seen any push cancellations or anything like that.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup", "Okay. And just a little color as far as\u2026 if something like that were to happen, would it happen like within a couple of months time period, couple quarters, couple of weeks, how fast in the past cycles have you seen it.", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "It's usually about a quarter and really what's been going on I think a good example is U.S. Automotive when you see the increased amounts of plant closings or farewells and stuff like that and that repel effect for us is usually in the quarter range. Maybe a little bit less than a quarter there. In other areas we do have one indicator we have is about 15% of our business is redistribution and that\u2019s been slow in the U.S. that\u2019s where our biggest distribution business is, and we have a good idea within the channel and we certainly know our selling and sell-through. So, that\u2019s another indicator we look at. It is inventories would spike there, that would be the time for us to put on the brakes. We have actually have been expecting that to bounce back a little more than it has and it\u2019s still relatively flat for us. But we haven\u2019t seen any material increase in our inventory in the channel. So, all the different indicators we look at, we are not getting any feedback. But I would say, typically think about a month, I mean a quarter, sorry\u2026 about a quarter would be the lead time we would have.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup", "And then a quick clarification question. On Undersea Telecom that was $314 million revenues this quarter and if I heard correct, you are guiding to about or expecting about $250 million next quarter followed by $150 million thereafter. If that\u2019s correct, does that also include that $750 million new program booked, and when the new program like that gets booked, what type of lifeline or a lifeline longevity does that have?", "Terrence R. Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Jim, it\u2019s Terrence, couple of things. Yes, you are right on how you thought about the quarters particularly at the quarters. That $750 million is not one order, it is multiple orders. And from that viewpoint it will based upon demand capacity that we can actually install the system and some of those orders will actually be trickle into \u201909. So not all those orders were for this year, some of those orders go into next year.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup", "And maybe typical I think of a like a three to five quarter contracts.", "Terrence R. Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I think that depending upon our ability and capacity could be anywhere out four to six quarters depending upon\u2026", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "That typically is the average from the time we sign a contract to you workout the logistics and you actually finish the contract, of course, depending on the size of it. For example, that big Trans-Pacific Express contract is about an 18 monther. What is happening now is\u2026 an activity is\u2026 there\u2019s more activity than there was a year ago, so the lead time is pushing out a little bit because there is capacity limit in the industry.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup", "Great. Thank you and congratulations.", "Terrence R. Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks Jim.", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you", "Operator", "Thanks and our next question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. Just a detailed question on currency. Wondering if you have the EPS impact of currency in the quarter?", "Terrence R. Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Ajay, it\u2019s Terrence. On the\u2026 we did have as you saw on the topline that benefited us seven points above our organic growth and that was all currency, that was about\u2026 that was above our four points we expected and it did contribute to about $0.01 above our guidance. Overall, FX helped EPS by $0.03 year-over-year.", "Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs", "And what do you have built into your full year guidance.", "Terrence R. Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "In our guidance we have four points on the topline going through and that would fall through at our normal operating margin trend for the year.", "Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. So, maybe something like $0.12. I mean, is annualizing the first quarter a good way of thinking?", "Terrence R. Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It would be less than that due to the Euro got stronger towards the second half of the year, so it will be less than that number.", "Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Great. And assuming stable raw material prices. I was wondering if you have any specific number that you could share.", "Terrence R. Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "In org where we are right now, copper has been around 320. We have fixed most of the second quarter around the 320, 330 rate and a chunk of the third quarter at the same rate. So, copper for the year\u2026 year-on-year for the total year is pretty similar so that\u2019s not really a headwind year-on-year, certainly between the quarters. For example, in \u201907, copper went down to 270 in the second quarter and went up higher so second quarter there be a little bit of a compare issue there. The real factor, this year\u2019s gold, gold has gone from 650 per ounce up to almost 900 and that is a headwind in our\u2026 it is included in our guidance for the year, so gold right now is probably a headwind before consideration of price of about $10 million a quarter.", "Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs", "So, $10 million year-on-year\u2026", "Terrence R. Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. Per quarter.", "Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs", "Great. Shifting to Wireless, maybe if you could help us understand the progression of revenue, as you implement the New York State project. So, how should we think in terms of the ramp up by quarter later this year.", "Terrence R. Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "On the revenue on the state of New York it would depend upon the acceptance but that would primarily be in Q3 and Q4. It will depend on the timing when acceptance occurs so it will be later in the year in that regard, Ajay..", "Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thanks and our next question then comes from the line of Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Hi. A few quick questions. Just a follow-up on raw materials. On the other side of that equation what are you seeing in terms of ASPs and the electronics component business right now.", "Terrence R. Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "ASPs, price erosion is really running about where it was last year. Overall, average 2% to 3% range so not a big change. Having seen in that business for all of us in that business that we deal with different negotiations but generally having seen a significant change in erosion.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Okay. Second question is\u2026 getting back to the cash flow. How much stock have you repurchased so far in the quarter?", "Terrence R. Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "In Quarter One it was $259 million.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "And through I guess, January in Quarter 2?", "Terrence R. Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We would be up for about $400 million.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Okay. And then just do you have an updated full year CapEx number?", "Terrence R. Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We still believe CapEx will be in the long term range that we have given out before which is into the 4% to 5% sales range for the year.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Okay. And then one final question just on operating expenses. How should we expect in the tracks for the year pretty stable on the dollar basis or maybe declining the growth in kind of restructuring as the year moves along?", "Terrence R. Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I don\u2019t think that you should assume that it would decrease in dollars. I think what you saw in the first quarter; we got a little bit of benefit leverage from SG&A rate perspective due to the strong growth in Undersea. But from a dollar perspective, our actions that we set on the footprint really does not influence SG&A. So, I think from a dollar perspective, you would assume moderate growth in that, but you won\u2019t assume a decline.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thanks. And our next question comes then from the line of Brian White with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Brian White - Jefferies & Co", "Okay. Just looking at the automotive market within the Electronic Components business, U.S. is obviously slow and you said Europe is seeing some signs of slowing. Will growth decelerate in 2008 versus 2007 for the Auto-Electronic Components business?", "Terrence R. Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I compared it to Q1 and we were at 8% 9% in Q1 so, we would expect to run 5% to 6% for the year.", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "That compares to about 6% last year. So, not meaningfully different.", "Brian White - Jefferies & Co", "Okay.", "Terrence R. Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And that is production is expected to be down about 200 basis points year-on-year from about a 4.7 to about a 2.5 year-on-year, Brian.", "Brian White - Jefferies & Co", "Okay. And when we look at the March quarter, how should we think about the four different segments in terms of sequential growth? What markets\u2026 what segments will actually go up and what will go down?", "Terrence R. Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sequentially, if you look at it EC will grow and networks will decline. We typically get a little seasonality coming into the winter months in networks. Wireless will be up a little bit and Undersea Telecom will be down as I mentioned on their quarterly. So, I think when you look at the second quarter, when you take all that, second quarter P&L other than taxes should look fairly similar to Quarter 1.", "Brian White - Jefferies & Co", "Okay. And just a question for Terrence, the inventory number that was given out for the September quarter and the one given out today for the September quarter changed a little bit. I think that was one of the reasons for confusion on the sequential inventory dollar change. What is that attributed to?", "Terrence R. Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "There was a re-class made out of prepaid, up in the inventory there were some re-classifications we have done for consistency. Doesn\u2019t change the balance sheet at all, it\u2019s just the re-class between some lines.", "Brian White - Jefferies & Co", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thanks. And our next question then comes from the line of Aaron Husock with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Aaron Husock - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the restructure savings that you\u2019re seeing on the cost line, so far in the restructuring program. And when you expect that savings to kick in a little bit more meaningfully?", "Terrence R. Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "From the actions we took last year, there\u2019s a little bit of savings, but of course, we\u2019re going to ramp up our investments this year so when you net the investment against the savings, it\u2019s really a slight negative this year. We won\u2019t\u2026 we really won\u2019t start to see a net benefit of any magnitude until 2010 because we\u2019re going to spend in 130 to 150 for the next two or three years. And as we\u2019ve been saying all along the benefit of that is really backend loaded. With the net negative last year, it will be a smaller net negative this year. It will probably be a little bit of a wash overall between investment and savings in \u201909. And then we get the pickup in 2010.", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "And Aaron from what we started, everything that we started last year pretty much happened in the second half. So, really in Quarter 1 there was very minimal savings before the consideration of charges.", "Aaron Husock - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. As far\u2026 you are seeing that it will be a smaller negative in fiscal \u201908. Did that mean that the actual savings could be somewhere in that, say $100 million range or will it not be that high?", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "It will not be that high. Where we\u2019re going is last year we had about $100 million in charges. We\u2019ve got it to about $130 this year. So, when we\u2019re talking year-on-year comparing you got to take comparison not just the $130. So, no, we would not have $100 million of savings this year with what we kicked off last year. Remember we did say it was going to be about three year payback per project. So, on a $100 million, that would be about $30 million of savings when fully implemented.", "Aaron Husock - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thanks. And we do have a question then from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks. Just a question components margin, it looks like you were down 20 basis points sequentially in year-over-year despite having good organic trend. Could you just talk about why we aren\u2019t seeing incremental leverage in that part of the business?", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "I mean that was probably without question a one blemish on our results this quarter and that is very much absolutely related to our North American automotive business. Part of that is volume, but part of it is\u2026 as you know, we started to do a fairly significant restructuring near about nine months ago. It has taken us a little longer and we have not executed it as well as we typically have in that group in our North American auto business has done a great job over the last three years of keeping our margins attractive and the business that has declined. But we got a rough quarter in Q1. We should be through that by the end of Q2, but that caused our margin decline otherwise we would have been up in components. So, that was the one rough spot for us in the quarter.", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. So, I guess if I look at the business extra slow. In North America order driven restructuring issues, would it be fair to think you probably would have had 20% 25% incremental EBIT margins in that segment?", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "I would say 10 basis points to 20 basis points.", "Terrence R. Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I would have been 10 basis points to 20 basis points expanded versus what where we can\u2026", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "That\u2019s with 20 basis points down.", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "About a 20 basis points headwind on. And then just\u2026 I think you guys mentioned about three product line divestures, you guys said this quarter. Could you quantify the dollar impact of that?", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "When you look at it, it isn\u2019t the component segment but there are small product lines annualized revenue of that is about $20 million.", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "All right. And then I just kind of going back to one of the only questions is\u2026 potential for a downturn or what you are going to see. Doesn\u2019t look like you see any order book to show right now, but if you look at your bidding activity for new businesses is that part of a segment maybe slowing down, are you seeing less amount of bids that are going through the system over here and how that is working?", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "No. We are not seeing that yet. In some of our businesses, you are bidding, a year, two or three years out, take automotive for example. So, we are working on proposals for 2010/2011 and not as far as 2012. Even in something like mobile phone which the typical viewers say that\u2019s really a short cycle business and certainly orders can change short term depending on the fluctuation in end demand but the bidding we are doing is out a year or two. From the very beginning of trying to get a product designed into the architecture to when you end up shipping it, it\u2019s usually well over a year. So, we have not seen any material change in activity.", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "All right and just finally, can you talk about what debt to capital ratios are you guys comfortable with, comfortable with in terms of the bandwidth and I guess, I am just trying to get a sense of it? Can you sustain a $150 million buyback every six to nine months that we have done it this time around?", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "When you look at it, as I stated, right now with the size of our business and consideration of we do some shared liabilities, but we feel that the debt balance that we can hold is about $3.5 billion and withholding our liquidity position on around $500 million of cash. So, net debt around $3 billion with where we are now.", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Right, thanks a lot guys.", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Welcome. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thanks and your next question then comes from the line of Michael Allman [ph] with Neo Capital Partners. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you. Could you\u2026 you have indicated in the press release and on the call that you spent $259 million through repurchase stock in the quarter and yet on the cash flow statement the number that\u2019s given for repurchase of common shares is $232 million. Could you please explain the discrepancy?", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "The discrepancy would be, there were trades made towards the end of the quarter that did not settle until the following quarter. So actually cash went out was $232 million but we actually bought $259 million.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay.", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "That describes just the timing item that was settled into the quarter too.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And you made some comments about this new accounting standard. Do I understand properly that the $592 million of tax sharing income is going to remain non-cash forever?", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "The $500 million is two pieces of the tax sharing income of $572 million and also $20 million that relates to ongoing activity, so there\u2019s two pieces.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay.", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "And when you look at it, will it be non-cash forever, it will depend upon when all the shared liabilities related to our tax sharing agreement are done. The net, net at the end while definitely FIN 48 has created confusion when you look at it and it is a complex standard. When we separate it from Tyco we thought our total exposure net of the shared amounts are going to be about $600 million to $700 million, over time as we settle out our tax audits and issues. We still believe that that is the amount and the adoption of the standard doesn\u2019t change anything. So, while the ongoing run rate, my comments relate to the ongoing run rate, overall the tax exposure is related that we had when we separated, have not changed with FIN 48 to be in that next $600 million to $700 million that we stated before.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you and we have a question then from the line of Brian Jacobi with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Brian Jacobi - Goldman Sachs", "Yes. Good morning guys. Just a question on your capital structure, cash flow statement showing that you paid back some debt and on fiscal. I am curious what you repaid on, I am assuming you have repaid some of your rest of your bridge and maybe some on the revolver. If you could just tell me what the debt look like in end of the quarter?", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "At the end of the quarter, you are right. We still are operating on a small piece under the bridge. There is one piece of our capital structure that we still have to complete. We have about $500 million remaining under the bridge facility. So, that is still outstanding and the payment that we did make was under the bridge, if you look at our overall debt where we were around 3.2\u2026 $2.1 billion relates to the offerings we did in the fall. We had $500 million under the bridge and then we have CP for the remainder basically.", "Brian Jacobi - Goldman Sachs", "I mean, I thought you had 550 on the bridge last quarter. So, you didn\u2019t really pay much down where--?", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "We paid a little bit down on the bridge, rest would have been on the commercial paper, just depending between the bridge and the hammer.", "Brian Jacobi - Goldman Sachs", "In the fiscal year \u201908 or is that going to be more kind in \u201909, 2010 even.", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "In some targeted market, we are starting to build the pipeline for sure. If we could do a couple of targeted acquisitions and one in a couple of key areas this year, we would do it. It\u2019s really going to depend on\u2026 the properties rate fit for us and are they interested, but we are starting to rev that up.", "Brian Jacobi - Goldman Sachs", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our last question this morning comes from the line of Will Stein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "William Stein - Credit Suisse", "Thank you. Just a quick follow-up. The guidance for the full year, $245, to $255. Am I right in assuming that backs out the restructuring charges that you are going to incur in the year?", "Terrence R. Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "William Stein - Credit Suisse", "Okay. And then just one other quick one. The $102 payment for the Power Systems division, was that received in the December quarter or is that going to be received in March?", "Terrence R. Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That was received in this quarter. You can see it on the cash flow, Will.", "William Stein - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you and at this time we have no further questions in queue.", "John M. Roselli - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Okay. Great. Well, thank you for joining us.", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks all of you.", "John M. Roselli - Vice President, Investor Relations", "This morning and the IR team will be around for questions and we look forward to talking to you.", "Operator", "Great. And thank you very much.

Now, at this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a remainder this conference is being recorded. And I will now turn the meeting over to our host Mr. John Roselli, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "John Roselli - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thanks, Lauri. Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Tyco Electronics second quarter results for fiscal year 2008 and the press release issued earlier this morning. With me today is our Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch and Chief Financial Officer, Terrence Curtin.", "During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask you to look at today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary statements that we've included there. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning and we ask you to read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. The press release and all related tables can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at tycoelectronics.com. On our website, we have also included an 8-K filing containing the historical financials adjusted for the reclassification of our RF Components and Subsystems business from Wireless Systems segment into discontinued operations.", "Now, let me turn the call over to Tom for some opening comments and a review of our performance by end markets.", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, John and good morning to everyone. As this is our usual format, I will cover the key highlights for the quarter and then turn it over to Terrence who will walk you through the financial details and then I will wrap up with our outlook.", "Overall, we were very pleased with our performance in the quarter. Our top line growth of 14%, which was 7% organically reflects the diversity of our market mix and our balanced global presence and really a similar dynamics as we had in Q1. Our businesses that serve infrastructure and industrial markets, which represent about 40% of our sales and that includes undersea, wireless, networks and the industrial markets served by our Component segment grew 18% organically in the quarter. This more than offset the continued softness we are seeing in certain consumer markets in our Component segment, namely the U.S. portion of our automotive business, appliances, computers and consumer electronics. These markets were about flat in aggregate in the quarter.", "We are also pleased with our operating income performance in the quarter. Our 7% organic sales growth delivered an adjusted operating income increase of 17% over the prior year and our adjusted operating margin increased slightly to 14%. Our margins were up significantly in our Undersea and Wireless segments due to the volume growth we had in those businesses along with a more favorable sales mix in both businesses. Our sales mix was unfavorable in our Network Solutions segment as our most profitable market, our Telecom business, experienced a slight revenue decline.", "We had another very good cash flow quarter generating $349 million of free cash flow, a 47% increase over the prior year. We used this cash to repurchase over 10 million of our shares in the quarter. We also had another quarter of good progress to become a more focused company with the announcement that we were pursuing the divestiture of RF Components and Subsystems business formerly in the Wireless Systems segment.", "Now, I'm going to talk about our revenue performance in several key end markets by segment. Starting with our Electronic Component segment, our sales grew 9% in the quarter or 1% organically and as expected we had low organic growth in the quarter for some of the reasons I mentioned earlier and I will touch on now. Our sales for the automotive markets grew 12% overall and 2% organically. On an organic basis, we grew 3% in Europe where we generate more than half of our automotive sales. As we'd indicated on the last call, we had expected this business to decelerate after the very strong 9% growth we generated in Q1.", "In Asia, our sales grew 10% organically lead by very strong growth in China where we have a very nice position. In the U.S. our sales were down 17% in the quarter driven by significant production cuts by the U.S. manufacturers.", "Overall, our global order rates for this business remain solid and we expect organic sales growth to return to the mid single digit range in the third quarter.", "In the computer market our sales declined 6%, the decline was partially due to the continued exit of the low-margin product line especially in the desktop segment of the market. In addition, we are also being more selective with new projects in this area due to the commoditized nature of this market and this is consistent with the strategy we announced over a year ago.", "In our communications market, our sales grew 14% organically in the infrastructure portion of this market, which is about 60% of our revenue, sales grew 5% lead by growth in emerging market. This will offset declines in the U.S. and EMEA, a continuation of the weakness we've seen in those markets for the past couple of quarters.", "In the mobile phone market which is about 40% of our communications sales, revenue grew 43% in the interconnect products portion of this market as we continued to gain share in this very, very important market. We expect our sales to continue to be strong in this market for the remainder of the year.", "In industrial markets, we grew 26% and 16% on an organic basis, reflecting increased demand in the solar, oil and gas and industrial equipment segments of the market. Our sales to the aerospace and defense market grew 17% including currency or a 11% organically. We continued to build backlog in this market and expect continued solid sales growth for the balance of the year.", "In the appliance market, our sales declined 5% organically primarily due to the continued negative impact from the U.S. housing market. This is the continuation of the last several quarters and we do not expect this market to turn up for the balance of the year.", "Finally, in the consumer electronics market, our sales declined 20% in the quarter. We do not yet have a significant presence in this market and the platforms where we are strong had low volumes in the quarter.", "Let me now talk about our Network Solutions segment where sales grew 14% on a reported basis and 5% organically. Our Building Networks business was up 14% organically as we continued to see increased infrastructure spending, particularly in China and India where we have a leadership position.", "In the energy market, our sales grew 5% in the quarter. Growth was solid in EMEA and Asia and this was partially offset by decline in North America, again related to the housing slowdown.", "Finally, our sales for the communications service provider market were essentially flat with growth in North America offset by lower than expected sales levels in Europe. As we mentioned on the last call, we were expecting a seasonally slower quarter in this market but we were also more impacted by fiber... slowdown at fiber rollout by certain characters in Europe and this was a bit of a disappointing quarter for us in this market. We do expect, however, to see this bounce back... begin to bounce back in the third quarter.", "For the Network segment overall we grew our backlog in the quarter and we continue to expect organic sales growth in the 6% to 8% range for the year. We had another strong quarter in our Undersea Telecommunications business. Our sales grew 122% in the quarter. Activity continues to remain robust and we booked several large projects during the quarter resulting in a backlog that remains over $1 billion. We'll begin work on these projects in the second half resulting in higher sales levels that we had been expecting.", "Finally, in our Wireless Systems segment, which now consists of only our public safety business, our sales grew 24% organically, primarily reflecting higher radio sales related to re-banding efforts for the major customer. We expect Q3 to be another good quarter for this segment.", "With respect to the State of New York Wireless project, we concluded our testing on the first region with very good results and we've now turned over testing to the State. Once their testing is complete we will begin to recognize revenue on the project and we expect this will occur in the fourth quarter.", "Now let me turn it over to Terrence who will take you through the financials in more detail.", "Terrence Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Since Tom did go through the revenue trends, I'll go through the P&L then cash flow and a few other items. Our operating income in the quarter was $501 million on a GAAP basis, which included a $36 million gain from the sale of real estate in our Electronic Components segment, $26 million of restructuring costs and $23 million charge related to our portion of Tyco International Security Litigation settlement with the State of New Jersey. Our GAAP operating margin was 13.7%.", "On an adjusted basis, our operating income was $514 million, an increase of 17% over the prior-year. The increase in operating income was driven by sales growth, improved productivity and pricing as well as the favorable impact of currency effects. These positive effects were partially offset by higher commodity costs. Our adjusted operating margin was 14%, an increase of 20 basis points over the prior year lead by Undersea and Wireless.", "Turning to segment performance, in our Electronic Components segments, the adjusted operating income increased 8% year-over-year on organic sales growth of 1% and the adjusted operating margin declined slightly to 14.4%. Improvements in productivity and pricing essentially offset the margin impact of relatively flat volume and higher commodity costs. Overall, we were pleased with our margin performance in the quarter in light of these headwinds.", "Going into Q3, certainly raw material headwinds will persist and this is reflected in our guidance.", "The adjusted operating margin in the Network Solutions Segment, we had a decline of 140 basis points to 12% in the quarter. This was primarily due to the mix of sales between end markets including a decline of almost 20% in the communication service provider market in Europe in our sales. That decline negatively impacted our productivity in our operations in this segment.", "We do expect our margins for the segment to improve to 13% to 14% range in the third quarter. In our other two segments, Undersea Telecommunications and Wireless Systems, both had a very nice year-over-year margin improvement. Both segments benefited from strong sales increases and a favorable sales mix. In the Undersea segment, the favorable project mix drove our margin higher sequentially, despite the lower revenue.", "In Wireless, which now excludes the RF Components and Subassembly business, we expect double-digit margins for the rest of this year. As we talked to you about before, these are both project-oriented businesses, so there will be sales and margin variation depending upon the projects and force and the related timing of our execution on the projects.", "Now to non-operating matters, on interest expense, it was $40 million in the quarter. This was down slightly versus last year reflecting lower net debt levels.", "In taxes, our income tax expense for the $171 million in the quarter resulting in a GAAP effective tax rate of 36%. On an adjusted income basis, our effective tax rate was 32.6% compared to our guidance of 36% to 37% and this added approximately $0.03 to our EPS related to guidance. The lower tax rate reflects the patchable effect of an improvement in our full-year tax rate based upon some of the planning that we've completed. We now expect our tax rate to be approximately 36% for the next two quarters.", "On cash taxes, cash taxes paid in the quarter were $118 million and our cash tax rate on adjusted income was 24%. This was slightly up year-over-year this reflects a $0.09 improvement in our operations, $0.02 from a lower share count, and also a $0.02 benefit from currency effects. These positive effects were offset partially by $0.06 headwind from a higher tax rate.", "Turning to cash flow, our statement of cash flow was affected by the final transfer of the Tyco International class action settlement that drove off our balance sheet. While we funded our shares of the settlement last year, it is treated as a cash outflow in our operating cash flow with a corresponding inflow in our investing cash flow. It has no impact whatsoever on our overall financial position or capital structure. When you adjust for this item, our cash from continuing operations was $479 million, an increase of 32% over the prior-year quarter. Also as Tom mentioned, the free cash flow was $349 million, an increase of 47% primarily reflecting operating income levels increases as well as some advance payments from customers in our project businesses.", "Looking at our working capital, our receivables and payables were 69 days and 54 days respectively. Our inventory levels increased modestly to 86 days as we built inventory for the expected sequential sales increase in quarter three. On a year-on-year comparison, we are up slightly. Most of that is driven by investment in the State of New York, which is reflected in our inventory balance on our balance sheet.", "Now, a few other items I want to highlight. During the quarter, we repurchased 10.3 million shares and where that leaves us at the end of the quarter, we had approximately 650 million remaining on the current authorization. And also as we mentioned in the press release, we're now reporting the results of our RF Components and Subsystems businesses as a discontinued operation. The results of this business were included in our previous guidance for the quarter and the full year. In the second quarter, the business generated $114 million of revenue and $4 million of operating income, which was about $0.005 per share after tax. For the full year, we had expected this business to contribute approximately $0.04 per share.", "With that let me turn it back over to Tom.", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Terrence. I'll cover our outlook now for the third quarter and the balance of the year. As you saw in our press release, we are raising our full-year outlook for adjusted EPS to a range of $2.60 to $2.66 per share, which is an increase of 21% to 24% over last year. This compares to our previous guidance of $2.45 per share to $2.55 per share. Our estimate of restructuring costs remains at approximately $130 million or 17% per share for the full year. We expect full-year sales growth of approximately 14% to 16% and we continue to expect full-year organic sales growth in the range of 7% to 9%. And just as a reminder, our guidance does not take into account any additional divestiture activity and it does assume that raw material prices and foreign exchange rates hold at the current levels.", "The increase in the guidance is based on our order rates, which remain solid especially in the businesses serving the global infrastructure, industrial and automotive markets. And as a result, our second half backlog is firmed up. This is more than offsetting continued softness in most of our consumer related markets. Again, a continuation of the trend we've seen for the last several quarters. We also continue to get a net benefit from the strength of foreign currencies.", "For the third quarter, we expect sales growth of 15% to 17% over prior-year sales of $3.3 billion with organic growth of 7% to 9% and double-digit operating income growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.66 to $0.68, an increase of 35% to 39%. The year-over-year comparison does benefit from a lower tax rate and higher other income compared with the prior-year quarter. These items favorably impact the comparison by $0.07 per share. Restructuring costs are expected to be in the range of $0.03 per share in the third quarter and including these costs. EPS from continuing operations are expected to be $0.63 to $0.65 per share.", "Now, just let me recap our call for today before we go into Q&A. The diversity of our business in global presence is paying off with organic growth of 7%, adjusted operating income of 17% and adjusted earnings per share of 12%. Operating margins are up slightly year-over-year to 14% and we continued to track to our long-term goal of 15%. And as you recall, a year ago, our margin including businesses that we've since divested or announced we're going to divest was about 12.7%. So, we're making good, steady progress in this area.", "Our strong cash flow generation was used to repurchase over 10 million shares. We made another significant step forward in focusing our business with the planned divestiture of the Wireless Component and Subsystems business. And all four segments in the company now have double-digit operating margin. And if you add in the Power business and the product lines we've exited in, primarily in computer but also some in a few other market segments, we've divested or announced the divestiture of about $1.2 billion of low-margin in non-strategic revenue today.", "And finally, we are increasing our EPS outlook to a 21% to 24% growth over the prior year, again based on strong Q2 earnings and backlog increases in all of our segments along with some FX lift.", "So with that, we feel pretty good about the quarter, we are making progress on our longer-term objectives and now we'll open it up for questions.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Matt Sheerin with Thomas Weisel Partners. Please go ahead.", "Matthew Sheerin - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Thank you and good morning. Just a question on the margins going forward, it looks like you definitely had some favorable product mix within both components and your other divisions that helped boost the gross margin. So, going forward, given the mix in the June quarter, are you expecting that to be sustainable or will that be down a bit?", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Hello Matt. Yes, we do expect the margin to run in the 14% range plus or minus 20 basis points depending on mix, commodity pricing, currency but we feel like we've got the business up to that 14% range and we should stay in there for the next couple of quarters.", "Matthew Sheerin - Thomas Weisel Partners", "And if you breakdown gross margin versus SG&A, is it similar to last quarter? It looks like SG&A was up a good bit in the March quarter. So, was that partly currency related or some extra expenses from your other divisions?", "Terrence Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Matt, it's Terrence, let me get the SG&A. SG&A is always going to bounce around a little bit. It was a little bit higher this quarter. You will see year-to-date it's right on 12%. I think that is the right long-term rate to think about. There is a lot's of moving parts in there bases up on where sales are, but I think you will always see our SG&A right around 12% and then Tom's point will be around 14% new line and that basically moves up to the gross margin.", "Matthew Sheerin - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. And then my follow-up also regarding margins and pricing, you talked about materials still being a bit of a headwind that you are offsetting that obviously through cost-cutting and other things, but going forward, have you looked at selective price increases particularly on your Components side? Have you talked to customers about that yet?", "Terrence Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We're always doing that that Matt and as you know in the Components business, most pricing is really on a project-by-project basis, but I think we've made pretty good progress in the last year or so in how we go to... how we implement pricing, our overall pricing controls and our price erosion is down from where it has been. So yes, we are constantly working the pricing angle and, I think, making steady progress.", "Matthew Sheerin - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. Thank you.", "Terrence Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "And our next question from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks. Good morning, guys.", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Terrence Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, Amit.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "I guess you... I heard the comments on the Components margins and how it went down about 20 basis points sequentially at least... year-over-year, I'm sorry. But if I look at it sequentially, they were up actually about 50 basis points on relatively flat sales. Could you just talk about puts and takes, I know you had a better mix, but how about 50 basis points from the restructuring benefit that we may be seeing over here?", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "One of the big things there, as you recall, we had been struggling in our North America automotive business where sales have been down and remained down there. But as we went through some restructuring there, we did have some issues. That began to stabilize and improve in Q2 so that definitely helped the margin, a little bit favorable mix, pricing a little bit better. So those are the three main things that account for the improvement.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "All right. And then just on the Undersea Telco business, I know you guys said you expect better sales in the back half than you initially expected, but I think it was around $150 million run rate. It's really every time I pick the newspaper, you guys seem to be winning a new order in that segment. Could you just maybe quantify what you expect in the back half and also what sort of margins could this business run at?", "Terrence Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Amit, it's Terrence, I will take that. When you look at Undersea, I think, Tom mentioned that, we were... we book new projects like you mentioned at the backlog at the end of quarter one was $1 billion and we've maintained that at end of March. So you're right that the $150 million that we talk about per quarter in Q3 and Q4, I would recommend you keep it more around $250 million in Q3 and more like a $225 million in Q4. On your margin question, the second quarter was almost 15%. That was a very high margin benefited by favorable mix. I would expect you should have more of a 13% to 14% operating margin mindset around that business than where we had it in Q2. So that will be a little bit of a headwind as we go through the rest of the year.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "All right. And just my final question, and hop off after that. On the Industrial segment, it seems really good organic trends over there. I'm not sure if you break it up this way, but if you do, it would be helpful. How much of that business is, sort of late cycle end-market driven, be it energy, oil and natural gas or power versus with the only cycle segments?", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Well, our industrial has got a significant mix to it. So, there is a piece of oil and gas per sure. Alternative energy has been very high, alternative lighting, which is still a small business but it's very, very high growth. And then as factories move to Ethernet-based communications and controls that piece. So, there is a number of there and also buried within our industrial is our medical business, which is experiencing nice growth, very brood based.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "But, doesn't sound like there is a lot of residential or light commercial kind of exposure in there?", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "No.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "All right.", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "The piece of residential is flat to down.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Fair enough. Thanks a lot and congratulations on the quarter.", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup", "Great. Thanks very much. Can you talk a little bit about, I think you had mentioned Wireless expect double digits going forward. When you talk about double digits, are you talking 12% to 16% type thing or as we start to see more of the equipment and the product rollout that the Wireless starts to really increase there?", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "I think right now, Jim, similar to Undersea, Wireless is going to have some flows based up on how projects are moving. I would right now put it in the low double digits at where we are from a scale. It is a small business. As it grows I think you could see that move up. For my comments really for the rest of the year expected in the low double digits.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup", "And then on the Undersea, very nice improvement there, but you mentioned that the backlog has remained stable and in essence you have one more business added into the bucket there. I guess it would be fair to say that that Undersea Telecom business should see potentially even margin enhancement beyond the 15%. Is that fair? Are we talking approaching 18% to 20% or I just want to keep expectation realistic there?", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, Jim, as I mentioned to Amit, the 15% we saw really was a factor of some product mix that we had in the quarter between contracts. I still think, and how we think about it, it is still 13% to 14% at these business levels.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup", "Okay. And as a quick follow up. There has been some talks about some fiber optic push outs or delays in Europe or something. Can you talk or give us a little bit of light on that?", "Terrence Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. That was the primary reason for our second quarter Telecom portion of our Networks business being under the performance we expected. That business for the last year, I would say, has been pretty lumpy. The underlying characteristics were still very attractive and all of the telecoms we are dealing with over there have pretty robust fiber plans because of competitive requirements. But the rate of deployment tends to be [inaudible]. Nobody stops but sometimes it accelerates and it slows down as they refine each of their on strategy. So mid to long term, we really like our position there and that it can't be a little bit lumpy like it was this quarter for us in the short term.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup", "Are these just temporary push outs or these are like cancellations or do they come back in?", "Terrence Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We're not seeing cancellations. It's more temporary.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup", "Okay, great. And if my math is right, my last point of clarification here, are you about halfway through of your divestiture plan and seems like it's progressing, in my mind, may be a little bit faster that what you thought for about a three-year run rate?", "Terrence Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "With the announcement of the most recent one, that would put us about two-third and the two big important ones were Power and RF business. So we focus on those big ones and additionally, as I mentioned, have been exiting some product lines. So, we are two-thirds of 70% there and I'd say we are slightly ahead of plan, Jim.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup", "Thank you and congratulations.", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Terrence Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Jim.", "Operator", "We go next to the line of Steven Fox with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "Hi, good morning. First question on the Auto business, you've talked about some of the puts and takes and you also talked about reaccelerating of year-over-year growth, but can you talk sequentially how much seasonality factors into that for the June quarter and where it is at and also how the comparisons look versus a year ago?", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "I think from Q2 to Q3 sequentially versus year-over-year, Steve, it's not so much a seasonality. We had... business was really strong in Q1, particularly at the end of Q1. We expected a little bit of slowdown in Q2 and now our orders have been solid through Q2 and we expect that to go back to the 5% to 6% range in Q3 and for the year, we expect that to run in that range. So, very, very strong growth in China, in particular. Feel like we're gaining share and we're strong in the Japan market and with the new products we've launched in last year, we're growing faster than the market there. We are strong in Korea although that market has been a little slow. You know the U.S. story. And Europe has been pretty solid and we continue to... we think Europe will be a little slower in the second half for automotive than the first half but still going to be solid and third quarter will be better than second quarter.", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "Great. And then just to make sure I'm clear, so, the catch up you did in the Carolinas, I guess, last quarter you said you were a little bit behind than where you're planned to be. So, is the restructuring all done in the Carolinas for those three plants having been consolidated?", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "It's largely done. We're still not running at the productivity level that we would expect to. Now part of that is because the market is down so much. But part of it is because we're just not where we should be but we are doing a little bit better than we did in first quarter, which was better than we did in the fourth quarter of last year. So we're making progress.", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "And then, last question on restructuring. So, can you give us an update on plans for Europe? Is there anything that we should be focusing on for second half of the calendar year in terms of accomplishments over there?", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "No, we can't, as you know, we can't get specific because of the requirements of all these things but if you... we're still estimating that we are going to spend about $130 million for the year. We spend roughly $50 million in the first half of the year and the fourth quarter will be more significant than the third quarter.", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "I guess, what I was getting at Tom is there any... in your full-year guidance, now does that have some improvements in Europe from restructuring?", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Not significant.", "Steven Fox - Merrill Lynch", "All right. Thank you.", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "You are welcome. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to the line of Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Hi, good morning. Looking at the Undersea Telecom business, I guess, if you can provide some additional visibility into potential order trends beyond the $1 billion backlog. Is this the peak we're looking at right now and maybe what are you seeing into the back half of '09 and what should margins look like at that point in time?", "Terrence Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Shawn, it's Terrence. When you look at the back half of '08, I said the $250 million and $225 million. Certainly order and activity remains robust. We're benefiting this year from the China project called TPE. So this year, when you take where we've been plus the next two quarters, we would be in excess of about $1 million of revenue this year. I would say that that is... it does benefit from that China project. We still see good order activity but right now, I don't think we would expect it to be $1 billion of revenue next year. That's what we see right now.", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Just a couple of points to add to that China. I think, clearly if you go back where we expected this business six months ago is stronger than we thought. Really, three or four drivers there, redundancy for systems particularly in Asia, which really didn't have redundancy and if you recall there was an earthquake a couple of years ago of the Taiwan that had some damage, just more bandwidth in Asia because of Internet usage. And business that's always been kind of on again, off again in Africa, in the Middle East, particularly Africa, a couple of systems have started to happen, they've got funding, they've made deposit. So there is clearly more activity. It's hard to gauge visibility beyond '09 right now and that's one of the things we're working hard at a couple of these projects definitely kind of popped up unexpectedly. The good news is we are pretty well positioned with our combination of our technology and our shift infrastructure but I would say, it's pretty hard. We don't expect '09 to be as good as '08. We do expect it to be solid and beyond there it's hard to gain visibility right now.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "If revenues were declined to may be $175 million run rate in the business, what should we expect operating margins to look like?", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Low to mid double digits, so probably more like a 12 to 13 verses where it is today. Since we have scaled the business after the Telecom bubble where this type of business activity, I would tend to think, will be in that 12 to 13 range if you're at your $700 million number annually that you quote.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Okay. SO not much degradation?", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "No.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Follow-up question, just on the share repurchase activity, maybe I missed this, but what are you expecting to do during the third quarter, do you expect to finish the plan by the end of the year and what's the likelihood of saying another share-repurchase authorization of a similar size once this is completed?", "Terrence Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "As we've said, Shawn, we're going to exercise share repurchases at excess capital and that's what we have been doing. So how we exercise the plan really will be a function of our cash generation and whether we have another strategic use for the cash. So we have been exercising under the program as we had very strong cash flow when we came out of last year with excess capital. Where we are now, it's really how we generate cash and how cash comes in will be how fast we look at the program, where something else come from.", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "And this is obviously a program we review on a regular basis with our Board as we did. In the last Board meeting, they approved the $0.5 billion increase, so I think we need to get through Q3 and see how things are shaping up and see what other options we have and we will go from there which is pretty much the way we've been approaching it.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "I guess that poses a follow-up in terms of acquisition activity. With the divestitures winding down, where are you at right now in building up maybe the potential pipeline for acquisitions?", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "We are beginning to build up a pipeline. Our priorities still are number one tighten up the operational performance of the company and while we're pleased with the progress we made over the last year, I don't think, you'd find anybody in our company who believes we're anywhere near hitting on all cylinders there. So that's still number one priority and in conjunction with that, continue to make sure, we focus the business and are really driving the products and businesses that make sense for us. So we have put more attention towards building a pipeline in selected industries with selected products. But I don't think you'd expect to see anything from us in the near term, next quarter or so.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Okay, Thank you.", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of William Stein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "William Stein - Credit Suisse", "Great. Thanks. You spoke a little bit about capacity restructuring in the Carolinas and addressed the question in Europe. Can you remind us where we are in that process overall, what the plan was as of the spin and where we are today in terms of number of facilities?", "Terrence Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. Thanks Will. About a year ago, we estimated that based on everything we wanted to do at the time, we saw this being in the range of $500 billion builds to do this restructuring with about a three-year payback. The plan really kicked in the fourth quarter of last year when we did $40 million to $50 million. So we are about $100 million to $120 million in it pretty much about where we have expected, there has been in that period of time about 21 since we have announced. Some are large, some are small, some are medium and then as I mentioned earlier this would be an ongoing thing for the next couple years. So, still a fair amount of work to do for sure.", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "The one thing I would add to that, when we announce an action it does take for a sizable action about a year to execute on. So there will be some delay in savings from execution announcement and getting through. So that is one thing that I want to make sure you understand", "William Stein - Credit Suisse", "21 actions but not 21 plant closures, in other words.", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Correct. And those could be migrations of product lines where the facility would still be in place.", "William Stein - Credit Suisse", "Okay, great. Next, I am wondering if you can remind us of the distribution strategy in Components. I think there has been an adjustment there during last quarter. Any comments you can make on plans for distribution there?", "Terrence Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure, about 15% of our total business goes through distribution and that is really in our Components in our Networks business. Yes, we did... we went through an assessment of our effectiveness in the channel for about three months with our various business leaders and then recently we have announced a new position in company of Vice President of Global Distribution who reports into, [inaudible], the new Vice President of Marketing and our goal there is to become more effective through the channel. I would say, we do a decent job. We have a long history there. We are well represented, but there are clearly opportunities to put it into the operational execution category for us to do better through that channel and through our each channels. So that's what we recently announced to our distribution channel partners.", "Matthew Sheerin - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Appreciate it. One more quick follow-up, if I can, can you remind us of how raw materials might be impacting the Network Solutions business? I think there is a lot of copper that flows through there, correct me if I am wrong, but I'd like to know what the margin impact might have been in the quarter and how you think about that, how you manage it?", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Our Network Solutions, well, we serve three markets, as you are aware, communication service provider, the energy and power utility as well as building networks. Really where metals impact the markets the most is really in our building networks, where we actually sell cabling. I mean that... in that market we actually have the ability to pass on copper prices. So, while it does impact us, we are able to pass that through. So it really doesn't have any impact on overall operating income.", "Matthew Sheerin - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Great, thanks very much.", "Operator", "We will go next to the line of Ajay Kejriwal with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs", "Good morning, gentlemen.", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Ajay.", "Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs", "Maybe just a quick follow-up on the automotive business in North America, 17% decline in revenues. Wondering if you could pass out [ph] what was volume versus pricing and also may be a... if you could relate that to the underlying production cuts that you're seeing in North America. To me it looked like a little more than production cuts. So, wondering if there was any inventory draw down or any issues with the restructuring or consolidation that you have mentioned.", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Thanks, Ajay. The vast majority of our issue is volume, although I will say that is the market where we are being more selective outside of the Connective productive line. We love the Connective product line and we would be more selective outside of that. So, we did decline with the North America suppliers a little more than they had production, which I believe is in the 11% to 12% range.", "Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs", "So, the decline more than the production cuts was because of non-core product lines, is that a right way to think about it?", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "That's the right way to think about it.", "Terrence Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And just to add to what Tom said, the other thing there is the mix of customers. The big three production was down more than overall production in North America. That number was more like minus 15. The most of our business in the U.S. is related to the big three and our mix of business within the big three also had some impact on that decline as well.", "Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs", "Got it. So, in terms of your expectations for the second half, I know, you mentioned overall for the business you expect mid-single digit but if you could help us with what are your expectations for North America auto?", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "I would say running similar to the rate we're at. We are not... we're certainly not baking in or expecting any recovery in the second half.", "Terrence Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Ajay, if you look at production for the year is going to be down including all manufacturers, not just big three, it is going to be down 5% for the year in the latest JD Power and that's our expectation based upon where our businesses with that production.", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "And I think the comps get easier as you get further into the year.", "Terrence Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Right.", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "So, without things improving the percentage decline may not be quite as large.", "Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs", "Got it. Maybe, just a question on the guidance, and if you could help me with the numbers here, $0.13 increase midpoint versus what you were previously. So, how much of that is from a lower tax rate now? You said, you're looking at 36% in the second half, first half was obviously much lower, so if I do my math correctly, the lower tax rate is about $0.08. Is that about correct or it there a different number?", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "That 's a little heavy. Let me give you a little bit of a walk here and then Terrence can talk about taxes. So about 6% of the improvement is what we did in Q2. Then you have to back out the business that we discontinued which had $0.04 in our full-year and then we picked up about a little bit of improvement across the other business of about $0.05, $0.02 to $0.03 for Undersea Telecom, $0.03 to $0.04 for foreign exchange. That'll give you rough idea. We did get benefit in Q2 for tax. Now let Terrence talk to that.", "Terrence Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Ajay, the tax benefit we have for the year really relates to what we saw in quarter two as we were guiding to a 36% to 37% for the year at the low end. But that was really $0.03 here in the quarter, may be in your $0.08 you're not including the other income impact as that is also coming down which when I talk tax includes also the other income reduction that we are seeing as well which will be a negative.", "Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, so that net effect of tax and other income is the $0.03 to $0.04?", "Terrence Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "$0.03, yes.", "Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs", "For the full year?", "Terrence Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Ajay Kejriwal - Goldman Sachs", "Great. Thank you.", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "And we go next to the line of Carter Shoop with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Carter Shoop - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Good morning, guys.", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Carter Shoop - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Wanted to first clarify something on the computing division within Components where we're continuing to walk away from businesses there or that comment more regarded on the year-over-year impact?", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "That's primarily year-over-year. I think we're... I don't see any more significant tuning there. I mean, we kind of think of our computing businesses tree in big block, laptop, desktop and server storage. We like the server storage space, we like the most of the laptop space, the desktop has really become a commodity and we've been retrenching from there and our share is down significantly in that space.", "Carter Shoop - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Moving over to the handset markets, can you discuss where you're gaining share, not necessarily by customer or by region but rather buy product, type of connector, just to clarify?", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I'd just say the share gains mostly in the connector space and we've introduced some new products around battery connectors, which have been pretty successful. So that has helped us. And we've grown our customer base for a long time. We are kind of re-energized in that business with Japanese handset makers, the we move to the Korean handset makers, and then we move to the European handset makers, though there is opportunity for us there to grow and we're pretty bullish about our prospects to continue our momentum in this category.", "Carter Shoop - Deutsche Bank Securities", "When I think about the handset market I think of it becoming increasingly commoditized like the computing market and I know there is a lot of different connectors that go into handset and some of the antennas and hence connectors are a little bit less commoditized than others, but what is your view longer term for that market and in regards to growth and why is it so important for you guys to be a larger player in this market?", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it's 1.1 billion units a year. So it's a very big market, I'd say that it is very different from the computer market and I expect it to largely stay that way because increasingly the way the handset makers compete is through design. And design means differences in the way the phones look. Of course the other thing that's helpful is as you jam more features in into the footprint of a particular handset design, you need the connectors to be able to work within that footprint. So there still is an awful lot of customization, in fact I think it's much as there has ever been, if not more customization in those markets. And as you start pumping through higher data rates you need more sophisticated antennas. You'll probably see an evolution to fiber optic connectivity in there with higher data rates. So there is a lot of innovation obviously by our customers and that means we need to stay with this. So that's why we are bullish.", "Carter Shoop - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Moving up a little bit, can you discuss your longer-term outlook for organic growth within the Components division, maybe over the next kind of three to five years, how do you think about that?", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "I still think it's in the 5% to 7%, 6% to 8% range as we laid out our three-year goals last year. We talked about 5% to 7% growth range and that deals make a balanced rate of growth given our size in the market and given the market's historical growth rates and given where we see, increase in electronic and certain categories. For example, as you put hybrid systems in the cars, you have a significant increase in connectors at the same time we've been backing off on the commodity side. So I think 5% to 7% feels like the rate... growth rate for our business and I think there is, as we continue to improve operationally, there is a good deal of operating leverage that will come with that.", "Carter Shoop - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Great. Two more quick questions, if I may, in regards to the State of New York contract and the testing at the State level, can you help us better understand if there is any risk associated with that testing or if it's more a matter of [inaudible]?", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I'd say with any big system, there is always risk and until you get that final sign off you don't have it. Having said that, I have been really pleased with our test results, the test results we get on call quality, which is really, really important of course in that industry have been the best we've ever seen and the State was very, very demanding and was really setting a new standard, not only for interoperability and for the ability for calls to be maintained when a fireman or a policeman is going five storeys down in a building which historically has been a problem in that industry.", "A bar was being raised and the coverage rates was being raised and we just completed three or four months of very, very expensive testing in the first two regions and did very well. The second phase of that as we turn it over to the customer and they go through two phases of testing and right now that testing is showing consistent results with our testing. So we feel good. First we've been working on the system for a couple of years. So we are anxious to get the first one up and running. The customers we deal with, I think, are really getting excited about bringing the first region on, but there is still timing risk, although I think it's slow right now. I really do, I think with everything we've progressed through in the last three to four months, our risk is down, but until we get that final sign off and turn it on and send the bill and get paid, we will still be a little bit anxious.", "Carter Shoop - Deutsche Bank Securities", "That's helpful. In regards to the wireless division and being able to sell that to other states, are we getting to the point now where you can use this as a selling or marketing point to other jurisdictions or do we need to wait until the system is up and going before we can really leverage the work that you guys have done here in the State of New York?", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Two things. Yes, we have been definitely using it and in the sense that one it's marked [ph] key customer and we bring people and to see that as well as by the way the State of Pennsylvania, which we completed over the last couple of years. And other thing is the system itself, which is pretty robust and has... it really has the state-of-the-art features for the early responders. It is being pretty well received out there. There are, in the last couple of quarters the orders in this business have been two of the best we've had ever. And I think we are on the verge of taking the business to another level because of New York, but also that's going to benefit us in other areas. We have to obviously deliver that into results. But I feel the best about this business for sure the two years I've been here.", "Carter Shoop - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Great. Thanks a lot and congratulations on a good quarter.", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Terrence Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Carter.", "Operator", "And we will go next to the line of Yuri Krapivin with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.", "Yuri Krapivin - Lehman Brothers", "Good morning.", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Yuri.", "Yuri Krapivin - Lehman Brothers", "I wanted to ask you another question about your raw material exposure, so I believe you effectively hedged your corporate exposure probably at around 350 per pound through the end of June via some of the contracts with your suppliers. Obviously currently the copper is about 350. So what are your plans in that regard? Are you planning to rollover those contracts through the end of the calendar '08?", "Terrence Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yuri, it's Terrence. We have been actively fixing with our suppliers and we, at this point, have in excess of 50% our requirements fixed through the end of our fiscal year right now. We will continue to evaluate what copper is when we look at going into next year, but our guidance includes the copper rate where it is at right now, 390 plus what we expect.", "John Roselli - Vice President, Investor Relations", "And just to add what Terrence said, Yuri, it's John. Gold is not an area where we are doing any hedging. So we're up year-over-year significantly on the pricing of gold and that is something that's been absorbed in our numbers. So when we talk about headwind it's really more of a gold discussion now than it is copper.", "Yuri Krapivin - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, well that side are you planning to hedge gold?", "John Roselli - Vice President, Investor Relations", "We have not yet, we will continue to evaluate that, Yuri.", "Yuri Krapivin - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. And then my other question has to do with this other category within your Electronic Components segment. So the other piece, I think, comprises about 25% of the total segment and the growth rate there has been fairly lackluster for the rest... for the last several quarters and it looks like that other categories sort of consistently and it deforms the overall segment growth rate. So could you comment please on what do you have in that other category and what's happening there?", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, that's primarily our sales through distribution, Yuri. And that business has been relatively flat overall for the last year, I think largely reflecting market conditions and inventory in the channel. But I mean clearly we see there as an opportunity as I mentioned earlier for us to improve. That's what primarily in that 25% number.", "Yuri Krapivin - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, thank you. And finally, you took a charge in the quarter for the litigation segment with the State of New Jersey, any other potential settlements that you see on the horizon that could trigger charges?", "A - Terrence Curtin>: Hi, Yuri, it's Terrence. When you look at the charge in the quarter, as you are aware [inaudible] responsible of the two-shared things as a result of shareholder lawsuits from the [inaudible] taxes. What we did last year was big class action settlement of $3 billion was finalized here in February and that's out. We have some opt-outs [ph] in that. State of New Jersey was part of that which continues to move that item, but there are a handful of other cases that were normal and overtime we could see some charges, but right now we have to defend our position on those, but [inaudible] there could be some other small charges.", "Yuri Krapivin - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our final question will be from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks. Guys, couple of follow-ups on, could you just talk about what sort of lead times are you getting from your customers on the Components side, but really the connector side especially? One of your peers actually talked about visibility shrinking to two weeks or so on their call, so, could you just talk about that?", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Our typical lead-time, I think, when you average is about a month. That really hasn't changed too much and of course it depends by end market. But we haven't seen any significant change there.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "All right. And then I may have missed this, but I know you guys bought 10 million shares up until the end of March quarter, could you just talk about how much you bought so far in the June quarter?", "Terrence Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, when you look at the June quarter since [inaudible] exhausted the first authorization to 750 basically is where we are at right about now.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "About 100 million incremental from June?", "Terrence Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Correct.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "All right. And then just finally, I think there was a press release out a few days ago on the $4 million settlement you had with the State of New York. Just to clarify that has nothing to do with the State of New York project, which you guys are underway right now, correct?", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "That's correct. We have been supporting, serving the state of New York in public safety for a long, long time and that was something we said is related to prior business.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Perfect. Thanks.", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome. Thanks, Amit.", "John Roselli - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Okay, we have no further questions?", "Operator", "Speakers, back to you. We have no questions.", "John Roselli - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Okay, great. Well, thanks everyone for joining the call. Keith Kolstrom and myself will be around for the rest of the day with any other questions.", "Tom Lynch - Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Terrence Curtin - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Bye-bye.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today.

At this time, all phone participants are in a listen-only mode. ", "Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. ", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations, John Roselli. Please go ahead, sir.", "John Roselli", "Thanks, Gail. Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Tyco Electronics first quarter results for fiscal year 2009, and our outlook for the second quarter. With me today is our Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch, and our Chief Financial Officer, Terrence Curtin. ", "During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask you to look at today's press release and read through the cautionary statement that we have included there. ", "In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning, and we ask you to read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. ", "The press release and all related tables can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website, at tycoelectronics.com. ", "Now let me turn the call over to Tom for some opening comments.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. I am going to give you an overview of our performance, and some headlines of what's going on in the business. Then I will turn it over to Terrence Curtin, who will walk you through our Q1 results in detail, and provide you a status of the cost actions we are taking in response to current conditions. ", "It is a bit of an understatement, but this is clearly a tough business environment and, in many ways, unprecedented. It does not feel good, frankly, but despite the circumstances I will talk a little bit more about this later on.", "I am glad we are in the kind of company that we are in. It that has financial strength; it is a leader. Besides driving cash and getting the cost out, the other key area we are focusing on is making sure that we really do come out with some competitive advantage after all of this. I will touch on some of the things we are doing in this regard further in the call. ", "Let me talk about the first quarter. We expected a tough first quarter, when we were on the call with you three months ago. It turned out to be even tougher than we thought, as a result of continuing and weakening demand through the quarter. ", "Most of this weakness was in our Component segment, where approximately two-thirds of our sales are related to consumer markets. This is the area that was hit most significantly in Q1.", "We saw, and we continue to see, weakness across virtually all our markets served by our Components segment, and it is in all regions of the world. Asia is just as soft as Europe right now. ", "In Q1, sales in this segment were down 25% year-over-year and orders were down 34%. Based on the current order levels, we expect the Component segment sales to decline in the neighborhood of 40% in Q2. This is an additional 15% decline from our Q1 revenue levels (inaudible) we expect them to be down about 40% in Q2. ", "You can see that across our Components business the weakness is very broad-based. However, we do have areas like aerospace and medical that are holding up okay. In our big markets, computer, appliance, Automotive, business is very soft. ", "Now, it is clear that we are being impacted by both end user demand and inventory reductions by our customers. This inventory reduction is pretty much occurring in every end market. Just to give you a little bit of a flavor; in our European Automotive business, our sales were down 36% organically in Q1, compared to European new car sales and production being down in the range of 20% to 25%. ", "Everybody in the chain is aggressively trying to adjust their inventories, not only in line with the current low levels of demand. Everybody is trying to preserve their liquidity situation. We are definitely in the middle of that, and we are feeling the effects of that in a big way. We do expect those inventory adjustments to continue through the second quarter. ", "In our other three segments; Networks, Wireless and Undersea, which serve primarily industrial and infrastructure markets and account for about 30% of our revenue, sales declined organically 6%. ", "Now these are longer cycle markets in nature and we would expect less volatility in demand. We are seeing our customers being increasingly cautious in their spending levels in the current environment. ", "Let me touch on each of them a little bit. In our Network segment, sales will be down about 10% year-over-year in Q2. Within the Energy and Telecom businesses, within that segment, sales will be down slightly. Again, the demand is holding up, and in our building networks business we are going to be down about 20%. We saw those trends in the building networks business start last quarter.", "Our Undersea, Telecom and our Wireless segments will be about flat with last year. In Undersea and Wireless, order rates continue to remain pretty solid. Overall, with this kind of demand environment and the inventory correction going on; Q2 is going to be weaker than Q1. ", "We currently expect that our Q2 sales would be in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion. This is a 32% to 35% decline from last year's $3.7 billion, and it is a sequential revenue decline of about 11% to 14%.", "Now, we are not sure how long this situation is going to last; I am not sure anybody is out there. We are taking a number of actions both to sort things up in the short-term, as well as to make sure that we come out with better leverage when the business starts growing. Fundamentally, we are very focused on improving our competitive position. It is not just about cost; we are also focusing on making sure we strengthen our competitive position.", "Let me go through a few of reasons why I feel despite the current circumstances, continue to feel very good about our prospects. As the world leader in interconnect, we are continuing to invest in new technologies, and we are also focused on improving our engineering productivity, so better solutions, faster, more products, those are very key to growing in this business.", "The long term drivers of our markets are still attractive. Of course, they do not feel so great right now. When you step back and when you look at what drives this business, which is fundamentally smarter electronics in almost every applications in the world, you know, it is a good business to be in. ", "These electronics enable new features. We all know about the drive for energy efficiency and alternative energy solutions. There's higher data speeds required in virtually all of our products; so this kind of fundamental dynamic, while slowing down right now, really plays to our strength because of the significant amount of resources we have in sales, marketing and engineering around the world.", "It is also a time when customers need to know that their key suppliers are financially viable. Not only that they are going to be here for the short term, but that they can continue to invest in innovation in years to come. I think there is no question that our customers can count on us for that. ", "We are seeing a little bit of evidence out there that the customers are starting to look to their strongest suppliers for new programs, and we are making sure we are going to be in a position to take advantage of that. ", "We also continue to make organizational changes, to strengthen our company for the long-term. We are taking four businesses with high growth potential our Aerospace, Medical, TouchSystems and Circuit Protection businesses, which are currently part of our Electronic Components segment, and are moving them into a newly created Specialty Products Group. ", "That is not the most creative name in the world, but the purpose of this move is to increase the focus on growth in these businesses and we have recently included a new leader to run this group. These businesses represent about $1.6 billion of annual revenue. We have a range of products in these businesses, and we expect that these will be high growth for us as things begin to return to normal. ", "In the second quarter, we will begin to report this Specialty Products Group as a separate new segment to give you more insight into what's going on there. ", "In addition, in other areas of organization as I discussed on the last call, we have combined two of our largest interconnect businesses within electronics Components, what we used to call our computer and communications business and our global industrial business. ", "We put them into one business late last calendar year. That merger, so-to-speak, is going very well, and we expect to get significant improvements in operating leverage, technology and market scale out of it. ", "Let me talk about our cost and productivity improvement plans. As you know, before we launched. ", "John Roselli", "We are going to actually move to a different location. We understand there is a lot of static on the other end. If you could just bear with us for a couple of minutes, we will be back on.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, once again, please remain on the line. Your host line will be re-established momentarily.", "John Roselli", "Thank you for holding. We apologize for that. We had a serious static issue in the previous room we were using. We are going to resume now. Tom's going to start at the beginning, and we will go through it. Please bear with us if you did hear clearly. Thanks.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks, everyone. I will speed it up a little bit on the first part of this. Apologize for that. I guess when it rains it pours. As I was saying, we expected a tough first quarter and it certainly turned out to be tougher than we thought, as a result of continued weakening in demand throughout the quarter. ", "This was felt especially in our Components segment, where approximately two-thirds of our sales are related to consumer markets, and in the first quarter it was the consumer-related businesses that were hit the hardest. ", "In Q1, sales in the segment were down 25% year-over-year and orders were down 34%. Based on this rate of orders, we expect Component segment sales to decline about 40% in Q2. This is an additional 15% decline, from our Q1 revenue levels, and of course as would you imagine, our Automotive business, which is our largest business is also going to be down about 40% in Q2. It was down 31%, organically in Q1.", "Now, it is pretty clear that this is a combination of weak end demand, coupled with significant inventory corrections going on. Everybody in the supply chain is trying to get their inventory in lines and shore up their liquidity as fast as possible which is exacerbating the inventory declines. ", "Just to give you a little bit of a flavor for this, European new car sales and production in our first quarter were down in the 20% to 25% range, and our volume was down 36%; so, clearly a significant inventory piece. ", "We are also seeing the same kind of adjustments in mobile phones and the computer end markets. We do expect that this trend is going to continue through the quarter, through the second quarter.", "In our other three segments; Networks, Wireless and Undersea, which serve primarily industrial and infrastructure markets and account for about 30% of our revenue, sales declined 6% organically. These markets are longer cycle in nature and we would expect less volatility in demand, but our customers are clearly being cautious in their spending levels, because of the uncertain environment. ", "Let me talk a little bit more specifically about these segments. In our networks segment, sales we will be down about 10% year-over-year in Q2. In energy and telecom, we will be down slightly and in enterprise, which is our building networks business we will be down about 20%. ", "In the Undersea, Telecom and Wireless segment, order levels so far are holding up, and we expect revenue to be about flat this last year. When you take all this into account, the weak demand environment, the inventory correction going on, Q2 is going to be a weaker quarter than Q1. ", "We currently expect that our Q2 sales will be in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion. This is a decline of about 32% to 35% from last year's $3.7 billion; and it is a sequential decline in the range of 11% to 14%. ", "Now, as I mentioned earlier, these are clearly really difficult times, and our business is definitely right in the middle of all these tough times. When I step back and look at the company from a distance; there are a lot of good things going on in the company. The fundamentals, once we get through this, will remain strong.", "I want to share just a few things, why I remain really bullish about our company. First and foremost, we are the leader in the interconnect industry, we continue to invest in new technologies and we are also focusing on improving engineering productivity. We need to continue to drive new solutions for the customers even though demand is way down. They need solutions that are integral to their architectures in the future. ", "The long-term market drivers are still attractive. Doesn't feel that way right now but, again, the demand for smarter electronics, which enable new features, energy efficiency or alternative energy solutions and higher data speeds in almost all applications, to name a few, is not going to slow down, and this plays to our strength with our 5,000, 6,000 sales folks out there calling on customers and our roughly 7,000 engineers designing products and introducing products into our factories. ", "In a time like this, it is really important that customers know that their key suppliers are financially viable and continue to invest. In this regard, we are beginning to see some early evidence that the key customers are looking more to their stronger suppliers for new programs, and we will be prepared to capitalize on that.", "We also continue to make organization changes to strengthen our company for the long term. We have recently taken four businesses with high growth potential; our Aerospace, Medical, TouchSystems and Circuit Protection business units and which are currently part of our Electronic Component segment, and are moving them into the newly-created Specialty Products group. ", "The purpose of this move is to increase the focus on growth in these businesses and we have also recently recruited a new leader from outside the company to run this group. Today, these businesses represent about $1.6 billion of annual revenue and they all have attractive growth characteristics and very nice product offerings, and this is a group of businesses that we have high expectations for. We will begin to report them as a separate segment in Q2.", "In addition, as I discussed on the last call, we have combined two of our largest interconnect businesses within Electronics Components, Computer, Communications and Industrial into one, in order to better leverage our operating technology and market scale. ", "The way to think about this new business is, it is principally an interconnect business, now that we have taken some of these other more niche businesses out of it and put them into Specialty Products. Let me touch briefly, and Terrence will cover this a little more later on, on our cost and productivity programs. ", "As you know, when we launched almost two years ago, this was a key focus of us, to restructure the company, especially our manufacturing footprints, so that we could increase our operating leverage. We've made good progress on the footprint simplification efforts. ", "By the end of this fiscal year, we expect to have less than 100 manufacturing facilities, and that represents a decrease of about 25% from where we were at the beginning of fiscal 2007.", "Admittedly, the benefits of these actions are a little hard to see right now, because at the rate at which the volume is declining, is overwhelming it a bit, but we are making good progress there in both taking the cost out and simplifying the business. ", "The key to these actions or really the goal of all these actions is to make sure that we can get to 12% operating margins at about a $12 billion sales level, which then will enable us as normal sales growth comes back, to continue to move towards our 15% operating income goal. We have not taken our eye off that. It is going to take a little bit longer obviously because of what's going on in the global economy. I still believe that in the mid-term, that is the right target for our company. ", "Last, but certainly not least, in this regard, we have a strong balance sheet, and I expect us to continue to generate solid cash flow, even at these low business levels. We did use cash in Q1, but this is typically our weakest quarter, as we come off our year-end, and frankly we are still chasing the business down from a production standpoint, so our inventory grew in the quarter. ", "If business were to continue at the Q2 levels, I would expect us to generate free cash flow in excess of $800 million, excluding cash restructuring outlays and that is $800 million for the year.", "A couple of other topics; as regards our wireless business, the State of New York contract: on January 15th, the state notified us that they were terminating the contract for the state-wide wireless network. This was not a surprise, but we believe that state's termination is improper and we stand by the system we delivered.", "Just a note, we have more than 400 systems currently in use in operations and we continue to win new projects. Our backlog is at the strongest level it is ever been in this business and in just the last two weeks we have won three important new strategic projects with an initial value of about $100 million.", "We also announced on January 14, that our Board had approved a proposed change of the company's place of incorporation from Bermuda to Switzerland. This proposed move is subject to shareholder approval and if approved, we would expect this would become effective during the second calendar quarter.", "Now, I am going to turn it over to Terrence Curtin, our CFO who will walk you through in more detail on our performance and then I will come back to talk about our outlook and answer your questions.", "Terrence Curtin", "Thanks, Tom and good morning everyone. Let me start by reviewing the sales performance by segment and end market, and then I will review our earnings, margins, cost actions and a few other items.", "Starting with our largest segment, Electronic Components, sales declined 25% in the quarter and were down 22% organically. The decline was broad-based with EMEA and Asia being down approximately 25% and the Americas being down 16%. These decreases were in almost all end markets, particularly hard-hit by the consumer related markets.", "Let me spend some time on the major consumer markets that we serve in the segment. In the Automotive market, our sales declined 35% overall and 31% organically. This was worse than we expected coming into the quarter as OEMs made deeper cuts in production to reduce vehicle inventory levels and this had a corresponding ripple effect throughout the entire supply chain.", "We estimate that global production was down 20% to 25% in the quarter. From a geography perspective, our sales in Europe declined 36% organically; North America, we experienced a 33% decline, and in Asia, we declined 22%. We do expect a further drop in global production in quarter two, particularly in Asia, where OEM production levels are forecast to be down as much as 40% year-over-year.", "In two other important consumer markets, computer and mobile phones, our sales declined 30% organically reflecting declines in both end unit demand coupled with supply chain adjustments. In the mobile area, despite the market slowdown, we continue to make good progress broadening our product offering, and our customer base in this market.", "Now, let me cover the major industrial and infrastructure markets served by Components. In the aerospace and defense market, we grew 1% organically. Sales to distributors, which account for approximately 40% of our sales in this market, were down much more than the overall market, as we saw distributors aggressively reduce their inventory positions.", "Order rates have slowed, particularly in the commercial portion of this market, and we do expect revenues in quarter two to be slightly down organically on a year-over-year basis. On a positive note, we have increased our content on new Boeing and Airbus platforms, and we expect to see the benefit from these wins later in our year.", "In the industrial equipment market which for us include traditional industrial equipment, HVAC, and building equipment as well as the solar programs we talked about, our sales were down 9% or an organic basis. Demand for these solar products that we sell, we still continue to see growth there, however we have seen the rates slow and then in the industrial equipment and commercial building side, these markets are certainly being impacted by the global slowdown and we do expect this to continue as people trim back on capital spending.", "Finally, in the communication infrastructure market, sales declined 13% organically. We do see these sales being impacted by lower capital spending by both businesses and telecom operators.", "Now, let me turn to our Network Solutions segment, where we had a sales decline of 11% on a reported basis and 2% organically. Sales to the energy market grew 3% organically in the quarter. We did experience solid growth in North America and emerging markets which more than offset a continued slowing in EMEA.", "The structural changes that we made in our go to market organization in North America over the past two years, we are now beginning to see the benefits as we are picking up share gain. This North America market in the energy space has historically been an under penetrated market for us.", "In the building networks market, our sales declined 5% organically. As we stated on the last call, order trends in this market have continued to slow as project delays have become more common, particularly projects related to new commercial construction. As Tom mentioned, we expect sales in this market to decline further in quarter two.", "Finally, our sales to the communications service provider market declined 5% organically. While we continue to see customers select to invest in fiber-to-the-home and broadband wireless projects, spending on upgrades and maintenance of existing networks, we have seen slowed.", "In our Undersea Telecommunications segment, as expected, sales declined 16% organically versus the prior year, due to the construction of the large transpacific project last year which is now complete.", "New project activity has slowed from last year's base but remains solid. Our backlog in the segment remains over $1 billion, and we continue to expect full year sales of approximately $900 million. For quarter two, we expect sales in this segment to be similar to quarter one levels.", "Finally, in our wireless system segment, our sales grew 5% organically, and we continue to build backlog as Tom mentioned.", "Now, let me talk about our operating income and margins. Overall, we had a loss from operations of $21 million on a GAAP basis. This loss included $78 million of restructuring costs, $111 million of charges related to the termination of our New York wireless project, and $17 million of litigation items. Adjusting for these items, our operating income was $185 million in the quarter and our adjusted operating margin was 6.6% compared to 13.9% in the prior year.", "The decline is driven almost entirely by our Component segment due to the significant sales decline, as well as approximately $50 million of hedging losses related to certain Eastern European currencies which I discussed on the last earnings call. These currency losses impacted our margin by 180 basis points. If you adjust for these hedging losses, our operating margin was 8.4% which is down 550 basis points over prior year.", "If you look at gross margin, our adjusted gross margin was 22%, compared to 25% in the prior year. Just to remind you, our research development and engineering expenses of approximately $150 million per quarter and that runs about 5% of sales at these revenue levels are included in gross margin.", "The main driver of the decline in gross margin was the 22% organic sales decline we experienced in our Components segment. In our other three segments, gross margins were flat with the prior year. Specifically, lower volumes reduced our gross margin by approximately 400 basis points. We were able to recover about 100 basis points through the cost actions, but we are not able to keep up with the pace of the volume decline.", "To give you a sense of the actions we were able to execute in the quarter, we reduced our manufacturing related headcount by 8,000 employees and total headcount by about 9,000 by the end of the first quarter. The reductions were through a combination of elimination of temporary workers, attrition, and a reduction in force.", "We do have additional actions in process and will continue to reduce our manufacturing costs where we can to adjust to the volume levels. Our current expectation is that we will reduce our headcount by approximately 20% for actions that we are taking and certainly that percentage will be higher in the manufacturing area than in the engineering, selling and G&A areas.", "The remaining reduction that we saw in operating margin was driven by negative leverage on our overhead structure. When you adjust for the currency losses that I mentioned previously, our adjusted SG&A was down approximately $20 million from the prior year but up as a percentage of sales as we were not able to reduce at the same pace as the sales decline.", "Now, our margins, both gross and operating will be lower as we move into quarter two as we see further volume declines and also we'd bring down our inventory levels.", "Now let me talk about the State of New York restructuring and litigation charges we recorded in the quarter, starting with the State of New York wireless contract. We recorded a $111 million charge related to the state's termination of the contract earlier this month. The charge includes a $61 million impairment of the assets, basically the assets we had on our balance sheet for the system, as well as a $50 million related to a payment to the state in January under a standby letter of credit.", "On restructuring, we incurred $78 million of charges which related primarily to a reduction of the employees as part of our cost actions. In the quarter we incurred $17 million of charges related to litigation. Of this, $9 million related to our share of settlements for the Tyco International legacy shareholder litigation and the remaining $8 million related to a several year old product liability matter in our Components segment.", "Now, looking at items below the operating line, net interest expense was $36 million in the quarter, which was down versus last year reflecting lower net debt levels. Our other income and expense was an expense of $1 million, which was worse than our estimate of approximately $13 million of income.", "The difference was due to one-time adjustment related to the tax sharing agreement with Tyco International and Covidien that negatively affected other income, but also reduced our income tax expense in the quarter.", "Our tax rate on adjusted income was 30% in the quarter. This rate is lower than guided as the non-taxable negative effect of the hedging losses was offset by a positive one-time adjustment to tax expense that I mentioned previously in other income. For the second quarter, we expect a similar tax rate as quarter one.", "Our cash taxes paid in the quarter were $64 million in and our cash tax rate on adjusted income was 43%. This is significantly higher than our typical 20% rate, as cash taxes paid in the quarter really relate to prior year tax returns where we had much higher income levels.", "Now, let me talk about cash flow. Cash flow from operations was $33 million and free cash flow was a use of $79 million. The decline in free cash flow compared to last year was primarily due to lower operating income and increased cash restructuring costs of approximately $40 million.", "Two areas I want to touch on are capital spending and inventory. On the capital side, we reduced spending from approximately $170 million per quarter run rate at the end of 2008 to $116 million in quarter one. We will continue to manage our capital spending at a lower rate, and I expect it will be below $500 million in 2009 compared to the $619 million we spent in 2008.", "On inventory, the rapid deterioration in demand prevented us from reducing inventory in the first quarter. With our sales level at these lower amounts, we would expect to see further liquidation of our working capital over the next several quarters, including a reduction of inventories to get more in line with current business levels.", "With respect to share repurchase, we used $125 million to repurchase $6 million of shares early in the quarter. We had approximately $600 million remaining on our share repurchase program at quarter end. We have suspended the repurchase of shares due to the uncertainty in the current economic environment and we expect to resume the program once market conditions stabilize.", "Now let me update you on the cost actions as we enter into the second quarter. Remember that on our last call we laid out cost improvement actions in three main areas; manufacturing simplification; secondly, SG&A overhead; and thirdly, commodity tailwinds.", "In the manufacturing simplification area we are making good progress, but these actions do take time to execute, particularly in Europe. We communicated that we expect $40 million in savings in 2009 from actions taken in prior years and these savings continue to be on track.", "On the SG&A front, we initiated $100 million of annualized cost reductions in the quarter. We expect to generate about another $10 million of savings from these actions in Q2 when compared to quarter one, and we will reach the full quarterly run rate by quarter three. We also remain fully on track in this area.", "Finally, with respect to metals, we expected a full year tailwind of approximately $75 million from the decline in copper prices. This tailwind will now be diluted by lower production volumes. When we look at the current volume levels where we are at, the inventory reduction efforts and considering the amount of copper that we fixed with our supply base coming into the year, full year savings would be approximately $25 million and would be achieved later in the year.", "Finally, for the second quarter, we expect to incur approximately $125 million of costs related to restructuring actions, including the initiation of two additional plant closures that we recently announced; one in the US and one in Europe. The majority of this charge relates to headcount reductions as we continue to reduce both manufacturing and indirect headcount in line with volume.", "We currently expect full 2009 costs to be about $250 million and we expect cash spending to also be approximately $250 million in 2009. The cash spending Component does include both current year actions and prior year actions. As Tom stated, the benefits of these actions in total should allow us to get back to an operating margin in the 12% plus range at a $12 billion annualized sales level.", "Now, let me turn it back to Tom.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks, Terrence. I am going to talk about Q2 and then wrap it up and we will open it up for questions. As I covered earlier, we expect our Q2 sales will be in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion, which is a 32% to 35% decline from last year's $3.7 billion. This sales decline coupled with our efforts to reduce our inventory will result in further reductions to our gross margin, as Terrence indicated. As a result, we expect the Electronic Components segment to have an adjusted operating loss in Q2.", "For the overall company, we expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.05 to $0.10, and when you include the impact of the restructuring costs, this will result in a GAAP loss of $0.10 to $0.15 per share.", "Now, while we are not giving full year guidance, I would expect if end demand in our customers' markets levels out even at these low levels, our sales should begin to recover sequentially in Q3 as inventories in the supply chain get back to a little more normal level. Clearly, it is too early to tell to say this with confidence right now.", "Just to summarize what I mentioned earlier, the strategy that we launched two years ago and the financial goals that we set out, which were basically to strengthen our portfolio, position the business to grow consistently at 5% to 7% and deliver a 15% operating earnings in fiscal 2010, are still the right goals for us. Obviously, the timeframe has changed because of what's been going on in the global economy. We have not taken our eye off these goals.", "In the meantime, we are focused on four key areas. One, ensure our liquidity and strong financial position by reducing inventory and carefully managing our capital expenditures. Two, continue to invest in engineering and key technology. It is the bread and butter of the company and one of the real strengths of the company. Our staying power in these kinds of times is going to enable us to continue that, although we will continue to drive efficiency in this area.", "Three, as Terrence took you through, continue to aggressively reduce costs, especially discretionary costs and accelerate structural efficiency. That is the big thing we are doing. Obviously, we are not spending anything. We do not have to. Beyond that, it is continuing to do things to make the company more efficient from a structural point of view like the org changes I talked about, certainly the expanded manufacturing and footprint simplification.", "Last, but not least, very high priority, make sure we capitalize on opportunities as they arise. As I mentioned earlier, in these times our long history with our customers is more important than it is ever been, and they know they can count on us. We are out there, reminding them of that everyday.", "We are certainly not alone in this environment, but I remain confident that with our solid competitive and financial position, we are going to be able to navigate through these times and we are going to emerge a stronger company when business improves. I realize that is easy to say, but I feel like the things that we have been driving for the last 18 months to two years, and that we are going to continue driving are paying off, it is hard to see in volume, in an environment when your sales are down 25% to 35%.", "With that, we will open it up for questions, and I apologize again for the technical problems.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions).", "We will go to Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Hi. Good morning. Looking at some of the additional restructuring announcements, as well as that 12% EBIT margin target, that requires, I guess, $12 billion in sales. What would you believe consolidated EBIT margins would be with the current sales run rate if we level out here in the June quarter?", "How much of these additional moves would flow into 2009 in terms of a dollar amount? Would any of these moves get the Electronics Components business back to break even in the June quarter?", "Tom Lynch", "Right now, with the actions we are taking, when we get through them all, and they do not all hit this year, it is about $300 million worth of cost savings. We would expect to be in the neighborhood of a $200 million savings run rate as we end the year. What that would do, if volumes stayed at our Q2 level, is to put us in the mid-single digit adjusted operating earnings range. What was the last part of your question?", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "It was about the incremental savings from some of the actions announced this quarter, and whether the Electronic Components business would be breakeven in the June quarter? It does not sound like it, at least from the initial commentary.", "Terrence Curtin", "Shawn, on that, certainly right now components is being hit very heavy with volume, as well as, as we go through and we reduce our inventories. When you look at that, with the cost actions Tom laid out, you know, it would be around breakeven where we are at certainly, it will also be dependent upon how fast we take our inventory out.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Okay. With the $200 million savings run rate, how much of that is incremental this year from what we have already witnessed in 2008?", "Terrence Curtin", "All of that is incremental.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Okay. Given the fact that you have suspended the share repurchase program, and maybe priorities for cash usage right now, or are you willing to let it build on the balance sheet until things begin to stabilize and then you start up the program again or do you have acquisition potentially you are looking at in this down market?", "Terrence Curtin", "Let me talk about one part, and then Tom can talk through the acquisitions. When you look at it, Tom mentioned $800 million of free cash flow if we stay at this level before restructuring cash. I mentioned there is about $250 million of restructuring cash that we will do as we go through these actions this year, and then certainly we have our dividend, which also runs about $290 million per year. They will be the first two priorities, Shawn. Capital above that, we will certainly retain as we go through this uncertain time. They are the priorities right now. Tom?", "Tom Lynch ", "That is absolutely right, maintain our liquidity, pay the dividends, but we continue to scan in these environments, because there are going to be, I think we talked about it last quarter as well, more opportunities. We are going to be very selective as we said. Up until now, most of our efforts have been strengthening the portfolio through divesting. Clearly, we believe that there are a number of areas that we are going to want to make acquisitions in, but we have to make sure we do first things first", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Just following up on that, there is been no discussion on looking at the dividend then at this point in time?", "Tom Lynch ", "No.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Tom Lynch ", "Thanks, Shawn.", "Operator", "We will go to Brian White with Collins Stewart. Please go ahead.", "Brian White - Collins Stewart", "Good morning. I am wondering if you could talk just a little bit more about the auto markets in terms of the inventory levels that you see there? Also some of the plant shutdowns, what did you see they the December quarter? Is this carrying into the month of January?", "Tom Lynch ", "Sure. There were unprecedented plant shutdowns over the holidays. Typically, many of the OEMs in the US and Europe will shut down for a couple weeks. I think the average was four to six weeks at virtually every major OEM in those two parts of the world. I am sure you have read about what is going on in Japan with Toyota shutting down and doing furloughs. It is pretty broad based right now.", "It feels like inventory is about twice as high as most of our customers would like it now. The shutdowns are starting to bleed that off and then the harness makers and the cams, the folks who make the subsystems, we actually get specked in by the OEMs, so we sell through them. They are working their inventory down as well.", "As I said earlier, if demand were to stabilize now, it is going to still take through the rest of this quarter and into part of the third quarter to get inventory levels balanced. Once that happens, then you should see our revenue start to track with end demand", "Brian White - Collins Stewart", "On the restructuring, I just want to be clear, when the down-sizing in the March quarter is finished, are you saying that in the last two quarters you reduced your workforce by 25%?", "Terrence Curtin", "20%. Some of that will happen in Q3, but when you look at that, we started the year right around 94,000 employees. You're basically going to have approximately 20,000 employees out, certainly, heavier weighted in the manufacturing area, as we bring down the manufacturing resources.", "Brian White - Collins Stewart", "Okay. Where is it more heavily weighted in terms of region of the world?", "Tom Lynch ", "Asia by far that is where we have the most of our labor intense production jobs, although there is some in the US. As you know, we have been adjusting the US footprint in the past for a while, a little bit in the US, quite a amount in Asia in Q1, a fair amount in Europe and Asia in Q2.", "Brian White - Collins Stewart", "Thank you.", "Tom Lynch ", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Banc of America. Please go ahead.", "Steven Fox - Bank of America", "Hi, good morning. A couple of questions; first of all just following up on the auto question, can you give us a sense of where you stand in terms of sales split between that go directly to OEM versus going to Tier 1 or harness makers, how much exposure do you have and how much inventory is that, which different level in the supply chain do you think?", "Tom Lynch ", "Most of our sales go to the harness makers and the cams as to Tier 1. We do not sell very much directly to the OEM. Although, the vast majority of what we do sell is specked in. The way it works is, we actually do the selling and the engineering early on in the architecture, heavily with the OEM, but the shipments actually go to the harness makers who attach the connectors or to the Tier 1, Boschs of the world, who put the headers together.", "Steven Fox - Bank of America", "Given that you are seeing more concern about those suppliers to the OEM, for instance, Visteon, there is been talk about Visteon potentially filing for bankruptcy. Can you talk about how you're protecting yourself, since it is a more fragmented customer base, how do you feel about your receivables there?", "Terrence Curtin", "Steve, it is Terrence. Number one, Visteon we have no exposure to it.", "Steven Fox - Bank of America", "Okay.", "Terrence Curtin", "Taken action previously with Visteon to make sure, we manage our credit risk. Certainly, we are monitoring across all of our industries, not just automotive or customers. When you look at our receivables, certainly our largest customer, which is in the automotive space, is less than 4% of our receivables. Our receivables continue to be good, collections are steady, but we are monitoring that actively. We have taken actions, like we did with Visteon, where appropriate. It is really a day-to-day monitoring that we are doing in this environment to protect ourselves.", "Steven Fox - Bank of America", "Great. That is very helpful. Just two clarifications; basically the restructuring that you just reviewed, I mean there were two plant closing announcements. Would you characterize everything on plan? There is been no acceleration of the plans or? It seems like everything is steady state with where you thought it would be about three months ago, is that fair?", "Terrence Curtin", "I think right now, Steve I would say it is on plan. As, you know, at the end of summer last year, we announced three significant actions in Europe. Still working through those; they are on plan. These two additional ones, we recently announced here. The bulk of the cost take out right now is just getting production levels in line with the current low levels of demand.", "Our intention is to accelerate some programs, if possible, that were originally intended in 2010 until later this year. We need to get through the five we have just announced in the last few months and the five that we were winding down before that. We have about 10 actions that we are closing out, as we speak.", "Steven Fox - Bank of America", "Okay, fair enough. Lastly, could you give some clarification on the decision to reduce your exposure to the commercial paper market in the quarter?", "Tom Lynch", "Steve, that reduction was done back in right when the commercial paper was disrupted back in October.", "Steven Fox - Bank of America", "Okay.", "Tom Lynch", "Actually, right after year-end and I believe we talked about in the last call. When the market got disrupted and it was challenged, we did go into our credit facility for about $190 million. We are in the commercial paper market actively, but we have had what we have put in our credit facility, we have maintained onto that. We still have access to the commercial paper market, and we anticipate we will.", "Terrence Curtin", "We did bring down debt about $200 million in the quarter. As what we are maintaining capital as Tom talked about.", "Steven Fox - Bank of America", "Okay. In other words, that whole change on the cash flow all appeared in October, when things were at the worst?", "Tom Lynch", "Correct.", "Steven Fox - Bank of America", "Okay. That is helpful. Thank you.", "Tom Lynch", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will go to Matt Sheerin with Thomas Weisel Partners. Please go ahead.", "Matt Sheerin - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Yes, thanks. I just want to ask a question regarding your revenue guidance and the confidence that you have it. In fact, the range looks a little bit more narrow considering that it looks like it is going to be very back-end loaded quarter. You talked about inventory reductions at your customers.", "Could you talk about the confidence that you have, what backlog looks like, what book-to-bill looks like in the areas where the range specifically in end-markets, where the range should be a little bit wider?", "Terrence Curtin", "If you look at our Components segment, we are going to be down about 40%. Clearly, that is the piece that is getting hit hardest. That reflects the order rates we have been seeing. The orders for the last few weeks coming out of the holiday time have settled in around where they were in November, before the holiday time. I mean, there is not enough data points there to call it a trend.", "I guess as much confidence as can you have in this environment, as well as based on what your backlog is. In our other businesses, the orders are softened. They are holding up and we are looking at their wireless and undersea being about flat. That is all in the backlog, for those two. That is not really contingent on any orders really at all. In our networks business, we are going to be down about 10%; that is a little softer than Q4.", "I think I feel reasonably confident. I mean it is a pretty low-level of business being off 35%. If you look at the dull weather of companies in the industries that we sell to, whether it is semiconductors or that could compare to handsets, automotive, their end demand is not down that much. A big part of this, as we mentioned earlier, is inventory correction, but it is hard to call, I mean.", "Matt Sheerin - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Yeah. Sure. It sounds like you have seen at least a little bit of stabilization in terms of daily order run rates even though it is at a much lower level?", "Terrence Curtin", "Yes, we have. I feel a lot better and we have a couple more weeks like that and starting with the beginning of December, we hadn't seen that until this point. That is what our forecast is based around.", "Matt Sheerin - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay, great. Just as a follow-up, concerning the pricing environment. Are you expecting customers to come out and are you expecting lower ASPs once volume orders come back?", "Tom Lynch", "We are going to see more price pressure. I think there is more, certainly customers are, when you go see them, they talk about hey, in this environment you need to give us lower prices. I mean, our position as well, the agreements we entered into with you were at volumes that were significantly higher. As you know, especially in the interconnect business, every particular project or opportunity is its own negotiation.", "Our Q1, our pricing did not deteriorate. It is pretty much held on, and that is one thing that we are being very disciplined about. We have to play it out. We do not want to lose good business, for sure. I would expect that there will be a little more price erosion. So far, we haven't seen it and we haven't lost any new awards, because we are not willing to drop price. It is something you have to watch every day.", "Matt Sheerin - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. Thank you.", "Tom Lynch", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will go to Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Jim Suva - Citi", "Thank you. Regarding your EPS outlook of a nickel to a dime, I understand that the inventory work down has a big impact. Maybe can you split out of how much inventory you expect to work down? What did that do to EPS and/or margins for the March quarter? Do you think it will be all worked through in the March quarter or is this multi-quarter work down that Tyco and the supply chain needs to work through?", "Tom Lynch", "If you look at the second quarter, we estimate right now that that will have about a 200 basis point impact on our margin as we work through our inventories. With what we are planning to, we will need probably more than a second quarter to work through it, to be fair. The plans that we have in place right now would be about a 200 basis point impact on our gross margin at that 2.4 to 2.5 level that we quoted. ", "I would anticipate, if we stay at that 2.5 level, around, we would need more time to work through inventory to continue to bring it down and continue to liquidate the working capital.", "Jim Suva - Citi", "Great. Regarding these tax sharing agreements that you have; can you remind us of how long they continue to go on? There has been a tremendous amount of volatility in the other income line as well as the tax sharing agreement and when we have you reincorporate to the other jurisdiction will that impact that at all?", "Terrence Curtin", "Yes, number one; let me take the second half of your question first. Moving to Switzerland from Bermuda does not change the tax sharing agreement. That relates to legacy Tyco liabilities that all three of us share. Just changing the jurisdiction of incorporation of our parent company does not impact that.", "These relate to open tax matters that go back to 1997, up to basically the date of separation. This will be ongoing for quite some time, as we go through audits, both in the US and in other places. You will see, as you have seen, some adjustments as matters are closed out or settled.", "What you saw in the quarter are other income that we guided, about 13% came down to $1 million of expense. Almost the exact same corresponding effect was the benefit in our income tax expense. Net-net it had a very negligible impact on EPS. I think it was about a penny. Due to how the arrangement is set up, we will continue to have volatility through that for quite some time.", "Jim Suva - Citi", "Quite great. As a housekeeping item, is there any precedence or have you been notified by Standard and Poor's about inclusion or exclusion the S&P 500 for this change?", "Operator", "Our next question will come from William Stein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "William Stein - Credit Suisse", "I'm going to wind up asking that one as well. First, I'd like to focus on inventory. Was kind of surprised, I think it was down slightly, but I think there was a $61 million write-down from state of New York, which would imply inventories excluding that actually grew in a quarter where sales were down pretty significantly sequentially. Can you help us understand how that happened?", "Terrence Curtin", "Let me handle the first part here. Inventories grew about $100 million, when you take out what you said, State of New York, when you look at the face of the balance sheet. You got to that take $61 million out. When you remove currency effects it grew slightly over $100 million. ", "It really was us trying to chase it down. When we started the quarter, we assumed we were going to be around $3 billion. That is where we were loaded to and really late in the quarters when it slipped. ", "From that viewpoint, we built inventory which now we have to work out like we talked about both in Q2, and if it stays at a lower level after that. From that viewpoint, that definitely inventory, when you look at the cash flow, is an area where when you look at working capital, we have to make ground up there, based upon where the market ran away from us in quarter one.", "Tom Lynch", "I would add to that Will, that we definitely cut production in Q1 versus Q4 of last year, but we did not cut it enough. I think it just a simple way of saying it. We were planning for that higher sales level and we just did not cut it enough. It is not an area that I think we shined on in the quarter.", "William Stein - Credit Suisse", "Based on the current guidance for the March revenue, can you give us an idea of where you are targeting inventories to wind up?", "Terrence Curtin", "Basically, we are shooting right now in the range of basically recovering about what we built in quarter one, to give you a range. Certainly, that varies by market and what we are trying to take out, but basically taking out what that build was in quarter one, which is in excess of $100 million, and certainly if we can do more we will.", "Tom Lynch", "Yeah, we are being aggressive at the same time. Not only is demand down, but the demand we are getting is more volatile than we have seen it. Releases particularly from our biggest customers are changing quite dramatically from what the backlog is. It is a challenging environment, but we are making progress on the inventory.", "William Stein - Credit Suisse", "Okay, and then just one follow-up if I can on the reincorporation. Can you give us a sense as to the timing on this, whether there is any impact on the P&L and whether you have considered that there may be a change in your index membership?", "Terrence Curtin", "Couple of things; timing-wise, we did file our S4 with the SEC. They have to review that and that is the process. As Tom mentioned, we would expect that we will be able to complete that in our fiscal Q3 or calendar Q2 as Tom mentioned. In that regard, we are on track for that. ", "When you look at impact to the financials, there really is none. When we did this move, we are moving to a place where we do have much more presence. It is in a big region, and from that viewpoint, similar to what I answered with Jim on the index incorporation we had not heard anything from S&P on that yet.", "William Stein - Credit Suisse", "Thank you.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks Will.", "Operator", "We will go to Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks a lot. Just a question on the Electronics Components side on the auto degradation you guys saw. Can you just talk about what the monthly trends were in the December quarter and how does the month of Jan look like so far?", "Tom Lynch", "I mean October was worse than September, November was worse than October, and while we expected December to be worse than November, it was a lot worse. We saw really around the 10th or 15th of December on, just the orders even orders that were ready to ship were put on hold. It was pretty drastic and it was over close to 45% down in December. ", "January, as I mentioned earlier, is leveling off a little bit. We haven't seen enough to feel like it has bottomed out yet. I wouldn't argue that, it hasn't either, but it is not materially better. The factories are just coming back on. The OEMs are really just coming back on line. I think it is going to take several more weeks to sense where we are really at with their end demand. ", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Got it. Could you just maybe talk about how do we think about the wireless business at this point, post the State of New York decision because my understanding is that it the only reason it was considered part of core operations was because we have that program?", "Terrence Curtin", "First of all, all along, we viewed the wireless business as one of these parts of the portfolio with very high growth potential, because the reason we have been able to grow the business at double-digit rates and build the backlog and even with the trials and tribulations of New York have won significant businesses, because we really have state-of-the-art solution there, that especially in today's time, the need for interoperability is really very important, and it is IP based. ", "It is really the only system that is being installed out there that is IP based which very much gives public safety communications leaders a lot of flexibility. Our wireless team understands this. We need to have high growth, high margin profile for this business in order for us to keep investing in it. ", "We are all disappointed with the New York situation, but the team has ploughed through there and continued to win important deals. I think that is the most important thing for us right now, is to deliver on the other business we have and work through this dispute we have with New York.", "Tom Lynch", "Go ahead, sorry, Amit.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "I just had one quick one now. If you look at the last 10-K, it looks like the international pension plan is under funded by $670 million or so. Could you just talk about any thoughts on topping that off or is there any issue we should be aware of with regard to the international pension plan at least?", "Terrence Curtin", "Let me take that, Amit. When you look at the international pension plan, you can't think about the international pension plans like we think about US plans. Most of these plans do not have trusts and they are not funded plans, which is just how the plans are structured internationally. Certainly, it will be a commitment over time, but you do not do contributions to the vast majority of our international plan. ", "Most of our funding relates to the US plan, which was previously fully funded and is now slightly under-funded based upon market movements. But, the international plans really would not make contributions of any substance.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "All right. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Terrence Curtin", "Thanks, Amit.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks, Amit", "John Roselli", "", "We have time for two more questions, please.", "Operator", "We will go to Carter Shoop with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Carter Shoop - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning, just a couple of quick clarifications and then one question. When you talked about the free cash flow goals of $800 million at existing levels, was that existing 1Q levels or where you expected to be in 2Q. If it is for where you are in 1Q; what's your expectations given what we know about 2Q?", "Tom Lynch", "It is based on second quarter level, Carter.", "Carter Shoop - Deutsche Bank", " ", "Okay, great.", "Tom Lynch", "The key, as you know, is working off the working capital.", "Terrence Curtin", "Right.", "Carter Shoop - Deutsche Bank", "Were you saying that you expect to reduce inventory by the $100 million that you have built in 2Q or is that in addition to the normal inventory reduction in conjunction with the sales decline?", "Terrence Curtin", "It will be to basically burn off what we built in quarter one by the end of Q2 and then certainly we will have to continue to go above that and some of that may come in Q2 or Q3.", "Carter Shoop - Deutsche Bank", "Despite the sales decline, do you expect inventory to only decrease by about $100 million?", "Terrence Curtin", "It is about 150.", "Carter Shoop - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Lastly, why aren't we getting a little bit more aggressive here on the restructuring, given what we are seeing on the sales side? I know there is a lot of facilities in Europe where it takes 12 plus months to restructure, etcetera, but why aren't we trying to accelerate this sooner versus waiting until the second half of the year?", "Terrence Curtin", "Well, we have added two more in the US. We have three under way in Western Europe, which is quite a lot actually at one time. Because despite the volumes being down, we still have to be able to close the factories and the challenge there is it takes such a long time to work through with it you're always nip and tuck and then introduce those products into the receiving factory. ", "Our intention, as I said earlier, I think we said at last quarter too is definitely along those lines, to bring more restructuring in, but we have to get these three done or substantially complete and we are making good progress. ", "We are getting to a lot of the really critical milestones. You have to avoid the strikes and things like that. Even with volume being as much as it is down, if we would have a prolonged strike or something it would be pretty painful.", "We are making good progress there. Our intention is to definitely take advantage of the weakness out there and do more.", "Carter Shoop - Deutsche Bank", "Would you say that management bandwidth at this point is the key bottleneck for more restructuring? Not necessarily just at the executive suite but in general.", "Tom Lynch", "It is risk reward. It is a balancing risk reward. I do not want to have more than three Western European auto plants in a state of transition at once. It is very, very expensive if you have a problem. You do not deliver for the customers, that is expensive in your reputation and it is expensive, and the penalties you could face and we have been avoiding that so far.", "We just really want to get further along on these and sort of be in to the last quarter of the game, so to speak on these, and then continue to move aggressively, because that is our plan.", "Carter Shoop - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Last question; you talked about a 12% operating margin at a $12 billion run rate. Looks like for the second quarter you'll be at roughly at $10 billion run rate. Would you be willing to comment on where that operating margin can go after the current restructuring is implemented at a $10 billion run rate?", "Carter Shoop - Deutsche Bank", "Yes, for the balance of the year on the second half of the year as I indicated. I think about mid-single digits. If we were to stay at $10 billion, obviously would have to do more and I would say you'd start moving up toward high single-digits.", "Carter Shoop - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "John Roselli ", "Okay. Well just one more question. ", "Operator", "We will go to Amitabh Passi with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Amitabh Passi - UBS", "Hi, thanks. I had a couple of clarifications, and then just a couple of quick questions. The first one was Terrence, I guess for you, the $0.05 to $0.10 guidance that you gave for the second quarter for EPS, I just wanted to confirm that there are no incremental losses anticipated in relation to currency hedges.", "Terrence Curtin", "", "None.", "Amitabh Passi - UBS ", "Okay. You might have given this, I missed it. I think you talked about a $250 million figure for full year '09 as far as your restructuring charges, cash restructuring charges. Did you give a number for the second quarter?", "Terrence Curtin", "We did not. It is for the full year. Certainly we are in the middle of executing. I would say the second quarter will be higher than about the $50 million we had in quarter one, but it will be how they execute out. I believe, right now, it will be between $50 million and $100 million for quarter two.", "Amitabh Passi - UBS ", "Okay, great, thanks. Tom, this is for you. If indeed we were to see demand trends stabilizing a little bit, how do you envision sort of a potential restocking in the channel? Would you expect sort of a more gradual buildup as we progress through the rest of the year or could we potentially see a snapback for a quarter before we get back to a more gradual ramp?", "Tom Lynch", "", "I think it would be more gradual given what everybody is going through. I think it is going to take a while for people to believe it is actually coming back. That is my own view.", "Amitabh Passi - UBS ", "Okay, and then just my final question. I was hoping you could maybe help understand the dynamics in your Communication Equipment segment within Electronic Components and your Comp Service Provider segment within Network Solutions. One was down 5%, the other down 20%. Just any color in terms of the dynamics in those two areas?", "Tom Lynch", "Com equipment, that was down about 13% organically. Certainly, we are seeing on the com equipment side the inventory that we talked about in the channel and demand, we are seeing obviously the Telco operators spending being down about 5%, projected, as well as businesses cutting back on capital. ", "When you look at the communications service provider, what we saw in the quarter was slowing in US spending, but we did see some pickup in certain European carriers that for the past about year or so we have not seen. I would say the focus really is on fiber investment. ", "When you look at it, one is the com equipment would both have a business element as well as a telecom operator element, whereas the service provider is all telecom operator.", "Terrence Curtin", "The one portion of our networks business that was down 20% is our Enterprise or our building networks piece. That is a combination of new building construction really having slowed, and especially we are feeling it in the financial services market as IT spending has been cut really way back in light of the circumstances in that market. That is the one that was down 20.", "Amitabh Passi - UBS ", "Okay. Got it. Thank you.", "Terrence Curtin", "Thanks a lot. Thank you, Amit.", "John Roselli", "Okay. With that we will wrap up the call. Once again we apologize for the technical difficulties. Keith Kolstrom and I will be around all day to answer any follow-up questions. Thanks for joining us again and everyone have a good day.", "Terrence Curtin", "Thanks everyone.", "Tom Lynch", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 11:00 AM Eastern Time today through February 4th at midnight.

(Operator Instructions)  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Vice President of Investor Relations John Roselli.", "John Roselli", "", "Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Tyco Electronics\u2019 third quarter results for fiscal year 2009 and our outlook for the fourth quarter.  With me today is our Chief Executive Officer Tom Lynch and our Chief Financial Officer Terrence Curtin.  During the course of this call we will be providing certain forward-looking information.  We ask you to look at today\u2019s press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary statements that we\u2019ve included there.", "In addition we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items.  The press release and related tables along with the slide presentation can be found on the investor relations portion of our website at www.TycoElectronics.com.  ", "Now, let me turn the call over to Tom for some opening comments.  ", "Thomas J. Lynch ", "Q3 was a good solid quarter for the company for several reasons.  Sales increased 7% sequentially and exceeded our original guidance primarily due to increased demand for our products which served consumer markets especially in the automotive market.  While sales are well below last year\u2019s level it does appear that the inventory correction in the consumer markets is largely behind us.  As a data point automotive year-over-year was down 36% for us but sequentially us up a little over 25%.  Total company orders were up 14% sequentially and the book-to-build ratio was 1.4 excluding the undersea telecommunications business.  ", "The aggressive cost actions that we initiated early this year coupled with our footprint reduction actions have improved our operating leverage and our strategic footprint restructuring actions continue to be on track and at the pace we\u2019re at we\u2019ll be less than 100 facilities by the end of the year.  As you know, improving margin flow through in the business has been a very, very critical objective for us and continues to be a critical objective and we\u2019re making good progress.  ", "If you take these productive and cost actions in conjunction with the sales increase this has enabled us to increase our adjusted operating income by $55 million or about 76% sequentially and this exceeded both our original and revised guidance.  We also reduced inventory and additional $264 million in Q3 and to date we\u2019ve reduced it about $1.5 billion.  This was the primary driver behind our strong free cash flow in the quarter which exceeded $300 million for the second quarter in a row and we now expect free cash flow before restructuring to exceed $1 billion this fiscal year.  This is a $200  million increase to our prior outlook.", "We strengthened our balance sheet in the quarter by reducing our debt levels by $336 million and in July we completed a tender offer which reduced our debt by an additional $152 million.  As of today we have reduced our debt by approximately $725,000,000 this year.  Our debt stands right around $2.4 billion today and to put it in a little perspective, if the business were to stay at this range we\u2019d ideally like the debt to be in the $2.0 to $2.2 billion range so we\u2019re closing in on what we think is the appropriate level of debt for this level of business.", "As you all know, we completed the sale of our wireless system business for $665 million cash and all-in-all I think we\u2019ve made excellent progress over the past two years focusing the portfolio around our core connectivity business.  I really feel good about this portfolio and the growth opportunities we have and how we\u2019re positioned.  ", "This morning we also issued another press release announcing that our board of directors recommends for shareholder approval a dividend of $0.16 per share for each of our first two fiscal quarters of 2010 and this would be in December and March.  Shareholder approval of dividend payments is required as a result of our reincorporation to Switzerland.  We decided to retain our dividend at this level despite the reduction in business levels over the past nine months because of our strong cash position, the strength of the balance sheet and the progress we have made in reducing costs and improving productivity.", "Now, I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Terrence who is going to go through our Q3 performance in more detail.", "Terrence R. Curtin ", "I\u2019ll start by reviewing our sales performance by segment and market and then I\u2019ll get in to earnings, cash flow and liquidity.  If you could look at Slide Four of the slide presentation, this shows our overall revenue performance by segment both year-over-year and sequentially.  Our total company sales of $2.5 billion were down 34% in the quarter versus the prior year of which the effect of currency translation was approximately 400 basis points of decline.  Sales were up 7% sequentially with three out of our four segments showing sequential growth.", "In our businesses that serve the consumer markets which are about half of our sales, while we are still down year-over-year, we did see sales increase over 20% sequentially and as Tom mentioned it appears the inventory adjustments in the supply chain are largely behind us.  In the industrial markets that we serve we continue to see weakness as sales were down 2% sequentially.  These industrial markets are continuing to be affected by lower capital investment levels and we expect this trend to continue in the near term.", "Now, let me get in to segment performance by market, please turn to Slide Five.  In our electronic components segment versus the prior year sales declined 42% overall and 37% organically and we saw broad based declines across all markets and regions on a year-on-year basis.  In the consumer related end markets which are about 70% of this segments sales, we did see revenue growth 20% organically on a sequential basis.  ", "Getting in to the specifics by the major markets we serve, in the automotive market, our sales versus the prior year did decline 36% organically however sequential sales were up 28% organically.  We estimate global auto production increased 10% to 15% sequentially and we also benefited from supply chain restocking.  Our sequential sales increase was driven entirely by our Asia and European regions.  For quarter four in this market we expect sequential improvement in the top line again of mid to high single digit growth on what we estimate to be flat sequential global production and the growth will be driven by further restocking.", "In the computer market of the component segment our sales declined 42% organically year-on-year driven by end market declines as well as our continued selectivity on new programs particularly in the commoditized portion of this market.  On a sequential basis sales were down slightly.  In the communication market, our organic sales declined 28% year-over-year and were up 4% sequentially and as you know, we put both communication equipment and mobile phones in here.  The year-over-year decline was driven by the communication equipment market where sales organically were down 34% and except for China the global market continues to be very soft.", "In the mobile phone portion of the communications market, our organic sales were down 16% versus prior year but were up 35% sequentially.  As expected supply chain inventory stabilized and our revenue decline in the quarter was in line with global OEM production declines.  In the industrial equipment markets our organic sales growth was down 51% versus the prior year and down 14% sequentially.  As we discussed on the last call, we expected declines in this market due to the reduced capital spending on factory automation and infrastructure globally.  We have seen order rates stabilize and we expect sales will be relatively flat in this market sequentially in the fourth quarter.  ", "Finally, in the distribution channel our sales declined 39% organically versus the prior year due to continued inventory reductions by distributors.  Orders did big to show some signs of improvement late in the quarter and we expect Q4 sales to be similar to Q3 levels. ", "Looking at the right side of the Slide to our network solutions segment, versus the prior year sales declined 26% overall and 17% organically driven by capital spending reductions.  Sequentially sales were up 6% overall and 2% organically.  We do expect segment sales in the fourth quarter to be flat with quarter three.  In the markets, sales to the energy market were down 15% organically versus the prior year.  Utility customers, particularly in Europe continue to defer spending on upgrades and maintenance.  Sales were flat sequentially compared to the second quarter and we did not see the usual seasonal pick up that begins in our third quarter and continues in to the fourth quarter.  We expect this trend to continue and we expect quarter four revenues to be flat sequentially.", "Our sales to the service provider market declined 12% organically driven by lower spending on upgrades and maintenance of existing networks in the US and Europe and a slowdown of fiber investment in the US.  In quarter four we do expect a sequential decline driven by lower fiber network investments in Europe.  Lastly, in the enterprise networks market, our sales declined 27% organically reflecting weak US and Europe commercial construction markets and reduced IT spending.  We do expect a modest sequential increase in the fourth quarter as a result of some of our program wins we\u2019ve had both in Europe and the US.", "Let\u2019s turn to Slide Six to cover the specialty products and undersea telecom segments.  Sales in the specialty products segment declined 27% overall and 24% organically versus the prior year.  Sequentially sales were down 2% overall and down 3% organically.  For the fourth quarter we expect the segment sales to be similar to quarter three.  Sales in the aerospace, defense and marine market declined 20% organically versus the prior year driven by both distributor inventory reductions and weaker demand in the commercial aerospace market due to aircraft cancellations and push outs.", "In this market we declined 6% sequentially and while we\u2019ve seen order stabilize in the distributor channel of this market, we are seeing signs of weakness in the end markets.  We expect quarter four to show further declines versus the third quarter.  In our touch systems business, sales were down 33% organically versus the prior year due to continued weak capital spending by retailers.  Orders have strengthened in this business and we expect a double digit increase sequentially.  ", "In the medical products area, sales decreased 13% organically versus the prior year and we continue to be affected by capital spending cuts among healthcare providers.  We expect this market to be down slightly on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter.  Finally, in our circuit protection area, organic sales declined 34% versus the prior year but were up 33% sequentially as sales to the consumer related end market such as automotive and mobile phones showed improvement.  Similar to the consumer markets that we serve in our electronic components market, we expect that we\u2019ll continue to see growth in our circuit protection business in Q4 sequentially.", "Looking at the right side of the chart, in our undersea telecommunications segment, organic sales increased 15% versus the prior year and 3% sequentially drive by our continued strong execution on projects in the Middle East, Africa and Southeast Asia.  In addition, as included in our revised guidance, we also benefitted in the quarter in both revenue and earnings by approximately $20 million due to the receipt of cash from a customer that we previously were concerned may not be collectable.  This caused our operating margin during the quarter to be about 23% in the segment which is higher than normal.", "We ended the quarter with a backlog of $811 million in this business which was a decrease of $275 million from the end of last quarter.  Bid activity on new projects remained solid but the funding for these projects remained uncertain.  For quarter four we expect our sales to decline sequentially to about $280 million and we expect our margins to be in the mid to high teens.   ", "Now, let me go from sales and turn to the income statement which starts on Slide Seven.  Our GAAP operating income for the quarter was $64 million which includes restructuring and other costs of $63 million.  These restructuring costs relate to both footprint and headcount reduction actions that we previously initiated and no new plant closures which started in the third quarter.  Adjusted operating income in the quarter was $127 million with an adjusted operated margin of 5.1% which is solid improvement from Q2 levels of 3.1%.  Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.17 which is up 21% in the second quarter.  While operating income was up 76% sequentially, adjusted EPS was only up 21% due to income tax expense in the third quarter versus tax income last quarter.  ", "Moving on to Slide Eight, beginning in this quarter we have reclassified research and development and engineering expenses out of cost of sales and are showing it as a separate line below gross margin to provide more clarity and we have restated all periods presented for this reclassification change.  If you look at the top of the Slide, versus the prior year, gross margins declined 600 basis points from 29% to 23%.  Volume declines due to the 34% decline in our sales reduced gross margins by 900 basis points.  We also continued to reduce our inventory levels in the quarter which reduced production by approximately 40% compared to the prior year.", "The impacts of lower production levels reduced gross margin by 300 basis points.  Our cost reductions partially offset the negative effects of the volume and the production cuts.  The savings from our implemented actions helped gross margins by 600 basis points.  Looking at our gross margin compared to the prior quarter in the upper right hand quarter, margins benefited from 200 basis points associated with volume increases as well as 100 basis points of additional cost savings.  ", "Inventory reductions lowered gross margins by 300 basis points and offset the cost and volume benefits.  Operating expenses which are shown in the middle of the Slide and include both RD&E and SG&A were down $101 million year-on-year.  Excluding the effects of currency translation, we reduced operating expenses by approximately $70 million through a combination of headcount reductions and spending controls. As expected operating expenses were flat versus the second quarter and we expect that they will be at a similar level in quarter four.", "Finally, we continue to be on track for our overall target of removing approximately $300 million of annualized structural cost of our businesses and this consists of $200 million in the manufacturing area and $100 million of operating expenses and we expect to exit the fiscal year at the full savings run rate.  As I discussed on the last call, these actions position our company for solid to upper single digit adjusted operating margins at current sales levels.", "With respect to our manufacturing footprint, six closures are in process and they\u2019re on track with what we communicated last quarter and we expect we will have less than 100 manufacturing sites by the end of this year.  As you may remember, this is down from the 133 facilities when we started the program back in 2007.  ", "Moving to Slide Nine, let me discuss the items on the P&L below the operating line.  Net interest expense was $38 million and this was flat versus the prior year.  We do expect that this will come down to $34 million in the fourth quarter as a result of lower debt levels.  As I discussed last quarter and as I provided in the guidance, the amount and mix of our income by countries where have operations has changed considerably since we ended the fiscal year and this has resulted in a lower than expected tax expense in the third quarter and has created volatility in our tax rate.  This is evidenced by the 16% adjusted income tax rate we have in the third quarter.", "In the fourth quarter as earnings increase the rate should not be as volatile but will be lower than normal.  We expect an adjusted tax rate in the fourth quarter of approximately 25%.  Finally, other income which relates to our tax sharing agreement was $5 million in the quarter up from $1 million in the prior year.  For quarter four I expect this will be approximately $11 million of income.", "Now, let me turn to free cash flow on Slide 10.  As Tom stated, our free cash flow was $327 million in the quarter up from $262 million in the prior year quarter.  Lower income levels were more than offset by reduced inventories and capital spending.  We continued to make progress in managing our working capital.  Our days sales outstanding declined three days year-over-year and two days sequentially as we continued to see improvement in our receivables aging from our credit and collection efforts.  Our inventory days on hand excluding construction and progress were down six days year-over-year and down 17 days sequentially to 67 days.", "On capital spending, we spent $61 million in the third quarter of 63% reduction from prior year levels.  On a year-to-date basis our capital expenditures are down 39% which is in line with the revenue declines.  For the full year, we do expect capital spending of about $350 million.  Cash restructuring in the quarter was $80 million and we continue to expect full year cash restructuring in the range of $300 million.  Finally, based upon our strong traction over the past six months, as Tom indicated we are increasing our 2009 fee cash flow before restructuring outlook to $1 billion from our prior outlook of $800 million.", "Now, let\u2019s move to Slide 11 to discuss liquidity and debt.  Starting with cash we began the quarter with $700 million of cash and ended the quarter with $1.26 billion.  During the quarter in addition to free cash flow we received the proceeds from the wireless business sale of $665 million which includes the working capital adjustment under the contract.  From a use of cash perspective, we paid off the balance of the credit facility which was approximately $340 million, paid dividends of $74 million and made cash payments related to pre-separation litigation of $15 million.  The litigation payment as you may recall was related to the P&L charge of $135 million we took last quarter.  We still have $85 million of cash payments related to these charges that we expect to payout through 2010.  ", "Turning to debt, at quarter end our debt balance was $2.6 billion, down from $3.2 billion last year.  As I stated earlier, we no longer have anything outstanding on our credit facility and in the fourth quarter our debt will go down by an additional $152 million due to the recently completed debt tender.  After the tender we will have about $2.4 billion of debt outstanding.  We feel very good about our liquidity position and we will continue to retain additional cash in these uncertain times for flexibility and to make sure we can support all of our strategic options.  ", "Now, let me turn the call back over to Tom.", "Thomas J. Lynch ", "Let me now turn to the fourth quarter, if you can flip to Slide 12.  In Q4 we expect our sales to be in the range of $2.53 to $2.63 billion and this is up slightly versus Q3.  We expect continued improvement in consumer markets and flat sales in industrial markets and this will be partially offset by an approximate 10% decline in our undersea telecommunication segment.  As you know, we have been talking about that business slowing down for fiscal \u201908 and fiscal \u201909.  It\u2019s been over $1 billion, we are starting to see a little bit of a slowdown there now as expected.", "We do expect our adjusted operating income to be in the $160 million to $200 million range.  The significant improvement in sequential profitability is primarily due to continued benefits from our cost savings actions, our ongoing productivity improvement program and the less negative impact on margins from production cuts to balance inventory.  Our adjusted operating income margin will be in the 6.3% to 7.5% range in the quarter and that\u2019s up from about 5% in Q3 and about 3% in Q2 so we\u2019re making good progress there.  Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations will be in the $0.22 to $0.29 range which is up from 17% in the third quarter.  As with prior years, we\u2019ll provide further insight in to 2010 on our next earnings call.  ", "If you move to Slide 13 now I\u2019ll just wrap up before we open it up for questions.  Really importantly we\u2019ve resized the business to improve our operating leverage and have positioned the company to deliver solid mid to high digit adjusted operating margin at the $10 billion sales level and at 12% adjusted operating margin at the $12 billion sales level.  This is what we\u2019ve been talking about the last couple of quarters as we\u2019ve gone through the resizing.  This is what we thought is the right balance to strike to maintain a good solid performance even in these difficult times, generate significant cash flow but increase our opportunities for growth in the future.", "I feel like we\u2019re doing that pretty well.  We continue to execute our strategic restructuring and of course maintaining our ability to grow.  This restructuring coupled with our increased focus on core productivity is really going to serve us well as growth comes back.  As Terrence mentioned the cash flow and balance sheet remains strong and this really enables us to preserve our key strategic options which are increasing our investment in organic growth, we feel there are more opportunities today than there were a year ago: bolt on acquisitions which can leverage our business platform, maintaining our investment grade rating; and of course returning capital that we don\u2019t use for strategic purposes to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.", "With that, we\u2019ll close off this part of the call and open up for questions.  ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from Matt Sheerin \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners, LLC.", "Matt Sheerin \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners, LLC", "I guess my question Tom has to do with the margin, the incremental margin contribution, going forward obviously you\u2019re seeing a big step function up in the September quarter on the inventory reduction and the cost kicking in but as you go forward once the restocking period is over, what should we think about the incremental margin contribution or variable margin going forward on incremental dollar growth?  And, you\u2019ve stated in the past that your goal is to get to 12% operating margin at a $12 billion run rate, is that still on track or is that $12 billion even lower now given that you\u2019ve seen a big jump up here?", "Thomas J. Lynch ", "No, it\u2019s still on track.  I think we\u2019d be getting ahead of ourselves to say that we\u2019re getting ahead of that rate.  I mean, we continue to work the opportunities to improve the margin and the margin improvement this year has been largely from resizing in response to the downturn and the benefits of the restructuring that\u2019s been ongoing for a couple of years.  We still have more restructuring to do so we have a little bit of lift there.  I think the biggest margin improvement we\u2019ll get going forward is we\u2019ll have better flow through on the volumes.  That\u2019s been the highest priority I\u2019d in the company over the last couple of years.  ", "We got sidetracked by the decline in the economy but fundamentally to improve the operating leverage so that ties in to that $12 and our ultimate, well not ultimate in a sense, but we have not taken our eye of the goal of 15% margin but we\u2019re tracking now to 12%.  I\u2019d say the other way to think about that is last year when were at the $14 to $15 billion sales range, the actions we have now taken over the last 18 months or so position us to have our margins a couple of hundred basis points higher than they would have been at that range.  So, we\u2019re making good progress.", "Matt Sheerin \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners, LLC", "As you do see volumes increase what should we be looking at in terms of additional headcount?  As of today, what is your manufacturing capacity and headcount capacity able to produce in terms of revenue?", "Thomas J. Lynch ", "Well, capacity has several elements to it.  I would say we have plenty capacity in terms of bricks and mortar.  The variable capacity in our business is tooling and people.  So, we believe that we could support 5% to 6% organic growth without much growth in our manufacturing work force.  That\u2019s really the marching orders we have through the company that we ought to be able to get that kind of productivity.  Now, as we grow we\u2019re going to have definitely some costs feed back in, we\u2019ve been in short term work in parts of the world, things like that and the business is picking up so that\u2019s starting to change a bit.  But, I don\u2019t feel we have any capacity limiters and I do feel we should get this acceleration in margin as the volume picks up because of that operating leverage I talked about.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets.", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "I had a question, if I look at the auto business for the June and September quarter you guys are obviously benefitting from some supply chain restocking helping you guys out but as you sense that post September most of this restocking benefit will be behind us and from there on auto sales for Tyco should reflect end demand, is there any concern that much of the strength you see in the first half in June and September is really due to the scrapage laws in Europe that are probably pulling in demand from the back half to the first half?", "Thomas J. Lynch ", "I think your first point Amit is a very fair point, that\u2019s what we feel is by September we\u2019re going to be pretty much through the inventory balancing in the supply chain.  We do see, to your point, some lift around the world, I think it\u2019s for different reasons, there\u2019s a little bit of benefit from stimulus.  It\u2019s hard to get exact figures around that but I think that\u2019s definitely \u2013 we\u2019re not concerned about it, we\u2019re happy about it but I think in terms of how we manage the business we\u2019re not anticipating the kind of sequential increases we saw in Q2 to Q3.  ", "I think we anticipate kind of a more normal growth coming back and as we talked to all of our customers, in fact, there was just a note today that Denso, who is a big supplier to the OEMs is now going back to full work week so I think there\u2019s a lot of signs out there but not enough to feel like demand is really getting back at a fully robust rate but it\u2019s better than it was for sure.  ", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Then another question on your dividend policy, there\u2019s been some discussion there and I realize today that since you\u2019re committing to two more quarters of dividend payouts but as yearend demand continues to hold the way it is, is there a desire or commitment to maintain the current dividend deal?  And, is there any talks about possibly restarting the buyback program we have?", "Terrence R. Curtin ", "When we look at it Amit one thing is when we look at it, when you use the word dividend yield, we look at it from cash generation and where is our balance sheet and our cash generation.  So, when we look at it that is our earnings and our cash generation to it.  So, from a yield perspective, while that\u2019s something we look at that is not the way we set it.  I want to make sure on the dividend side \u2013", "Thomas J. Lynch ", "It\u2019s more of a payout ratio is the way we think about it, to Terrence\u2019s point.", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Maybe I just missed it but I\u2019m trying to get a sense on the 61st and annual dividend payout we have, if demand remains the way it is, is there a commitment to maintain that beyond the two quarters we\u2019re talking about?  ", "Thomas J. Lynch ", "Yes, the intention is to maintain it at $0.16 per quarter.  One of the little complexities of Switzerland is opposed to a Bermuda company or most companies where the board approves dividends rather, shareholders approve is so it makes the process more encumbersome, that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing two quarters but we\u2019re also not doing a full year and our next annual meeting will be in the February/March timeframe next year.  Our intention would be to get back on sort of annual cycle but yes, our intention is to keep the dividend.  If business got worse or didn\u2019t get any better or if we were going to be in a low period, of course we\u2019d revaluate it but that\u2019s now how we feel right now and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve continued it through this year.", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Then just a question, are we possibly looking to restart the buyback program?", "Thomas J. Lynch ", "I would say eventually, probably subject to the board approval but not in the short term.  I think we want to  maintain our flexibility in the short term.  I mentioned earlier when I talked about the debt level, we made great progress bringing it down.  If the business doesn\u2019t improve we have a little bit to go on the debt so we need to keep that flexibility.  We also want to keep flexibility for the bolt on acquisitions that fit in to the strategic sweet spots that we would like to fill out.  But, having said that, I think you know from our track record that we\u2019re not going to let cash build up and we\u2019re certainly not going to let it burn a hole in our pockets.  So, as cash build ups if we don\u2019t have better options we would certainly reinstitute the buyback program that we have in a sense on the shelf now.  We have $600 million left on the program that was approved by the board last year.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research.", "Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research", "Two questions on just incremental savings rolling on, should we expect the entire inventory drag, the 300 bips or about $75 million to essentially roll off as we move in here to the September quarter, is that what the guidance implies?", "Terrence R. Curtin ", "If you look at there will be a little bit carrying in but the vast majority is like we said we\u2019ve made better progress these past two quarters and we will get some pickup in quarter four but it will be essentially behind us.", "Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research", "So it could be a $60 million plus?", "Terrence R. Curtin ", "Yes.", "Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research", "Second, on the restructuring savings, I know that you had previously talked about $150 million of savings incremental in 2010.  Is that the number we should be using to model or is that something a little bit lower now?", "Terrence R. Curtin ", "We look at that from a footprint perspective, from a run rate off of quarter four there is just taking quarter four the run rate, there is from some of the factory items that we\u2019re wrapping up there is about $60 million incremental off of the quarter four run rate.", "Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research", "So $60 million annual off the quarter four run rate?", "Terrence R. Curtin ", "Yes.", "Thomas J. Lynch ", "[Inaudible] Shawn was really the full benefit on an annualized basis of the original program.", "Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research", "Then how much incremental are we seeing fourth quarter from third quarter?", "Terrence R. Curtin ", "It\u2019s about 100 basis points and it\u2019s mainly in the gross margin as I stated.  Operating expenses we\u2019ve been able to get that down but on the cost side Q3 to Q4 it\u2019s about 100 basis points. ", "Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research", "Then I know last call we talked somewhat about copper not really being a benefit to you anymore.  With copper at $2.60 probably having worked through most of your raw material inventory now, should we not expect any incremental benefit from lower raw material prices in the back half of the calendar year?", "Thomas J. Lynch ", "As you indicated we did fix positions late in \u201908 that we worked off and they\u2019ll be worked off through basically the end of this fiscal year.  We are averaging if you take the year between those fixed positions and where we do do some market purchases, we\u2019re at a $2.60 to $2.70 level so right now the benefit rolling over will be fairly minimal and we are starting to look at fixing in positions in to 2010.", "Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research", "Then one last question given the commentary on copper, what are you seeing in the broader interconnect pricing environment?  And maybe if you can talk about pricing in some of the other businesses as well?", "Thomas J. Lynch ", "In the core interconnect business lots of desire for price reductions from customers, not anything that is really new but no real change in price erosion.  I think what\u2019s balancing that is there\u2019s been a lot of stress on a number of the suppliers to the OEMs in various industries during the last nine months so a lot of effort is around making sure I have suppliers that can get me through this period of time.  Certainly, I\u2019d say that\u2019s one of our strong  - as well as keep investing in development.  So, we haven\u2019t experienced any really change in price erosion.", "Terrence R. Curtin ", "I mean Shawn it\u2019s still about 1.5% just to give you a number and that really has not moved.  It sort of varies by market but it really has been very consistently now basically this year and last year.  So, it really has not moved to Tom\u2019s point.  ", "Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research", "That was 1.5% annual?", "Terrence R. Curtin ", "Correct.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Steven B. Fox \u2013 CLSA \u2013 Calyon Securities.", "Steven B. Fox \u2013 CLSA \u2013 Calyon Securities", "A couple of questions, getting back to the auto can you isolate on the trends in auto demand in Asia how much of that was restocking versus real growth?  Then also if you can talk on auto about what the mix of the content looks like per vehicle, if there\u2019s anything that you\u2019ve been able to dissect on that, that would be helpful?", "Thomas J. Lynch ", "Well, let me talk mix a little bit, there\u2019s a slight change in mix I would say and we kind of estimate it at a couple of dollar impact on content.  Right now there\u2019s a little bit higher proportion of smaller cars with less features being sold.  We do believe that\u2019s something that will work its way through and its happened in the past during maybe circumstances that weren\u2019t maybe this crazy as the last nine months so, slight so far there Steve.  I would say in terms of Asia, I mean definitely China that had a month or two of declining auto sales stimulated quickly through a number of ways, change taxes on certain priced cars and that business is really very robust again, we\u2019re very strong there Tyco Electronics.", "Getting a little bit better in Japan I would say both in the local market as well as the exports. That feels more inventory correction related.  I was in Korea a couple of weeks ago, I would say a little bit of both, a little more inventory still.  I\u2019d say in general in all of the consumer markets, the sequential benefit is definitely in the two thirds to three quarters inventory but there is some improvement in end demand.", "Steven B. Fox \u2013 CLSA \u2013 Calyon Securities", "Then on the network solutions business looked like it had a little bit more leverage quarter-over-quarter than I would have expected.  Can you talk about how you got the improvement if there are any one offs and what we should be looking for on networking solutions margins going forward?", "Terrence R. Curtin ", "A couple of things, both in specialty products and network solutions you saw nice sequential increases.  They both had benefits of our cost actions, our cost actions were across all our businesses except UT, not just the electronic components.  They also did bring down inventory so they both did get the benefit of some of the inventory burn turning as well as cost actions.  The incremental that you do see in network solutions has to do with a little bit of a favorable mix because the service provider market grew a little bit faster so there is a little mix but there isn\u2019t any other one offs there.", "Steven B. Fox \u2013 CLSA \u2013 Calyon Securities", "Then lastly, if you were going to look at a tax rate for next fiscal year, any suggestions on what to use?", "Terrence R. Curtin ", "Tax rate when you look at it certainly our tax rate, like I said, has been very volatile as the business has swung through these income levels it certainly impacts pretax income.  When we started the year we told you about 30%.  We have continued to work on planning and we\u2019ll give you full guidance in the next call but I think right now using in the 28% to 30% range pending our formal guidance and insights for next year I think is a reasonable assumption.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Jim Suva \u2013 Citigroup.", "Jim Suva \u2013 Citigroup", "When you guys talked about the destocking of inventory is pretty much over, I just want to be clear for the September quarter are you envisioning a restocking or just stability?", "Thomas J. Lynch ", "I\u2019d say more stability Jim.  There\u2019s a little bit of restocking going on but inventories were so much higher than the level of business as the market collapsed so quickly particularly in automotive.  I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen \u2013 certainly everybody got a little tighter than they would normally be on inventory but I can think of just how we\u2019re managing our own inventory, we\u2019re not going in to restocking mode, our reductions are starting to flatten out.  I think that\u2019s the way we see it with most of our customers.", "Jim Suva \u2013 Citigroup", "Then on the automotive side you guys have done a lot to right size your business, cut down costs and things like that, for the September quarter what type of annualized global automotive run rate are you running the business for, for the September quarter?", "Terrence R. Curtin ", "If you look at it right now Jim, when you look at it global production in the fourth quarter is going to be about 13.5 million units is our estimate.  We do see that having the potential to inch up about 60 million units for next year as we\u2019ve told you just as the consumer and production get back in line which is pretty flat production quarter-on-quarter from Q3 to Q4 so our production estimate is about 13.5, our capacity is above that but that\u2019s right now how we\u2019re seeing it and we do expect to grow about 6% to 7% sequentially.", "Jim Suva \u2013 Citigroup", "Then if we go from 13.5 more towards and annual run rate of 60 million, you would likely see more benefit from the positive leverage flow through?", "Terrence R. Curtin ", "Exactly.  If you look at it, Tom talked about our component business getting to profitability and around these business levels we think it\u2019s a mid single digit profitability but then you get the volume leverage that we believe will be very significant that Tom talked about.", "Jim Suva \u2013 Citigroup", "My last question is, and not for guidance, but you guys have done a lot of divesting of businesses throughout the several quarters.  Can you help us understand the normal seasonality of your company in aggregate now kind of as the quarter\u2019s progress through the fiscal or calendar year?", "Thomas J. Lynch ", "It\u2019s tough to say what\u2019s normal after what we\u2019ve been through this year Jim.  A lot of seasonality has been thrown out the door.  Our wireless business, really from a seasonality, the wireless business that we sold, the only thing that was unique about that was it always had a big September quarter.  If you look at the rest of the business without that and assuming a return to what we did historically, typically our third quarter will be out strongest.  We do get impacted in the other quarters by holidays and seasonality but still quarter four and quarter one maybe 5% off of that but quarter three which is our June quarter would be our strongest in a normal time.", "Jim Suva \u2013 Citigroup", "The last point, along that line, you mentioned stepping away from some of the computer businesses, the commodity side, is there still more to go on that or is that pretty much behind us?", "Thomas J. Lynch ", "I think most of it is behind us Jim.  As you know, we\u2019ve been working on that for a couple of years to get out of the real low value add.  I mean, our products still span the range I would say of complexity and there\u2019s still pretty wide margin ranges across the portfolio and it\u2019s not our goal to get out of every low end product.  What we wanted to get out of was products that we didn\u2019t really add any engineering or manufacturing to it because we can\u2019t distinguish ourselves that way and we\u2019d rather have those resources on other projects because as you know we\u2019re a project intensive business.  So I guess the simple answer is yes, most of that is behind us.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from William Stein \u2013 Credit Suisse.", "William Stein \u2013 Credit Suisse", "I\u2019m wondering if you can give us a brief update on the M&A strategy going ahead?  You talked about potentially doing something to fill in some holes in the portfolio, any comments on how that might progress going forward?", "Thomas J. Lynch ", "As you know the last couple of years the focus has really been get the portfolio much tighter and I feel like we\u2019ve done that around our core connectivity business that serves devices and automotive and networks.  So now that we have that \u2013 at the same time we have looked at acquisitions and have been building a pipeline that has been derivative of our strategy and I\u2019d say our pipeline is pretty robust right now.  We\u2019re scanning and looking at a number of things but it\u2019s focused in a couple of areas.", "As we\u2019ve said before, areas that would compliment us.  We like energy for sure, we like medical, we have good positions there, we\u2019d like to build on those positions.  I think generally speaking it\u2019s rounding out markets where we don\u2019t have a full product line and that\u2019s how we think about it.  When I think about what percentage of our business, it feels like a 2% to 3% of our revenue and obviously maybe one year it will be one and maybe one year it will be 5% will make sense when we look at where we want to go strategically and what\u2019s out there.", "We haven\u2019t done any yet, we\u2019ve been active in a few, we passed on a few because either it turned out as we got in to them they weren\u2019t what we thought or we weren\u2019t willing to pay the premium but I think it\u2019s definitely an important part of our strategy going forward.", "William Stein \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Any chance that you\u2019d do something bigger than that and maybe even a public company or is that officially out of the cards?", "Thomas J. Lynch ", "I would never say never, I would say is there a chance?  Yes.  Is it at the top of our priority list?  No, because if you go across the markets we\u2019re in and the technology we have and again, we\u2019re more than just a connector company, we like what we have.  Our biggest opportunity to create value is to leverage what we have and augment it so I really feel like M&A in the midterm for us is more of an augmentation strategy not necessarily a big deal, transform the company, strategy.  But, I\u2019d never say never because things come up and you get smarter as you go.  But, that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it right now.", "William Stein \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Then an update on the distribution strategy please?", "Thomas J. Lynch ", "As you know, about a year or year and a half ago we felt like we needed to be much more strategic and frankly much more effective through that channel so we\u2019ve been on a pretty intense program to do that.  We\u2019re making good progress, we have reduced the number of distributors over the last three months that we serve.  We still serve them with our products but I think most of those customers and partners will be better off as we simplify our channel and therefore we can focus our efforts on the bigger distributors and do a better job.  So, I feel good about that.  ", "You can\u2019t really see it in the numbers yet because obviously the business has been down and the channel has been correcting inventories and Terrence talked to that a little bit, we think that\u2019s largely behind us.  But, I definitely feel like our relationships with strategic partners in that channel around the world are better than they were a year ago.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS.", "Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS", "Just a couple of questions, the first one being for you Terrence, on the balance sheet once you\u2019ve redeemed the $150 million plus or so of debt would you be largely done with most of the balance sheet restructuring or do you think you\u2019ll probably continue to pay down debt further?", "Terrence R. Curtin ", "Tom mentioned, where we are today, we\u2019re probably at the high end of the range if we stay at the revenue where we are now and as you saw in the tender we went out with a $350 tender, we had a $150 submitted so there could be a couple of hundred million more that we do depending on business levels.  So, there could be a little bit more that we do, that\u2019s why Tom talked about the flexibility of holding more cash in these uncertain times but we are close to being done.", "Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS", "Then how do you foresee working capital movements in the fourth quarter?", "Terrence R. Curtin ", "Working capital in the fourth quarter, on the revenue we do view we will take a little bit more out of inventory but other than that we expect working capital to be fairly flat quarter on quarter.", "Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS", "Then Tom just for you a couple of sort of strategic questions, I guess the first one was just any thoughts on the recent acquisition of [SCI America] by [Hubble], does that from your perspective indicate anything on one of your competitors or just curious to see what your thoughts were on that?", "Thomas J. Lynch ", "We obviously were aware of what was going on there but other than that we really don\u2019t have too much to add.  As I said, we\u2019re active.  You could call us active and selective.", "Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS", "Then just one final question, on your network solutions, I\u2019m just trying to understand, what is the value add for you to remain invested in some of the businesses like building networks and the comp service provider where there are certainly much larger competitors in that space, I mean is that an area you remain fairly committed to?  Then, how do you see the synergies flowing out with the rest of your sort of interconnect and component business?", "Thomas J. Lynch ", "I think the networks business is one of the things that makes us much more and we like this a lot, sort of a device interconnect company.  Of course, that\u2019s our core business but if you look at our core technologies and out of our networks business we really lead with our kind of material science expertise and in our connector business we lead with our mechanical and contact physics expertise but they come together and they definitely come together in the enterprise business.", "We\u2019re one of the top three players in the world and our enterprise or net connect business, that\u2019s a $400 to $500 million business, very attractive business for us, a business that we have a lot of momentum in.  Those technologies come together in our energy business which is in the neighborhood of $1 billion in normal times, it\u2019s down a little this year.   We\u2019re strong around the world in the energy business and we really love the prospects for that business.  ", "In the telecom portion of the business or what we sometimes call our outdoor plant business which is copper and fiber interconnect business in the outside plant and we sell to companies, the big carriers around the world, that\u2019s been a very good business for us.  It\u2019s been down and lumpy the last couple of years and it tends to fluctuation with the acceleration and deceleration in fiber deployments.  But, we like all three of those businesses and the technologies are very linked so we like being this very broad based connectivity business.  Those network business is roughly $2 billion in sales with historically very attractive margins and in the future we believe very attractive margins and have been very solid during this last year. ", "Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS", "I do have one final one, on the aerospace and defense, you talked about some weakness in the end market, I suspect some of that was driven by commercial aerospace weakness and likely [inaudible] continued to destock.  I\u2019m just curious what you\u2019re seeing on the defense side of that business?", "Thomas J. Lynch ", "Relatively flat, that\u2019s holding up better than the commercial aerospace business.  This is another business that we like a lot, we invested in over the last few years, we broke it out as its own standalone business unit a few years ago.  I think we mentioned on the call last time that we have significantly increased our content on all the new platforms on commercial aerospace and the two big providers there and we\u2019ve also increased our content in the defense side on a lot of the new military vehicles.  Now, that\u2019s not showing up in sales yet, that will show up as the platforms begin to shift but we like that business.  As you know, that\u2019s attractive businesses, it\u2019s long cycle, it\u2019s hard to be displaced from that business and it requires a lot of technology.  A lot of our advanced material technology starts there and then moves in to other parts of our business.", "Operator", "", "Your last question comes from Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets.", "", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "", "I had a quick follow up guys, on the computer segment, sales were down a little bit sequentially, could you just quantify how much of that was due to these programs that we exited?", "Terrence R. Curtin ", "How much of the decline?", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Yes, because in general right most of the computer PC supply chain is doing fairly positive as we\u2019ve seen from good sequential growth so I\u2019m just trying to understand the delta, how much of this is because of businesses that you walked away from?", "Thomas J. Lynch ", "Most of it is from us exiting the business.  The lion\u2019s share of that is from existing the business.  We\u2019re doing pretty well in our core platforms in that business but all the potpourri of all the other things we had either \u2013 we raised prices basically the last couple of years and most of that has gone away which was our intention, if we couldn\u2019t keep the price.", "John Roselli ", "", "Thank you very much for the time and [inaudible] and myself will be around all day for any follow up questions you have.

Guess you could definitely say 2009 was a challenging year but I feel we really navigated through it very well and we finished strong in Q4 with sales, earnings and cash flow above guidance. Just like to take a second here to thank our 75,000 people across the world for really pulling together during these times and responding to the challenge. I'll briefly recap some highlights of the year and Q4 and then I'll cover the overall market environment before I turn it over to Terrence, we'll go through our Q4 results in more detail. ", "To recap Q4, sequentially sales increased 8% overall and 15% in our electronics component segment. As expected, consumer markets such as auto, computer, mobile phone and appliances showed solid increases and this offset the expected decline in our Undersea Telecom segment. ", "Total company orders were up 25% sequentially with strength across the majority of our end-markets excluding Undersea, bookings were up 12% sequentially and the book-to-bill ratio was 1.05. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $221 million, an increase of 74% sequentially and importantly our adjusted operating margins improved again 300 basis points to 8.2%. We also had another quarter of strong cash flow, generating 600 million this quarter; this included a $200 million inventory reduction for the third quarter in row. ", "As we entered in and went through the downturn we had four overriding objectives: resize the company to be able to deliver 12% operating margins of $12 billion of revenue. We felt this was the striking the right balance of preserving the tremendous opportunities we feel we have while making sure the company stayed solid. We wanted to accelerate the restructuring program we started two years ago, of course keep the balance sheet strong and stay focused on our strategic growth initiatives.", "I feel we made very good progress against all of these objectives. Our cost reduction actions in response to the downturn combined with strong execution of the strategic restructuring program we initiated, like before separation generated 300 million of annualized cost savings. And this adds us on track to deliver 12% operating margin at the $12 billion revenue level, what we refer to as 12 to12. With respect to restructuring, we ended the year with 97 manufacturing facilities, versus a 133 when we launched the program. And this is a little ahead of where we expected to be.", "We also made significant progress in focusing our portfolio around our core connectivity businesses by divesting the wireless systems and battery businesses during the year. And this substantially completes the plan we initiated two years ago. ", "We generated 1.2 billion in free cash flow during the year, driven by working capital turnover improvement and a substantial reduction in CapEx spending.", "Clearly, when the business falls of, you do get the positive impact of working capital liquidation, but more than that we improved our working capital turnover. And this free cash flow was a little more than three times adjusted net income in fiscal '09. Divestitures also contributed approximately 700 million in cash and addition to the free cash flow. So, this strong cash generation enable us to maintain our dividend, reduce our debt by 800 million and end the year with a cash position of about $1.5 billion.", "I think just as important, despite all the disruption caused by the economy, the team also stayed focused on our growth strategy, and made good progress strengthening our product offerings across most of our businesses, and over the last six months two year, we've had some very key new platform wins in automotive with our alternative power and activity systems, our high voltage energy, product line that we recently introduced, some key new wins on the new airliners, and the commercial airliners and aerospace and defense and across our communications businesses.", "Let me now shift to talk a little bit about what we are seeing in our end markets. Our Q4 was our second straight quarter of sequential revenue growth and as I mentioned earlier the bulk of this was in our consumer related markets due to rebuilding of inventory and some increase in demand, and we clearly showed the benefit of stimulus in the automotive industry in all regions of the world.", "As we enter our new fiscal year, we are in the first month of that actually second month. The visibility is still limited but we are feeling a bit more confident about the improving trends in our key markets. And let me talk about a few of those key markets.", "In Automotive global vehicle production grew for the second quarter in a row that's the September quarter to approximately 15 million vehicles. Total production in our full fiscal '09 was about 55 million vehicles. Our automotive sales were up 24% in the second half of the fiscal year, compared to our first half. Primarily, due to the stimulus programs and the restoration of more normal production and inventory levels and as you have recalled when the business went down it went down very hard and very fast and inventory was just taken right out of the system, though we are seeing the rebuild of those inventory levels.", "Encouragingly, our automotive orders in October have remained consistent with what we experienced in Q4. From an industry perspective the latest outlook is that production levels will increase to about 60 million units in our fiscal 2010 which is an increase of approximately 10% over the 2009 levels. And if you saw the October US sales results came out, those annualized results are about inline with a global 60 million unit production level.", "The increase from 55 to 60 will be, the majority of that increase will be in Asia and that we have a very strong position across all the Asian markets. And in general, with respect to the automotive business, we continue to be very bullish, because no matter where you go and I was in India two weeks ago electronic content is increasing. Whether it's a small car or a luxury car the electronics content is increasing around the world.", "In our other consumer businesses, which include PCs, handsets, consumer electronics and appliances, we are also seeing a pick up in demand for the second quarter in a row. Again, I think this is inventory being restored in the channel, but we are seeing some in-demand pickup especially in emerging markets. ", "In our infrastructure businesses, which are largely in our Network Solutions segment and this includes our energy enterprise and telecom networks business and demand remains sluggish as companies continue to hold back on their CapEx spending similar to what we've done people aren't spending capital unless they have to. We do think things have bottomed out there and but we don't expect to any pickup until the second half of our fiscal 2010, which would be in the April-May timeframe. ", "In our Undersea business project, activity remained pretty vibrant as telecom operators continue to add bandwidth and redundancy particularly in emerging markets. However, the size of the project as we expected is declining a bit and we do expect the business is going to be down from the billion dollar sales levels of the past two years. Still a very healthy business, but the past two years have been banner years and the business is going to come off that level a bit. ", "Finally in our two key markets, industrial equipment, we're seeing some signs of recovery that went down hard last quarter and the quarter before, lagged consumer a little bit. It is bottomed out and is picking up sequentially a bit. And in our aerospace and defense business,  sales continue to be a little soft as air travels down and airline production private and commercial is down.", "But overall, although business is still down from the 2008 levels, we are seeing improvement and much more consistency in order patterns. Clearly, order levels in our Q1 and Q2 of our current new fiscal year is going to provide a much clearer indicator of where we are in the recovery. So those are going to be two critical points, but no question from our prospective. Things feel better than six months ago and even three months ago. ", "With that, I'll turn it over to Terrence and he'll take us through Q4 in more detail.", "Terrence Curtin ", "Thanks, Tom and good morning everyone. I'll start with slide 4 in the slide presentation, and I'll start by reviewing our sales performance by segment in market, then I'll review our earnings cash flow and liquidity.", "On the slide, this shows our overall revenue performance by segment both year-over-year and sequentially. Total company sales of $2.7 billion were down 25% in the quarter versus the prior year. Sequentially sales were up 8% with three of our four segments showing growth. The effects of currency translation added 300 basis points to the sequential growth and our businesses that served the consumer markets which is about half of our corporation. Sales increased 17% sequentially. Industrial and infrastructure markets that Tom mentioned continue to show sluggishness, but they do appear to have stabilized, as sales were flat sequentially.", "Let's turn to slide 5, and I'll cover the segment performance by market, and unless I indicate otherwise, all discussions I'll talk about will be organic. If you look at the left hand side of the slide, sales in our Electronic Component segment declined 24% versus the prior year, with declines across all markets and regions.", "Sequentially however, we did see sales increase 12% driven by the strength in consumer related markets that Tom talked about. To go into the major markets in this segment, in the automotive market, our sales versus the prior year declined 15% however sequentially, sales were up 14%. We estimate global auto production was up approximately 8%, sequentially which this benefited from the global incentive programs.", "We also saw additional sales in this market from the continued restocking and the supply chain. Sales sequentially increased in all regions with particular strength in North America and in Asia. For quarter one, we expect mid to high single digit revenue growth sequentially, reflecting further increases in production as well as the positive effects of currency translations. ", "In the computer market, our sales declined 37% versus the prior year and on a sequential basis, sales were up 10% which was essentially in line with end unit shipment data. In the communications market, our sales declined 30% year-over-year more than 1% sequentially. In the communication equipment market, revenues were down 38% versus the prior year and 7% sequentially. In the mobile phone area, the communications market, we saw a decline of 16% versus the prior year with growth of 10% sequentially essentially in line with the global OEM production levels. ", "In the industrial equipment market, sales were down 41% versus the prior year, but up 19% sequentially. During the fourth quarter, order rates began to improve and we expect the slight sales improvement sequentially into the first quarter. And finally, in the distribution channel, our sales declined 29% versus the prior year but we're up 12% sequentially. The order rates have improved in the channel consistent with the trends in other markets and we expect mid single growth sequentially for quarter one. ", "Turning to our Network Solutions segment on the right side of the slide, sales declined 18% versus the prior year driven by continued capital spending reduction by our customers. Sequentially, sales were essentially flat. Now, while there has been a lot of news about stimulus programs in the markets that serve by our Networks segment, we have not seen any significant effect in our sales. We do expect segment sales for the first quarter to be down slightly compared to our fourth quarter. ", "In the energy market, our sales were down 15% versus the prior year driven by lower spending and inventory reductions at utility customers but we did see sales up 3% sequentially. We're expecting quarter one revenues to be similar to quarter four levels. Our sales for the service provider market declined 22% versus the prior year and 13% sequentially due to a slowdown in wire line capital investment in all region, especially in Europe. In quarter one, we expect the mid single digit decline sequentially in this market. And in our enterprise networks market, our sales declined 20% reflecting weak commercial construction markets. Revenues were up 6% sequentially as a result to program wins and we expect our quarter one sales to this market to be flat sequentially. ", "Turning to slide 6 to cover specialty products Undersea Telecom. Sales in our specialty products segment, which is shown on the left side, declined 22% overall versus the prior year. Sequentially, sales were up 4% and for the first quarter we expect segment sales to be similar to the quarter four levels. Sales for the aerospace, defense and marine market declined 23% versus the prior year driven by continued weakness in the commercial aerospace market that Tom talked about.", "Revenues decline 4% on a sequential basis and while commercial aerospace remains challenging, we have seen sales to the distribution channels at this market which is about 30% of our business stabilize during the fourth quarter. In our touch systems business, sales were down 25% versus the prior year due to capital spending declines in the retail market. However as expected, business strengthened sequentially with revenues up 11% driven by growth in the retail and industrial markets. ", "Turning to our medical products business. Sales decreased 16% versus the prior year as we continue to be affected by reduced spending by medical equipment customers. Revenues were down 2% sequentially. ", "And lastly, in our circuit protection area, sales declined 19% versus prior year or were up 24% sequentially. As sales to the consumer related end markets such as automotive and mobile phones continue to improve, consistent with the trends we're seeing in the consumer markets and the component segment.", "Now looking at the right side of the chart, in our Undersea Telecom segment, sales declined 11% versus the prior year and 16% sequentially to $268 million. We did book a project in the Middle East called [Gov. Ridge] for approximately $300 million in the quarter. We expect to begin work on this project in the second quarter and this project will continue into fiscal 2011. This project solidifies our expectation for full year sales in the $600 million to $700 million range. Bid activity has improved recently and if we're able to win additional projects over the next six months, it could provide upside to this range depending on the timing of the project.", "We ended the quarter with the backlog of $920 million which was an increase of about $100 million from the end of quarter three and for quarter one, we expect sales of approximately $200 million with margin in the mid teens.", "Now, let me discuss earnings which starts on slide 7. Our GAAP operating income for the quarter was $176 million which includes restructuring and other cost of $45 million. These cost included a $33 million of cost primarily related to both footprint and headcount reduction actions that we previously initiated. In addition, we signed an agreement to sell a small business in our Network Solutions segment and incurred a $12 million impairment charge in the quarter related to this divestiture. This business had annual sales of about $50 million with operating margins in the low to mid single digits. We expect this divestiture to close by the end of the calendar year. ", "Adjusted operating income was $221 million with an adjusted operating margin of 8.2%. This is the second consecutive quarter of solid improvement as our adjusted operating margins have grown from 3% in our second quarter to 5% in the third quarter for the current 8% level. We are solidly profitable in all four of our segments and the fall through on the sequential sales increase continues to show the benefit of our actions. ", "Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.30 a share, which is up 76% from the third quarter reflecting the growth in the operating income. In addition to the restructuring and the impairment charges I just mentioned, adjusting items also included a $0.04 gain on the early retirement at debt related to our debt tender completed at the beginning of the quarter. This is reflected in our P&L as a $22 million gain in other income and $3 million expense in interest expense. ", "The gain reflects both a discount from the tender price versus the par value of the bond and the unamortized gains on the debt retired. We also had a $0.09 of tax items which reflects the effect of various tax matters in the quarter including a tax settlement under our tax sharing agreement. I will provide further details on this later. ", "Let's move to slide 8. Looking at the top side of this slide, our gross margin declined 200 basis points versus the prior year from 28% to 26%. Volume declines related to the 25% year-on-year decline in our sales reduced our gross margin by 400 basis points. We also continued to reduce our inventory levels in the quarter. The impact of lower production levels to achieve the inventory reductions reduced gross margins by an additional 200 basis points. Our cost reduction actions were able to partially offset these negative effects of both volume and production and added 400 basis points to our gross margin.", "Comparing our gross margin to last quarter, it increased from 23% to 26%. Higher volumes in the Electronic Components segment were partially offset by the expected volume declines in lower margin sales mix and the Undersea Telecom segment. As a result the net volume effect was 100 basis points of improvement, while we did reduce inventories in the quarter, the negative effect on the P&L was positive versus last quarter by 100 basis points. And finally, cost reduction added a 100 basis point sequentially to our gross margin.", "Looking at the middle of the slide, operating expenses which include both RD&E and SG&A were down $82 million year-over-year or about 15%. Excluding the effects of currency translation, we reduced our operating expenses by approximately $70 million to a combination of headcount reductions and spending controls.", "Operating expenses were up 2% versus the third quarter driven primarily by the sequential increase in sales. As sales continue to increase there will be a modest increase in our operating expenses.", "And finally as Tom mentioned, our structural cost actions of $300 million to achieve 12% adjusted operating income on a $12 billion of sales on track.", "Now turn to slide 9 and let me discuss items on the P&L below the operating line. Net interest expense was $36 million versus $39 million in the prior year. As I mentioned earlier included in interest expense was $3 million of expense related to the early retirement of debt, excluding this expense net interest expense would have been $33 million down $6 million versus the prior year as a result of lower debt levels.", "Other expense was $55 million which included two adjusting items. The first is an $86 million expense primarily related to the settlement of a pre-separation tax liability. And the second is the $22 million gain on the early retirement that I discussed earlier. When you exclude these items, adjusted other income was $9 million. And for quarter one I expect this will be approximately $11 million of income.", "The GAAP effective tax rate was 1% in the quarter and the tax rate on adjusted income was 28%, which was slightly higher than we guided. Going into next year, we expect the tax rate on adjusted income of approximately 28%, reflecting the continued progress in separation on leveraging our structure. The GAAP rate was impacted by various tax items including the settlement of a pre-separation tax liability.", "This settlement affected both the GAAP other income and the income tax expense lines. This settlement is not a full settlement of our pre-separation tax liabilities, a rather settlement on one matter. This settlement has not changed our view on the eventual size of our portion of the shared tax liabilities. As we previously communicated, as individual items get settled under the tax sharing agreement, it will create volatility both positive and negative on our income statement.", "Now let me turn to free cash flow, which starts on slide 10. Our free cash flow in quarter four was $608 million, up from $437 million in the prior year quarter. Lower income levels were more than offset by the reductions in working capital and capital spending. ", "Our day sales outstanding of 66 days were essentially flat both versus the prior and sequential. Our inventory days on hand, which excludes construction in progress, were down 13 days year-over-year and eight days sequentially to 59 days.", "As volumes begin to return, we do expect inventory days to move back into the 60s which is a substantial improvement over the 72 days where we ended 2008. We spent $58 million on capital on quarter four, which is down from prior year levels of $165 million. ", "For the full year, our capital expenditures were approximately 3% of sales as our capital spending focused on tooling for new programs. In fiscal 2010, we expect capital spending to return to the low-end of our historical spending level of 4% to 5% of sales.", "Cash restructuring in the quarter, was $60 million. And full year cash restructuring spending was $260 million. For fiscal 2010, we expect cash restructuring spending of approximately $300 million. For the full year fiscal 2009, our free cash flow was $1.2 billion inclusive of the restructuring spending I just mentioned. This compares to $1.3 billion in 2008, which included $76 million of restructuring spending.", "Our 2009 performance demonstrates the strong cash generation of our business model, and we are very pleased with how our team performed this year. As we look to the future we continue to expect that our free cash flow will approximate net income in a normal growth environment. Our adjusted cash tax rate should remain around 20% for the foreseeable future in the favorable difference versus the expected adjusted effective tax rate of 28% should offset the working capital increases as volume was returned.", "Let me now cover debt and liquidity which is on slide 11. We began the quarter with about $1.3 billion of cash and ended the quarter with $1.5 billion. Uses of cash during the quarter included debt reductions from the tender of $141 million, dividends of $73 million. ", "Voluntary pension contributions of $61 million and cash payments related to pre-separation litigation matters of $52 million. The Litigation payment was related to a P&L charge we took earlier in the year and the voluntary pension contribution we made of $61 million was an addition to our normal contributions of $84 million that made during 2009.", "The $61 million that we made was the level of contribution that made economic sense in light of the asset declines we saw in 2009 in some of our plans. For fiscal 2010, we expect our contribution will be at under normal level, which is below $100 million as our plans remain well funded. While the pension funded status declines will not significantly affect our pension contributions for 2010, it will impact our pension expense. We estimate that our pension expense will go up by about 50 million in 2010 and we'll be about $160 million for the full year. And at quarter end, our debt balance was $2.4 billion down from $3.2 billion last year. Our balance sheet is solid and in the short-term we will continue to maintain a higher level of cash to preserve flexibility. ", "And finally, we maintained our quarterly dividend to $0.16 per share and our shareholders have already approved payments for the first two quarters of fiscal 2010 at $0.16 per share.", "Now let me hand the call back over to Tom.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks Terrence. We'll now go to slide 12, up just quickly sum up our outlook for our first quarter of fiscal '10 our sales will be in the range of 2.7 billion to 2.8 billion. Organically this is flat sales, compared to Q4 with continued strength in the Electronic Components segment which we expect to be up 3% to 5% sequentially being offset by 25% sequential decline in Undersea.", "We expect adjusted operating income to be in the 250 million to 280 million range, which is an increase of 13% to 27% sequentially. The continued improvement of sequential profitability is primarily due to the improved leverage on the volume increases in the Electronic Components segment again partially offset by the sales decline in Undersea. And this should result in gross margins in the 27% to 28% range which is up from 26% in Q4.", "Our adjusted earnings per share, from continuing operations are expected to be $0.35 to $0.39 sequential increase of 17% to 30%. So just wrapping it up, tough economic year, we feel a year of good operating performance and also a year where we strengthen the company's strategic position. Don't want to have to go through another '09 again, but I think again thank our team for really doing a great job pulling together and getting through it.", "So, with that let's open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). And the first question comes from the line of Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Hi, good morning Tom and Terrence. Congratulations on the quarter. First question I have just is regards to just kind of ongoing incremental benefit from both restructuring as well as the decline in inventory reductions. With the inventory reductions maybe add another 100 basis points to the operating margin sequentially, and then on the restructuring versus the end of fiscal '09 how much on a dollar basis is left in terms of benefits in 2010 given large amount of cash cost to come.", "Tom Lynch", "", "Thanks Shawn. Let me answer part of that, and then I'll turn it over to Terrence. Our gross margin up to 26% Q4, clearly that was largely benefited from the cost actions and the restructuring and then the outlook for Q1 getting to 28%, continued benefit from the cost actions we are also seeing our production come inline with our sale for the first time in quite a while, so then we are sort of in a balanced environment. As far as the restructuring program goes look at in two ways from a starting the program and going through it will probably almost 70% through, paying for the program we are about half way through if you think of this year our charges from '09 to '010 will actually go down but our cash will actually cash out will actually increase as we get through a large part of the program. Terrence you want to elaborate on that?", "Terrence Curtin", "", "Yeah I mean when you look at to Toms first part of the answer on the margin Shawn, when you go sequentially what we really had going on here, was about half of the benefits further inventory we assume production will be balanced with volume in quarter one so that's about half of the improvement in the operating margin. And then the other half is cost action, when we go sequentially from quarter four to quarter one there is about $15 million of saving that you can basically annualize to $60 million from an exit rate coming out of quarter four from a restructuring perspective.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Okay and then beyond the first quarter is there anything above that $60 million annualized that we shouldn't model?", "Terrence Curtin", "Add is what you should include in right now things that are happening anything new we start well could come later in the year and trail into '11.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Okay and then second just on follow-up, usage of cash flow, I know there has been some talk on prior calls about acquisition opportunity, may Tom you could speak to what you're seeing in the market place in terms of acquisition opportunity and kind of where you're trying to pinpoint some bolt on acquisitions?", "Tom Lynch", "Well, obviously the last couple of years we have been in the divestiture mode to get the company a lot more focused and tied around our connectivity business. We have developed a pretty robust acquisition pipeline, I would say. So we think in certain markets, particular areas like energy, aerospace and defense, medical, there is opportunity there. I'd say the markets are starting to come back to life a little bit there. ", "In terms of our cash, we need about $500 million to run the company. We'd like to keep a couple of hundred million [sure terms] profit this as well. If we need to reduce the debt further right now, we don't need to do that, but we're carrying about $800 million, I'd call it strategic flexibility which gives us the opportunity to look it up acquisitions as the right one through there and if not, we talk to the board every quarter about how much should we hold and how much should we return. So, our thinking hasn't really changed.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin with Thomas Weisel Partners. Please go ahead. ", "Matt Sheerin - Thomas Weisel Partners", "I just wanted to just ask about what you're seeing in terms of the demand picture. Obviously the quarter was better than seasonal, your guidance on the electronic side looks better than seasonal. And I know its difficult for every one to figure out the difference between to demand and restocking, but do you have a sense that this whole restocking phase of the recovery cycle here is behind us or is there still a little bit of that left?", "Terrence Curtin", "", "I think there is still a little bit of it left, but certainly that has been closed quite a bit in Q3 but especially in Q4. So, just based on our order rate and the [extabate] by our customers of us, I think that a lot of our customers are still feeling that their inventory levels are too low. I think as you go around the world, emerging markets, that were stimulus, but there is also real demand there and I think its just a little more uncertain, although it feels better in the US and Europe.", "Matt Sheerin - Thomas Weisel Partners", "And I know obviously visibility is still pretty tough, but would you expect given that the restocking phase is ending here and we don't really know what demand is going to look like that? You could return to more seasonal levels in the March quarter or is too early to tell what March is going to look like?", "Terrence Curtin", "I think it Matt, is still a little too early to tell. Like I said, we feel better than we did three and six months ago, but we also know the way where these things tend to go. Now that people are coming back, everybody is trying to protect little bit against the upside and we're making sure, we don't over react to that.", "Matt Sheerin - Thomas Weisel Partners", "And just lastly, just in terms of your capacity and ability to meet customer orders. I know you've been hearing across the supply chain of some lead time stretching, some distributors scrambling for parts. Are you seeing that in any of your business?", "Terrence Curtin", "Yeah, we are scrambling a little bit too. Its really more material related. Its hard as things went down in the component segment and a lot of companies, everybody pushed inventory out and it just takes a little bit longer to get that back. But the good news is, sequentially in Electronic Components, we're in 14%-15% sequential growth the last two quarters. So, we're coming up pretty fast, but clearly, in some cases not as fast as our customers want us to. But we don't have any fundamental capacity issues bricks and motor or people and the way reflecting on the people side is being careful using overtime things like that, slowly adding folks back into the mix until we feel a little more solid, but its more chasing material. ", "Matt Sheerin - Thomas Weisel Partners", "", "But you're not concerned with any double ordering that possibly happens?", "Terrence Curtin", "We're watching it carefully. I would say we're really watching that carefully. It's hard to discern that at times, I suspect there is a little bit of that going on, but we reflected that in our Q1 outlook. ", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Amitabh Passi with UBS please go ahead.", "Amitabh Passi - UBS", "", "My first question has to do with, if I look at your guidance it looks like you are now approaching sort of $11 billion on an annualized run rate for revenues and about 10% operating margins. And just to get to your 12 at 12 model, it still looks like the implied incremental operating margins are north of 30%. If I back up the restructuring benefits, I don't know $60, $70 million. Looks like you're still looking at incremental margins of sort of mid 20s. Is that the right way to think about your model on a more normalized basis once we return to normalized revenues and get a lot of the restructuring benefits behind?", "Terrence Curtin", "", "I think you're looking at it right on Amitabh. The only thing I would say is we are getting some benefit of currency translation right now. That is creating, as Tom about; we do guidance for the quarter again about 500 basis points of growth Q4 to Q1. That's the only weird part of the calculation right now, because you don't really get real flow through on that. You just get translation. But the way you are thinking about the model is correct and like we talked about in the call, before the 12 at 12, where we're fully lined up for where we are exiting the year.", "Amitabh Passi - UBS", "And then my second question had to do with your Undersea Telecom. Let us assume that business at some point transferred it down to sort of $500 million annual run rate. Can you still do double digit operating margins in that segment?", "Terrence Curtin", "Yes. It would be on the top as we talked about before, when you look at that, it would probably be in the 10% to 11% with how we built the business and structured the business. So, from that view point, we can definitely be in double digits at the low end of that $500 million level.", "Amitabh Passi - UBS", "And then just my final question, when you talk of your 12-12 model, even if I adjust your peak revenues which are approaching or I guess you did about $14.4 billion and if I adjust for Undersea Telecom instead of assuming your segment north of $1 billion, let's assume its $500 million. It still implies that your revenues will be down about probably 14% - 15% from where you were at the peak levels, whereas if I look at some of your peers by 2011, they will sort of be back to their peak levels of 2007-2008. Would love to get your comments in terms of why you think there is still this large discrepancy between actually what's implied the consensus estimate, your target model versus your peers and if there's a chance that your 12-12 could prove conservative?", "Tom Lynch", "", "I guess I can't comment on my peers. If you just look at automotive as an example though, in 2008 there were 72 million cars produced, 2010, 60 million and most of the folks who do the forecasting, they don't think you'd get back to $72 million until probably 2013. So, I don't think most people are viewing that absolute business levels are going to be back by 2011 to where they were in 2008. I haven't heard anybody say that. I think the most important thing though is we are positioned to manage well I think whatever the volume levels are. We do store excess capacity, but yet we still have plenty of capacity to grow past where we were in 2008 as you said in the [14/3]. And if you look at the margin leverage, we are close to 150, 200 basis points better then where we were as a result of the actions we've taken.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Jim Suva - Citi", "On your outlook for the next quarter, is that pretty much based upon a annual automotive production unit of $60 million or is it still kind of on the increasing part occur for that?", "Terrence Curtin", "", "If you look at quarter one, Jim, quarter one auto production in the $60 million Tom talked about is about $16 million units. So, if you look at it, there is probably about a million more units in Q1 than just $60 million divided by 4 which would be 15. So, there is still a little bit of production bump here in quarter one to [about up] 6% from quarter four. So, there is a little bump there, but it is $60 million, it's not too much.", "Jim Suva - Citi", "And to reach your 12-12 goal, do you think you can get there at $60 million or could you actually get there with a little bit less than global auto units at $60 million?", "Terrence Curtin", "We would need more than $60 million, Jim.", "Jim Suva - Citi", "And what would that level be for more than $60 million?", "Terrence Curtin", "It would be closer to $63, $64 million.", "Jim Suva - Citi", "Okay, great. And then just a quick\u2026", "Terrence Curtin", "(Inaudible) more growth.", "Jim Suva - Citi", "Quick clarification on the tax rate, I though I heard 28%, but then I thought I heard 20%. Which ones of those should we use for going forward?", "Terrence Curtin", "20% Jim is the cash tax, right? And the 28% is the adjusted tax rate. As you know, when we separated, our tax rate was in the mid 30s and we continue to work on planning and I know the tax rate has been very volatile this year just due to our earnings that have been volatile this year, but 28% in the environment we see right not is what you should use for 2010. ", "Jim Suva - Citi", "And my last question, you've worked on inventory pretty aggressively in the past three or four quarters. Are you at a point now where we should start to see inventory increase or stabilize or what's your inventory outlook?", "Terrence Curtin", "You should expect to see inventory increase a little bit and our days are going to increase a little as well. So absolute dollars will go up because revenues are going up a little bit, but we need to put a little more into the channel and into our production here. ", "Operator", "", "Next we'll go to the line Craig Hettenbach with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs", "In the automotive space, can you talk about things you are doing from a competitive stand point through this downturn? Whether it's a design? If I think about automotive and the pressures it's been, there is companies are deemphasizing that market. So, just really looking for ways that you would be able to capitalize on that and particular may be potential resources you are putting towards that as that market ultimately will recover. ", "Tom Lynch", "", "Well automotive is critical to us. As you know, we have a very strong position there and it's taken a long time to build up that position because of the demands of the customers and appropriately so. We protected engineering in that organization despite the significant downturn. At one point, our business was down 55% in revenue globally just three quarters ago and we are very, very focused as ever from an engineering sales and marketing point of view. We haven't changed our attitude and I think we actually from a strategic point of view, strengthen our position through the last year in terms of some key platform wins and definitely evolving our alternative power and connectivity system in all parts of the world. And so, I liked our position, we've always been strong there and I actually feel we are a little stronger than we were a year-ago.", "And from a cost structure point of view, that's where a lot of this heavy lifting on the restructuring had been which is to reduce our excess capacity. Our automotive team has a very good track record of productivity improvement, but we weren't taking the unnecessary fixed capacity offline (inaudible) and we've made a lot of progress on that in the last 18 months. So, I think, strengthen our position to grow, strengthen the portfolio of products and reduce our fixed cost structures. And the profitability, the automotive business has come back quickly. It's not the way it was two years ago and the business is lot higher, but the team got it back on track much faster than one might have expected with that kind of downturn.", "Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs", "And if I could follow up, you mentioned orders ex-Undersea Telecom up 12%. Can you just give some color about linearity through the quarter and then in the current quarter on the order rate level and then also, just what you're seeing in the pricing environment as we make away to the trough of downturn here?", "Tom Lynch", "That means the pricing is actually pretty strict. Well, let me answer that. The pricing has not changed. I mean certainly, the consumer electronics markets are always been the most aggressive but our price erosion is still sub 2% and really has not moved and so that hasn't changed. Craig on your order question, really what we saw from an order prospective and our quarter four results show that, as we exited quarter three, orders were stabilizing as we talked on our last call. We saw a little bit of a step up in September and that order level has continued into October. So, October order trends are very consistent with September and slightly up from where we were in the July and August earlier in the quarter. So, from that viewpoint Tom talked about the consistency of orders and certainly that consistency has been in our component segment as well as the networks and specialty product segments.", "Operator", "And next we will go to the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America", "", "Can you perhaps talk a little more about the automotive business by region? Specifically, is the content for car beginning to recover somewhat and given that the last majority of growth that you're projecting in fiscal '10 is coming from Asia? How worried are you about a negative mix shift from a content for auto perspective?", "Tom Lynch", "", "I guess a couple of things. I think if you, content per car, you really have to look at it at a granular level. From what I mean by that is, I don't think in any car, any category of vehicle, content is not going down. It's going up everywhere. Even the small cars are adding more features like analog breaks, in some parts of the world where that hasn't been prominent for electronic stability control, certainly entertainment, more airbag. We see that trend everywhere. Even in areas of the emerging markets. ", "And as I mentioned, I was just in India and talking with a couple of our big automotive customers there. They've actually been surprised a little bit with the resiliency of the mid sized cars and folks are still demanding more features and no question I think you're going to see probably a little bit of a higher growth rate in smaller cars because the emerging market is where the higher growth rates are. ", "But on a vehicle basis, look for content to continue to grow. Slight impact on the averaging of mix, so the average content per vehicle but not significant couple of dollars per vehicle may be in the grand scheme of things. That's kind of $100 million, $120 million revenue. So don't see anything really negative there. The real question is, what's the growth rate going to be in the US and Europe. I mean I think its back on track in Asia and the fundamentals are pretty straight forward there and as we are all wrestling with in the west, what is the real state of these economies. ", "Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America", "And on the raw material side, both with sort of gold and copper so pretty high elevated levels, can you update us on you current hedge levels for those rise?", "Tom Lynch", "Yeah Wamsi, as you know, as we went through this, we were overly hedged and we actually finished burning up all our positions here in the fourth quarter related to copper. So, you actually look at 2009, our net copper cost was around $2.70, $2.80 a pound and right now with where we are fixed through basically the first six months 2010, we are at a similar level. So, copper is really a non-factor right now, with where it's at in our fixed positions. When you look at gold, gold certainly has a little bit of a head win, not major. We are hedged out for the first six months around $900 to $1000 an ounce. So we had a little bit of benefit versus market for year-on-year to slight headwind, but not much. So, right now raw materials are included at the rates I just talked about when we look out and it's not a big positive or negative.", "Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America", "Specifically a guidance that anticipated a charge of 75 million on the quarter and you guys recognized 45 million from a restructuring charge standpoint. And your guidance is now calling for 60 million charge in fiscal 1Q which is actually up sequentially; can you talk about what's driving those dynamics please?", "Terrence Curtin", "Its just timing [only]. Some of these charges that we are taking or relate to actions that we have already have initiated as well as may be an action we wanted to do here in quarter four that will leak into quarter one. So it's just timing between the quarters.", "Operator", "Next we will go to the line of William Stein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "William Stein - Credit Suisse", "Just a little bit more on the restructuring I think your comments earlier suggested that we get the last of the benefits in the December quarter and I think you said [million] sequentially or 60 million annualized. I had thought that these were going to extent out and continue to benefit the P&L above all the other benefits from higher revenue and better [growth in] cost from inventories, stabilizing but how we are going to get that into March. Is that changed now or is it, have the benefits, more the benefits been realized or more than coming into December from March.", "Terrence Curtin", "We benefited quicker than we expected from a cost action prospect, so we have been able to complete things from that view point we do get some things done quicker. Some of the closures we did in the automotive area Tom talked about we completed earlier than we expected from our prior guidance when we talked a few quarters ago.", "William Stein - Credit Suisse", "And then also can you update us on your efforts in distribution I think historically the company has been perhaps over franchised, I think you have been taking some actions in that regard, if you can talk about that will be helpful?", "Terrence Curtin", "As you know that's been a key focus for us over the past year plus to build more strategic relationships under strategic channel than we have in the past that's moving along nicely. We are still in the first phase of doing that, so I expect it will continue to happen over the next three to six months, but it's well underway and that we are feeling very excited about where this is probably is going to help us.", "William Stein - Credit Suisse", "Wondering also if you can perhaps quantify a bit about what this scrambling for deliveries you discussed earlier would have been in the quarter in terms of, perhaps what revenue could have been if you could deliver to your customers demand then also whether that meaningfully affecting lead times and ASPs for the company overall?", "Terrence Curtin", "I would say if we were at our normal sort of delivery rate, we would have had 20 million to 30 million more of revenue in Q4. But, that's a big if because as you know when things go down that sort, and then come back, it just takes time to climb the pump. And we are working hard to do it because at the end of the day the most important thing is to keep the customers happy and so I think we are making progress, but we are still not caught up as much as we'd like to be.", "William Stein - Credit Suisse", "And on the lead times in ASPs, I would assume lead times are certainly extending themselves your bookings would suggest, trade bookings were up a lot more than what your guiding revenues to go up and so I assume that meets backlog extending lead times extending is that right and then also any is it supporting ASPs here is there any talk of raising prices in this environment?", "Terrence Curtin", "There is no kind of across the board talk we are always evaluating where our pricing is but pricing really more moves in conjunction when it does with commodity cost increases and as you know they are not that easy to get either, so no there is no sort of across the board pricing because of the supply demand and balance. In terms of the lead times I would say if you wanted to average it we probably a week to two weeks outside on average, and a lot of areas we are okay in some areas we are worse than that, but on an average we are probably a week 10 days I would say longer than normal.", "Operator", "", "Okay thank you and next we will go to the line of Steven Fox with CLSA please go ahead.", "Steven Fox - CLSA", "", "Thanks good morning just two quick questions one just trying to understand the plans for the footprint going forward and may be this is a better question for the analyst meeting but just getting a sense from where you stand versus potentially other restructurings down the road and or just naturally weaning some plans out. And then secondly it hasn't been much conversation around just sort of selling into corporate equipment the data comp market it sounds like you are fairly conservative on those markets at least to the spring, can you just talk about what you are seeing specifically may be in the box of servers versus may be outside the box with cables etcetera.", "Tom Lynch", "", "Let me talk the data comp I think the market is starting to come back I would say historically in the box we haven't been that strong, we put up higher priority on that strategic as a strategic focus area about three years ago. And the product line that we started to introduce about six to nine months ago a range of high speed products. ", "I think a very, very competitive probably more so than we have ever been and in terms of strategic position I think we are getting better but we are still feeling the effect of not being a major player there I means its an important player, but not one of the top couple, and so we made progress but we are still not where we want to be there I think from the cable side that's the strong (inaudible) for us. On our enterprise business we have had a two or three really good years, I mean that business has been [off] a little bit but in the [server] areas its still pretty strong, so you know we connect in the enterprise we are in the network, so we have a pretty robust position there which I think has actually run stronger over the last couple of years.", "Steven Fox - CLSA", "And Tom how do you feel about the market right now in that area? If you can just go back over that a little bit more?", "Tom Lynch", "Enterprise right now is still, its flat its been down, its flattened out in the last couple of months that's one of those that I mentioned that I don't think we are going to see an upturn from the current levels for another quarter or so. And that the outside the box fees I think its coming back a little bit faster in the inside the box fees which would cause data comp or communications infrastructure, but we expect to see that the inside box for us to be up sequentially next quarter.", "Terrence Curtin", "And then Steve on your restructuring of footprint comment couple of things I mean you said it could very well, early in December when we have our investor day we will get into it more detail, where we are right now though is 97 facilities. We have that are in process that will pay for the bulk of 2010 to complete and that gets us in the low 90s I guess it has been in the high 80s or low 90s when we are done. Completing most of it here in '10, maybe a little trickle into '11, but like we already said this was a three year program. We have accelerated it, the increase that so from that view point will give you a more full update in early December but despite currently in process.", "John Roselli", "", "We'll still take few more questions please.", "Operator", "Next we will go to the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks. Tom, you were talking about, I think auto production being partially up about 10% in 2010, and it's going to be fairly Asia centric. Could you maybe help us provide or maybe provide a frame book in what you think your auto business would do if production is up 10% next year and its Asia centric?", "Tom Lynch", "", "Generally I would say, with good track to that maybe a little higher than that. We are strong in Asia. Europe our largest market share is in Europe, our second largest market share is in Asia and that share has been increasing over the last several years. So, again if you would take that five million units, it probably splits about three million in Asia; 1 million Europe, 1 million US. So, it's not all Asia, but clearly the larger proportion of the increase is Asia.", "Terrence Curtin", "I think the key thing to your question Amit is we average around $60 a content per vehicle, certainly we may, we get hit to Tom's point a couple of bucks due to mix, but then you have to take that against the 60 million vehicles if that comes true. So, I think that's the way to frame it properly as you are modeling.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Fair enough. And then can you just talk about if there any possibility, you start the new fiscal year about revisiting the share buy back option and if you don't go about [that] could you talk about what the bigger priorities are for the cash you generate going forward?", "Tom Lynch", "", "We still have about $600 million open on the share buyback authorization from the board that we carried over and of course we suspended that due to circumstances. We really want to get another month under our belt, two good solid quarters of sequential improvement and demand picking up in our big Electronic Component segment. Kind of the proof will be in putting under recovery in the balance of this quarter and early next quarter which we are optimistic about, but think its still too early to go back into the program. ", "And as I said its something we it's a very important topic with our board. Like you can tell from our first year, we don't sit on the cash, so we are not going to just sit on it, but I do think we are better positioned and we are more ready than we were a year ago and have been more focused on how do we strengthen the company strategically through inorganic moves.", "The first 18 months were very focused on the divestiture side the last six to nine months have been much more focused on the pipeline in the areas that I mentioned like energy and medical and aerospace besides its not exclusively those but certainly those are and our enterprise business those are important markets where we have nice good solid market position and we would like to strengthen our position. ", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Got it and then just finally I think you talked about 500 basis points of benefit on the revenue line from FX sequentially is there any impact on the EPS line?", "Terrence Curtin", "", "Its very minor its because that how it falls through it would be less than a penny.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Fair enough thanks a lot guys and congratulations on the quarter.", "Operator", "The last question will come from Brian White with Ticonderoga.", "Brian White - Ticonderoga", "Just on the material side you are scrambling to get materials what specifically is difficult to procure?", "Tom Lynch", "Its across as you know we start with base materials that come through whether its metals, resins and anything. So anytime in those base metals the lead time in those could be up to a month so that's pretty much across the board Brian.", "Brian White - Ticonderoga", "Okay. Then when we think about the December quarter you have a great outlook in the auto market I think typically its somewhat seasonal your peers had a great September quarter just like you did, but then they are going to succumb to seasonality in the December quarter, why do you think you are out performing in the December quarter versus your peers?", "Tom Lynch", "I mean I can only, I won't say it relative to peers just; what we are seeing is the backlog is pretty robust in the automotive business right now. And we are (inaudible) into it so there is still we pushed a little bit last of the inventory rebuilt and auto is almost 30% of our business that went down three quarters ago it was fairly tough it went down so much harder than any other market almost twice as far, twice as big a fall as any of our other market so I think we are just seeing the return to a little more normal level albeit to a level where we were in 2008.", "Terrence Curtin", "Yeah and Brian I would just speak up along seasonality right now certainly we have over time a pretty straight forward season of pattern in our businesses and as we are coming out of this I would caution new in seasonality until we get sort of stabilization like Tom talked about as we looked to next couple of quarters.", "Brian White - Ticonderoga", "Okay and when we think about the China market within Asia do you feel like you are the number one player in the connector market within China.", "Operator", "Okay. And no further questions. Please go ahead.", "John Roselli", "Okay, well thanks everyone for joining us this morning. The IR team will be around all day for any follow-up questions you may have, and everyone have a good day.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be made available for replay after 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time today until November 11th, 2009 at midnight.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we'll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, today\u2019s call will be recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your Vice President of Investor Relations Mr. John Roselli. Please go ahead sir.", "John Roselli", "Thanks Steve. Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Tyco Electronics first quarter results for fiscal year 2010 and our outlook for the second quarter. With me today is our Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch and our Chief Financial Officer, Terrence Curtin. ", "During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask you to look at today\u2019s press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary statements that we\u2019ve included there. In addition we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning and we ask you to read through the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that addressed the use of these items. The press release and related tables along with the slide presentation can be found on the investor relations portion of our website at tycoelectronics.com. Now let me turn the call over to Tom for some opening comments.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks John and good morning everyone. And if we can start with slide 3. I'll briefly talk about the first quarter and what we're seeing in our markets right now. And then I'll turn it over to Terrence and he'll go through our Q1 results in more detail. ", "Our first quarter was a very good start to our fiscal year and it was actually our third quarter in a row of solid sales and profit improvement. Our sales and earnings significantly exceed our guidance in yet another quarter of strong free cash flow. ", "On the sales front, we grew 7% sequentially to $2.9 billion and our largest segment Electronic Components we grew 17%, it was 14% organic growth. On a very positive note, within the Electronics Component segment consumer and industrial markets grew at double digit rate sequentially resulting from a combination of improved end demand in most of these markets as well as continued inventory replenishment in the supply chain. ", "Our Networks and Specialty Products businesses did remain somewhat sluggish in the quarter and we expected this that they are showing some signs of stabilizing demand and our Undersea business declined 25% sequentially as we expected.", "The sales growth in the quarter coupled with our aggressive cost reduction efforts and footprint actions resulted in our gross margin improving to 29% and this improved our adjusted operating margin to 11.5%. This compares to 8.2% in the prior quarter and just as a point of reference in our fiscal year '08 when our sales rate was about $14 billion, our average gross margin then was 29%. ", "So, as you know, a big focus area for us over the last couple of years has been to improve the operating leverage in the company and I\u2019m really pleased with the operating leverage that we're seeing as a result of streamlining the footprint, improving productivity and cleaning up the portfolio.", "The net effect was this enabled our Electronics Components segment to return to double digit margins in the quarter after generating operating losses just two quarters ago and I will say our management teams in those business has navigated through tough time [kept] around the future and got us back in solid profitability pretty quickly. ", "As you know and as we've talked about over the last year, our primary focus coming out of this downturn was to achieve a 12% operating margin at $12 billion annual sales level without sacrificing our strategic opportunity. Our team has done an outstanding job executing on this objective in the last year and we're right on track to achieve the [12 to 12] goal.", "And then finally with respect to cash we generated $256 million of pre cash flow in the quarter which is really outstanding performance and Terrance will elaborate on later in the call. Typically\u00a0Q1 is a low cash flow quarter for us. Because getting out of the gate like this, was another good kind of our strong execution. ", "Let me now talk a little bit about what we're seeing in the market. Our total company orders excluding Undersea grew 15% and our book-to-bill ratio was 1.09. This growth was led by our Electronic Components segment and its broad based across the consumer industrial markets we serve. We also experienced growth in our Specialty Products segment reflecting improvement in our aerospace and defense and touch businesses. ", "Orders in our Network segment were up 1% sequentially, showing a little sign of improvement late in the quarter. Our Networks businesses due continue to be impacted by lower capital spending by our customers. These businesses turned down later than our components businesses, and are recovering in the same cycle at least that's the way we see it right now. ", "Finally, in our Undersea business, project activity remained robust although we did not book any significant projects in the quarter. However, we did have a previously booked project move forward and we now expect full year sales in the $7 million to $8 million range up from our prior view of $600 to $700 million. ", "So based on everything we see today, we expect sales in Q2 to be flat to slightly higher than Q1. We do expect end demand to continue to improve in our components businesses, but this will be somewhat offset by the end of the inventory replenishment portion of this cycle. We are optimistic that the improvement we're seeing in our industrial infrastructure markets excluding Undersea is going to lead the stronger sales in these markets in the second half. ", "Let me shift gears here a little bit. As I mentioned earlier preserving our strategic opportunities and accelerating innovation in the company were very high priorities for us have been since we separated and remained high priorities even when we were going through the very difficult last year due to the economic problems around the globe, and so while obviously there was a tremendous amount of focus on taking cost out. I'm just as proud of our team, we are keeping our focus on the future and on the strategic opportunities we have.", "I just wanted to highlight a few, I'll start with automotive as you know our automotive business was hit the hardest in the downturn our team managed through that back to very solid profitability again, but even more importantly in the first quarter in Europe which is our largest automotive segment, we had our highest design win in total ever this quarter. ", "So, that team kept focused on the customer and I think the customers really appreciated having a strong supply of that not only had the financial ware withal to get through that difficult time but continued investing. Another very bright spot in our automotive business is in China where we've got the $300 million plus business, we expect to grow in excess of 15% to 20% this year, we do have market leaderships positioned across that market with both the multinational OEMs who were there as well as the local Chinese OEMs, so we still were very well positioned in that market in the short-term and for the long haul. ", "In our aerospace and defense business, we continued to win new designs of selling an airbus. Its really exciting here as we are designing solutions for these customers, that go well beyond our traditional connector and wire and cable competencies we worked with these customers early in the architecture and they see that we have value to add there our content as we mentioned in the investor meeting in December our content on this next generation aircraft will be as much as 5 to 7 times higher than the current platforms. So I guess like everybody else we are very anxious for those to start rolling out later this year.", "In another one of our important segments, data communications equipment, I would say it's probably fair to say that historically we have not been viewed as the technology leader in this segment. ", "This has been a very, very high focus area for us the last two or three years naturally given the proliferation of data and broadband and the infrastructure they have to go in place to enable that and we made a lot of progress with the introduction of our new high-speed (inaudible) product families in the last 12 months and have increased our design in win rates, with mostly server and storage equipment providers. You don't see it in our sales today but these wins definitely form the basis of what we expect to be higher than market growth in future years.", "I think it is another example of the team being able to focus on the long term, while also getting through the short time. And then lastly in our touch business, as we announced recently we acquired a company called Sensitive Object an early stage software company with touch enabling technologies, principally give for the consumer markets such as PCs, mobile devices and consumer electronics. And this team and the technology and the capability they bring are a really nice compliment to our existing $350 million touch systems business which is primarily focused on commercial and industrial markets. ", "But the acquisition of SO significantly strengthens our overall touch technology portfolio and as we all know this is a market that is growing tremendously almost explosively I would say. If we do think of this as an R&D investment we expect fresh revenue in the 2011, 2012 timeframe.", "Well these are just a few highlights of some significant progress, but again thanks to the team for managing us through difficult times and coming out in good shape on the other side. ", "So now let me turn it over to Terrence. ", "Terrence Curtin", "", "Thanks, Tom and good morning everyone. Let me start by reviewing our sales performance by the segments and by market, then I'll review earnings and cash flow. If you turn to slide 4, this slide shows our overall revenue performance by segment both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Total company sales were $2.9 billion and this was up 7% in the quarter versus the prior year sales of $2.7 billion.", "Sequentially, sales were also up 7% as a result of the strong growth in the electronic components segment of 17%, which was partially offset by declines in the other three segments. In our businesses serving the consumer markets, which is about half of our business and is mostly concentrated in our component segment.", "Sales increased 18% sequentially driven by improved demand and inventory restocking. The industrial and infrastructure markets continued the trend from last quarter and were essentially flat on a sequential basis. We did start to see signs of stabilization and signs of improvement in our order rates and the industrial and infrastructure markets excluding our undersea telecom segment.", "Now let me get into more detail and cover segment performance by the market. Unless otherwise indicated all changes that are mentioned are on an organic basis, so let's turn to slide 5. And before I start getting into the detail I want to remind everyone that beginning this quarter we reclassified sales to certain end markets and our components segment we recreated new industry groupings and we now allocate distributor sales to end markets where possible. We did file an 8-K on December 8 that provided quarterly information for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 and these new market groupings. So, now starting with the left side of slide 5, sales in our electronic components segment increased 12% versus the prior year to $1.9 billion.", "Strength in the consumer related markets were partially offset by declines in the industrial markets. Sequentially sales increased 14% with broad based increases across all end markets. So getting in the details in the markets, in the automotive market, our sales versus the prior year increased 30% and sequentially sales were up 17%. We estimate global automotive production group approximately 8% sequentially and this growth in production coupled with the continued restocking of the supply chain, drove double digit sales increases in all regions with particular strength in North America and in Asia.", "We do expect production to decline sequentially from quarter one into quarter two, but we expect our sales will be flat to slightly up due to further restocking and this is supported by our current backlog.", "In the DataComm market, which includes sales for the communications equipment server and storage markets, our sales decline 14% year-over-year, however sales were up 13% sequentially, and this increase was driven by increased spending on wireless and broadband infrastructure, as well as data storage equipment.", "Turning to the industrial equipment market, sales were down 8% versus the prior year, but up 13% sequentially. Restocking by distributors and improved end demand drove the sequential increase. Order rates continued to improve the trends that we already discussed in the industrial area and during the first quarter we expect revenues to be slightly up in quarter two.", "In the appliance market, sales were up 15% versus the prior year and up 11% sequentially with sales increases in all regions. However our sales in emerging markets were especially strong and as you know this is where we have a very strong position.", "In the computer market our sales declined 5% versus the prior year, however on a sequential basis sales we are up 5% in line with end unit shipment data.", "And finally in the consumer device markets which include sales to the mobile phone and consumer electronic markets, our sales were up 8% versus the prior year and up 2% sequentially driven by end market demand. We continue to strengthen our position in the mobile phone market with program wins in both our connector and antenna product offerings.", "Let me turn to our Network Solution segment now which is on the right side of the slide, sales declined 15% versus the prior year and 6% sequentially driven by continued capital spending reductions by our customers. Sales to the Energy market were down 13% versus the prior year and down 4% sequentially driven by lower spending as well as inventory reductions that are utility customers. In the Enterprise Networks market our sales declined 6% versus the prior year and 4% sequentially reflecting continued weak commercial construction markets.", "And our sales to the service provider market declined 25% versus the prior year and 8% sequentially, due to the trend that we have been talking about which is the slowdown in wireline capital investment and we solved that in all regions in the quarter especially in Europe. Overall in our Network Segment we have a strong position fewer strengthen in it but our sales are clearly being impacted by the capital spend levels of our customers. We expect that segment sales in quarter two will be essentially flat compared to quarter 1 and we do expect the sequential improvement in our sales to the telecom service providers but this will be offset by decline in our energy markets due to seasonality.", "Let's turn to slide six and I\u2019ll cover Specialty Products and Undersea Telecom. Sales in our Specialty Product segment declined 7% overall versus the prior year and sequentially sales declined 3%. For the second quarter, we expect segment sales to be similar to quarter one levels. ", "Sales to the aerospace, defense and marine market declined 16% versus the prior year and 5% sequentially, driven by continued weakness in the commercial aerospace market. Order rates have stabilized and in quarter two, we expect a low single-digit increase in revenue sequentially. In our Touch Systems business, sales were flat versus prior year, and were down 3% sequentially.", "Sales to the retail market have improved however gaming and industrial markets remain weak. In our circuit protection business, sales increased 14% versus the prior year and were up 3% sequentially as sales to consumer related end markets such as automotive, computer and mobile phones continue to improve. We do expect that next quarter; we will get our normal sequential seasonal decline in our circuit protection business. ", "And lastly in our medical products business, sales decreased 10% versus prior year and 3% sequentially as we continue to be effective by reduced spending by medical equipment customers. If you look at the right side of the chart, in our Undersea Telecommunication segment, as expected sales declined 24% versus prior year and 25% sequentially to approximately $200 million. ", "We ended the quarter with a backlog slightly below $800 million, and in quarter two, we expect revenues of approximately $225 million due to the construction progress on the West African system, and we do expect our operating margin to be in the mid teens. Based upon progress on this project, we now expect sales for the full year to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million.", "Let me now turn the discussion to earnings, which will start on slide seven. Our GAAP operating income for the quarter was $269 million which includes restructuring and other charges of $63 million. The restructuring costs include a $48 million of cost related to both equipment and headcount reduction actions that we previously initiated as well as the losses of $15 million related to the sale of the Dulmison product line that we completed in the first quarter. We continue to be on track on our footprint simplification and during the quarter we closed two sites in Europe and divested three sites with the Dulmison sale which brings our site count to 92 down from 97 just the year-end. We expect that our charges will be smaller next quarter at $20 million due to the timing of additional site closures. And for the full year we continue to expect that our restructuring charges will remain approximately $200 million. ", "Adjusted operating income was $332 million with an adjusted operating margin of 11.5% we were solidly profitable in all four segments and our component segment adjusted operating margin exceeded 10% for the first time since 2008. The pull through on the sequential sales and improvement in margin demonstrates the company's improved operating leverage and in quarter two we expect adjusted operating margins to approach our 12% financial goal that we laid out in the first quarter of '09 at slightly less than the $12 billion annual sales run-rate. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.47 up 57% from the fourth quarter reflecting the growth in our gross margin and operating income.", "So let's move to slide eight. Our gross margin the first quarter was 29% which was an increase of 200 basis points versus the prior year. The 29% was the targeted margin we laid out needed to achieve the 12% margin at a $12 billion sales level. The 200 basis points of improvement in the gross margin versus as prior year was driven by our cost fractions in 2009 and was partially offset by slightly unfavorable sales mix and the benefit of building inventory in last year\u2019s first quarter.", "Comparing gross margin to last quarter, our gross margin increased up from 26% to the 29%. This sequential increase was driven by further cost benefits and production levels that were inline with sales as we complete our inventory reduction efforts last quarter. We did expect about a 200 basis point improvement from stopping our inventory reduction efforts in quarter four and we clearly saw that in our gross margin increase.", "Looking at the bottom half of the slide on operating expenses and this includes both our RD&E and SG&A. They were down $49 million on a year-on-year basis or about 9%. Excluding the effects of currency, we reduced the operating expenses by approximately $22 million to a combination of headcount reduction and spending controls. On a sequential basis operating expenses were up approximately 8% driven primarily by the increases in pension expense and performance compensation as well as increased investment in RD&E. ", "Now let me turn to slide nine and cover items on the P&L below the operating margin line. Net interest expense was $35 million in the quarter versus $36 million in the prior year. The benefit of lower debt levels was offset by lower levels of interest income. Other income which relates to our tax share agreement was $8 million compared to $1 million of expense in the prior year for quarter two I expect this will be approximately $11 million of income. The GAAP effective tax was 29% in the quarter and the tax rate on adjusted income was 28% which was inline with our guidance. In quarter two, we expect the tax rate on adjusted income will continue to be approximately 28%. ", "Now let me talk the cash flow which starts on slide 10. Our free cash flow in quarter one was $256 million compared to a use of $79 million in the prior year period and as Tom said, this was very good performance when you consider that quarter one is our lowest cash flow performance quarter. The increase we saw was due to higher income levels, lower capital expenditures as well as lower cash taxes, as well as keeping our working capital management in check. ", "On the cash tax, we do expect that our full year cash tax rate will be in the low to mid teens and this is lower than our typical 20% cash tax rate as in 2010\u00a0we will benefit from net operating losses that we generated last year in certain jurisdictions outside the United States. ", "As I mentioned free cash flow also benefited from our solid working capital performance. Our day sales outstanding of $63 million was down eight days versus the prior year and improved three days sequentially. Our inventory days on hand excluding contracts and progress were down 33 days year-over-year and improved one day sequentially to 58 days. ", "And remember that in quarter one last year was our high point, we did build inventory, but I feel we did an excellent job throughout 2009 bringing it down and we kept it in check here as the business has ramped up. As I have also mentioned at quarter four earnings call, we do expect inventory days will come back up in to the 60s as we go through the year. ", "From the capital spending side, we spent $76 million in quarter one, down from prior year levels of $115 million. With the full year, we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately 4% of our sales, was at the low end of our typical spending as we\u2019ve improved our capital productivity. ", "On the restructuring side, from a cash perspective, we spent $67 million in the quarter and for the full year we continue to expect cash restructuring spending of approximately $300 million. And overall, we expect that our 2010 free cash flow including the cash restructuring spend and the benefit of a lower cash tax rate will still be in our free cash flow approximating net income. ", "Let\u2019s move to slide 11 which covers our debt and liquidity position. At the beginning of the quarter, we started with $1.5 billion of cash and we ended the quarter with $1.7 billion of cash. Use of the cash during the quarter included a return of capital to shareholders of $92 million which included dividends of $74 million and share repurchases of $18 million. ", "In regard to the dividend, as part of our upcoming annual meeting in March, we will be asking shareholders to improve fourth quarterly dividends of $0.16 per share starting with the third fiscal quarter of 2010 and ending in the second fiscal quarter of 2011. Our plan is to continue to review our dividend payout rate in connection with our annual meetings. As we stated during investor day, we will continue to hold excess capital for flexibility and to maintain our ability to fund strategic acquisitions. ", "During the first quarter we repurchased $18 million of our shares and with the strength of our cash flow and current cash levels, we plan to increase our share repurchases in the second quarter. Also from the proceeds or generation of cash, during the quarter we completed the sale of Dulmison product line which was part of our Network Solutions segment for $12 million. This business had annual sales of about $50 million with operating margins in the low single digits.", "And finally as Tom mentioned, regarding the acquisition related to our touch system business that closed last week, this will be a capital use in the second quarter of approximately $62 million.", "So, let me turn the call back over to Tom.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks Terrence. I\u2019m going to talk about the second quarter outlook now. You can turn to slide 12. In Q2 we expect our sales to be in the range of $2.85 billion to $2.95 billion. Organically our sales are expected to be flat to slightly up versus Q1 again, we do feel good about end demand but the inventory replenishment, a piece that\u2019s driving our revenue is going to slow down in the back half for this quarter. We expect adjusted operating income to be in the $335 million to $370 million range compared to $332 million in Q1. The continued improvement and sequential profitability is primarily due to improved leverage from productivity gains in the Electronic Component segment and this should result in a gross margin in the 30% range up from 29% in Q1.", "And our adjusted EPS from continuing operations are expected to be $0.49 to $0.54 which is a range of sequential increase of 4% to 15%. So, in summary, really pleased with the start to the year, off to a good start, second quarter shaping up. Then most of our end markets are improving, although as we mentioned several times, we do expect the inventory replenishment portion of our demand to slow down this quarter towards the end of this quarter. ", "Our delivery is improving but it still has more to go there for sure and we are improving on that everyday. I think we feel best about what we've done with the operating leverage in the company which was just the top priority when we separated the company almost three years ago. Cash flow continues to be strong and in particular, the working capital management of the company has improved significantly over the last several years.", "And we're last but certainly not least, we're really excited about having the Sensitive Object team as part of the Tyco Electronics team. We are very, very bullish on our touch business. This team we're bringing in has tremendous talent and capabilities and we think to compromise those two is going to enable us to continue to grow that business significantly. So, with that let's open it up for questions. Operator? ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin the question-and-answer-session session of our conference. (Operator Instructions). Our first question will come from the line of Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "You guys have done a fairly exceptional job I think of getting back to this 12% margin target on sub $3 billion revenues based on the guide. I'm just curious as we move forward, I think the big question, it was on a struggle where there is, do you guys still have room to sustain these out priced margin expansions or going forward will margin expansion be more driven by sales though the (inaudible) leverage will return back to the sale mid 20% contribution margin rates. So could you maybe just talk about how the model works beyond the 12-12 target, and do you have any restructuring savings left to be realized on the cogs of (inaudible) for fiscal '10.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks Amit for the comments, and yeah I think the way you summarized it is actually the way we see it. We have had obviously significant lift in the last couple of quarters, combination of the inventory of reductions being behind us, the restructuring kicking in and the resizing. Going forward its going to be a more normal margin flow through of 25% to 30%. The productivity improvement is certainly a very high priority in the company. There is a little bit of restructuring left to benefit the next year, year and a half and Terrence can comment on that in a minute, but I would think of it is, you know we're going to get back to normal margin flow through and as we said a month and a half ago, we were in New York investor day and we now see a 15% operating margin in target in the $14 to $15 billion sales range. So that\u2019s at a much lower level that we had laid out two or three years ago because of all the progress we've made on portfolio restructuring and just general cost saving.", "Terrence Curtin", "Yes from the restructuring prospective on that, when you look at it like we said, coming out of last year we had about $15 million as savings that still need to click in and that clicked in the first quarter. There are some other effects going out through the year but it's pretty negligible, it's not big. So, it does come per volume. So I think you're thinking about it right home. ", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "My second question was, yeah I think last quarter even at the analyst day you guys, we talked about auto production being up about 10% in fiscal '10 but there was some caution what China would do with the incentive programs on the auto side. Yeah, now that China actually extended the incentive programs, could you just talk about how are we thinking about auto production in 2010 and what does it mean for Tyco's auto business specifically?", "Tom Lynch", "I think from when we talked to you last time, the estimates by the industry are a little bit higher in the $62 million - $64 million range, that\u2019s where we moved from. So obviously we should benefit from that. Again we are watching it closely but clearly it was stronger in December than we thought. And I think the industry as a whole was stronger in January than the industry was projecting that would be. So right now the experts are calling $64 million for the year. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line Matt Sheerin of Thomas Weisel Partners. Please go ahead. ", "Matt Sheerin - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Just ask another question regarding auto. Looks like you are seeing a little bit of more inventory refresh in the March quarter. Do you get any sense of what inventories look like at your customers there? Do you think they are going to end up being at normal levels when this refresh is done below normal or even better than that?", "Tom Lynch", "", "Well, we pick up some data but I would say our view of it is that as this normalizes and production and our sales get more inline within production as the inventory get outs out in the whole supply chain. You're going to see at or slightly lower than where they ran in the past, just talking to most of our customers a year and year and half ago. They said, we probably had too much inventory. So, I think its going to end up a little lower but that\u2019s hard to call right now because when things get tight, everybody pushes hard to make sure they get more than enough inventory. I think everybody is going to get a little smarter I guess the way it ends. ", "Matt Sheerin - Thomas Weisel Partners", "And I guess my point Tom is that we've seen this from a lot of other suppliers where business is very strong or even seeing because of overheated order environment and for Tyco, are you planning, or you bracing for any sort of volatility that might come either whether the June quarter or September quarter, will you see orders decline because there is an inventory adjustment or some supply chain adjustment the other way and how are you planning your business around that?", "Tom Lynch", "We are planning for orders to decline in automotive starting the end of this quarter and to be down in Q3 and Q4. Our estimate is that in the last couple of quarters, we've benefited from about $100 million, $75 to $100 million of replenishment of the pipeline over and above kind of which you'd normally expect. So it's definitely our revenues hotter than end demand right now and we're factoring that into our planning for second half.", "Terrence Curtin", "And Matt just to add to what Tom said, we talked about the 64 million vehicles. We do expect that quarter one production levels were about $16.5 million vehicles in quarter one. That also we're planning to come down to about 15.5 million vehicles on average through the rest of the year quarter two throughout quarter four. So that's how we are looking at the year. ", "Matt Sheerin - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay that\u2019s helpful and just on the Toyota news with the recall and it looks like they are halting production on certain models. Does that impact your business at all short-term?", "Terrence Curtin", "Short term would have a minimal impact that's all included in our guidance per the quarter. So it's not a big impact when you look at it.", "Operator", "", "Our next question will come from the line of Steven Fox of CLSA please go ahead.", "Steven Fox - CLSA", "Hi good morning. Tom you mentioned that you're having some confidence in the second half of the calendar year I think in your prepared remarks. Away from auto, are you seeing certain signs that are pointing to sustainable demand or improving demand in certain markets that you could highlight further beyond and say this quarter?", "Tom Lynch", "Yeah I think for the last couple of quarters sequentially we've seen first the recovery and then the pickup and the recall our industrial and infrastructure businesses within our Component segment. So that selling to the capital equipment makers, telecom infrastructure. We\u2019ve seen a pick up in appliances particularly in emerging markets; there has been a fair amount of stimulus in China for example on appliances. ", "Our networks business hasn\u2019t turned yet. As Terrence mentioned, that\u2019s still down sequentially little bit of that is seasonality but we are talking to customers, we are starting to see signs that we expect that to start going in the positive direction in the second half. The same with aerospace, our aerospace defense and marine business, you know again that was down about 5% sequentially. We think later second half that will start to pick up and hopefully the (inaudible) will begin to build and so the product will have to get laid in for that pipeline. ", "So, the way I think of that sort of the big picture, and with that not getting specific on guidance obviously because visibility is pretty limited but auto as I said on the prior question is going down we would expect, based on everything we see, not dramatically its still doing a lot better than we would have thought three or six months ago and the industrial infrastructure network specially product side of the business is going to come out of the troughs so to speak.", "Steven Fox - CLSA", "And then just Terrance on the cash flow side, would we expect in the next few quarters to see similar say free cash flow to net income ratios. Is there anything we should be thinking about plus or minus beyond what you guys just did in terms of free cash flow trends?", "Terrence Curtin ", "No I think just where we are and with the guidance that we gave going from quarter one to quarter two, I think you are going to continue to see pretty solid cash flow. We may have some other restructuring cash, it could be lumpy but I think you're not going to big spikes upper, big spikes down.", "Steven Fox - CLSA", "", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Tom Lynch", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of William Stein of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "William Stein - Credit Suisse", "Thanks. Couple of quick questions, first I though as if you already gone through this; on the restructuring, I think in the past we have discussed a small amount of incremental savings from the footprint reduction flowing through in March. Can you tell me whether is that contemplated in guidance and is there anything further that we should expect within a sequential basis into June there will be on from structure.", "Terrence Curtin", "Well, it's Terrence. It's about an incremental $10 million from quarter one into quarter two and that is included in our guidance.", "William Stein - Credit Suisse", "And is that quarter-over-quarter savings?", "Terrance Curtin", "That\u2019s from quarter one to quarter two, it\u2019s sequential.", "William Stein - Credit Suisse", "Okay and anything beyond that at this point?", "Terrance Curtin", "Negligible.", "William Stein - Credit Suisse", "Negligible. Okay, then I was hoping you could for a second discuss the touch screen acquisition. Remind us where you are positioned now and what is the acquisition bringing in the future?", "Tom Lynch", "We have been in the touch business for several years and its genesis was really out of the Raychem company that was acquired 10 years ago on the material science that goes into enabling touch so very natural place for company to have gone and we like the business for the obvious reasons. Our focus, our success, we have pretty nice position in many market, the leadership position in the commercial and industrial so if you go into photo kiosks, retail, hospitals more often than not, its our touch screen, not always branded our touch screens says we are able to sometimes brand them for our customers. So that\u2019s been a good solid part of our business.", "The other thing about touch is, there is a number of different technologies depending on the application so the same technology that you would use on an iPhone, which is not a technology we have, we wouldn't use in an industrial saying because it's not robust enough. What this Sensitive Objects does is it brings Acoustic Pulse Recognition capability. It's a different type of touch enabling technology, it's relatively new. We've been developing in our business as well again for commercial application and so it's been developing it for consumer and mobile applications and between them we had a tremendous amount of increased our just sheer technical horsepower around the capability which is very promising about it is that its lower power, you don't really need a template. So if you think of a touch screen today, there is a screen over the actual monitor that you touch and with that also enables is that you can use any kind of stylus for this kind of touch, so you could use your finger, you could use the stylus, the old PDA kind of thing", "As we said in the opening comments, we're still a year to two years away from many significant product, so this is R&D investment for us, but we have a very nice position in the touch business. We wanted to strengthen it, and this is something we've been looking at for a while. We've worked with this group for a while, so we're very excited to have them as a part of the team now.", "William Stein - Credit Suisse", "Great, and then just a follow-up on that. Can you talk to us a little bit about the acquisition pipeline as it stands today?", "Tom Lynch", "Yes. Sure, I mean the acquisition pipeline is, it's getting more robust. We've been working on it for 18 months. I think we've been, this is our first one. We've been thoughtful about it because we had to get through the divestiture pipeline first, and get in better fighting trims so to speak to be ready to do M&A, but we've been working a number of opportunities for a while. As you also know it takes a while and you have to be very active to get down to a couple so we have come a long way in the last year in that pipeline.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line Amitabh Passi of UBS. Please go ahead.", "Amitabh Passi - UBS", "Operating margins and network solutions quite a bit decreased sequentially quarter-over-quarter even though sales were only down marginally just wanting what might have contributed to that?", "Terrence Curtin", "When you look at it, one thing I would be in pressure that if you go back to my revenue comments is that in our service provider market as the Telcos have really cut back capital and have cut back specifically in wire line that has really hurt our margin and the Network Solutions segment overall just from a mix prospective. So when you look at it that business was down 25% year-over-year as well as almost down 10% sequentially. So that is putting a burden on the gross margin and operating margin in that segment. We do think that we have hit sort of a bottom point in that business. We did see some uptick in orders late in the quarter. So really it all comes down to really a market mix is what we are dealing with right now.", "Amitabh Passi - UBS", "Okay and then just related specifically within the communication service provider's sub-segment of Network Solutions. We have increasingly operators talking about decreasing investment in wireline and sort of focusing more in wireless. I am just curious strategically any intention of expanding your solution set within that sub-segment to sort of address may be the wireless service provider community.", "Tom Lynch", "Well I wouldn\u2019t get that specific but I would say generally if you think about where our primary focus on M&A and partnerships is exceptionally and specialty products and networks. So we really like the networks business between our Undersea Telecom although that\u2019s not in the network segment but if you think of all of our telecom business, our component side of it, our enterprise business and the service provider business. We are at top one, two or three player depending on the region and all those but we like to stay clearly with broadband now continuing to proliferate and outpace everybody\u2019s expectations in terms of all the data that\u2019s lying over the networks.", "We think in the long haul it\u2019s an attractive space and it\u2019s a space we'd like to get stronger and so it's an important one to us. I think in the short-term, this proportionate switch I would say were reemphasis or increased emphasis because of the smart phone impact on capacity into wireless which is great stuff for anybody that\u2019s in the networks business is slowing down our wireline business. There is going to be significant opportunity though as the structure continues to change to more fiber connecting the base station.", "So, we are still very attractive about the fiber piece of it. But overall we like the business and some of the things in our pipeline and definitely focus on that business.", "Amitabh Passi - UBS", "", "Great and just one final question, Tom. I think you talked about your China automotive business, I guess approaching a $300 million annual run rate. I am just wondering should we expect any meaningful regional shifts this year within your Automotive Segment looks like Asia is about 25%, 26% and then related to that, I think in the past you have talked about a $58 to $60 roughly per vehicle content. I mean does that sort of materially change as we progress for the rest of the year?", "Tom Lynch", "", "In terms of the region, the $300 million were last year\u2019s revenue in China. I think we are going to be on closer to $400 million this year and so obviously that markets robust we have been there a long time and we provide a wider range of capability than we typically do in a mature market especially to the local OEM because they are earlier on the learning curve. So it's very attractive for us. I think we will continue to see Asia driven by China and India become a bigger part of our overall automotive business. I don\u2019t think you are going to see massive changes year-over-year but a gradual study that becomes a bigger part of our business as far as content goes we really haven\u2019t seen anything significant yet when we think about content we think about increasing our content from model. So as I think about it really the content in every model whether it\u2019s a low end two cylinder car or an 8 cylinder, 12 cylinder car in Europe the contents going up for all the reasons you know about the averaging impact of; hey there are more small cars this year than last, there is a little bit of that but its we have always estimated that as a $1, $2 and its definitely in that range of no significant shifts.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva of Citi please go ahead.", "Jim Suva - Citi", "Thank you and congratulations, gentlemen. I have two questions the first question is on the acquisition that you did it appears that this is kind of a pre revenue company or early stage company is that the type of M&A strategy you are pursuing or are you looking at more companies that are in production for your M&A pipeline and then my second question is earlier in your prepared comments you have made the comment that you were progressing on your restructuring according to plan and on track. When I look at your guidance for next quarter it's below a 12 billion run rate and your operating margins are above 12%. So it appears that you are not actually on track, it appears you're [faster] star rating because that would then also conclude that you are not getting any additional future benefits from restructuring so those are my two questions.", "Tom Lynch", "I would say on the M&A strategy it really depends on the opportunity or the gap we are trying to fill. So in we are going to do both, you typically expect the smaller ones like the one we did with a sense of object or if we do other smaller on the technology side it would really be to make sure we are building out our technology capability in a particular product line. You know there\u2019s a lot of technology changing fast and us being a significant player in every market you can\u2019t do it all yourself. So we really have built out and continue to build out a nice network of companies we look at universities we partner with to make sure we are on the leading edge at a minimum of understanding what's going on but preferably participating in some of them. So we\u2019ve done small and this is a relatively big one of this type which is why we are talking about it.", "I would say generally speaking, if you talk about what we are going to spend on these kind of things the majority of what we are going to spend and invest will be on the company with that revenue. I would expect that. So if you look back a year or two from now and you say; hey we spent x I would expect a vast majority of that x is going to be on companies that are revenue generating companies from the get go. But this one is one, we\u2019ve been dealing with this company for a while. We really like their team and their capability. And it's just a great hit with us so this is a free revenue. But I wouldn\u2019t put it in the startup category, they have been around for several years and have excellent partnerships and excellent technology.", "And then on the margin rate I\u2019ll make a comment and then turn it over to Terrence to elaborate on it. Lets say, if we hit this 12% as we expect to in Q2 at less than $12 billion revenue, I think the important thing is we are on track right now, we are tracking to right where we wanted to be in any particular quarter could it be 12.3 versus 11.7 at the $3 billion revenue range, it could be depending on the mix of distribution, the mix of end market what is going on with [CapEx] but we are really pleased with the fact that we have got the operating leverage to this point which gives us a high degree of confidence that for the next wave as volume is back to more normal levels we are going to have the next set function improvement. Terrence you want to talk of restructuring?", "Terrence Curtin", "Yes, Tom mentioned of Raychem, cost actions and what we went through last year we are getting cost based in check was one element, certainly it was improving our productivity and the operating leverage on just cooperation and what we saw during the quarter was with the volume improvement we had mainly in the component segment, we were able to convert very nicely on it, not just there was a cross actions but also improved operating leverage. So, it\u2019s the cost action when we look at, what laid out last year, that\u2019s completely on track what I covered back on investor day from a footprint has on track and that hasn\u2019t change but really what we got is when the volume came through, we executed very well in converting that volume and have a very nice flow through. And so the benefits that are still to come are like I said small sequentially in quarter one to quarter two about $10 million but we are also getting efficiencies in our plant. As volume has ramped and that\u2019s really what you are seeing in the guidance and around that $2.9 billion to $3 billion level like Tom said we would expect to be around 12%. ", "Jim Suva - Citi", "Great, thank you and congratulations gentlemen. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Shawn Harrison of Longbow Research. Please go ahead. ", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Getting back to the automotive question, I just wanted to be clear that as we get into the bank half of your fiscal year automotive maybe a little bit of a headwind to growth, is that what you were trying to suggest with the statements?", "Tom Lynch", "You could look at it that way. It's because anytime you are in inventory replenishment cycles you're going to get the suppliers like us are going to sell, we are going to grow at a higher rate than actual end production and I mean if you go back to the last year production was down in '09, 22% we were down 31% and in some quarters, it was much more pronounced than that. This year in the first quarter production was up double digits, and we were up 10% more than that, so you see the catch up happening that, I think that's actually lasted a little longer than we expected. ", "We would have expected it to end a couple of months earlier, but it's still happening which I sense is a good sign of where our OEM customers think and demand in, but we have the short answer Shawn is yes, all things being equal the way we see them now. Automotive revenue for us would be a little lower in the second half and the first half. ", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Okay, and then as we get into maybe what is within the electronic components business, a more normalized environment, what is the typical seasonality that we should now expect given some of the changes in mix on a typical say third and fourth quarter?", "Tom Lynch", "Typically, we haven\u2019t been there for few years, what we've gone through Shawn but if you look at it typically, components typically has a normal [point] if you go back to '07 type period before that, typically where we get impacted is quarter one and quarter four are weaker quarters impacted by shutdown in the first quarter by OEMs around automotive around the holidays and also in the fourth quarter due primarily to our European automotive sides there that you get the European holiday. So typically both of those quarters are about 5% lower and a normal environment than our second and third quarters. So you really have that the middle quarters are your stronger quarters in component and then the first and forth were a little bit later.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Okay and then on Network Solutions maybe if you could just speak of within the three individual segments, what are you saying on a calendar year basis, in terms of capital budgets. Will there be growth if there is, it sounds like its going to be back half waited but maybe if you could just elaborate on what customers you are telling about their capital budgets for 2010?", "Tom Lynch", "What they are saying is they expected it to start showing up in the summer I would say, late spring or early summer which would be our second half, we are seeing some signs of that but this is also typically the weakest time for those businesses particularly service providers and energy because all that works are applied. And our strongest areas are the U.S. and Europe and increasing strength in Asia but most of the world were our businesses is pretty cold right now. So it\u2019s a typical slow down. I think it\u2019s a little hard to call right let's say you go back to 6 or 9 months ago and sort of tell us it was going to slow down that turned to be the way it was. Now they are telling us its going to start picking up so we are hopeful of that and we've seen just little signs of it but got to watch it closely.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "And by picking up I means is that low to maybe mid-single digit year-over-year growth or something like that not double digits. Its just may be a way to kind of gauge our expectations.", "Tom Lynch", "Well year-over-year what you are going to have is when you compare year-over-year certainly those businesses came down later in '09 versus, so their first quarters were typically strong. What I think to what Tom said, Shawn you will get a seasonal pickup in the summer months naturally coming into our third and fourth quarter in these businesses what I would say is do we get a sort of a multiplier effect that spending kicks back in from a compare perspective.", "So I think you will see year-on-year growth in those businesses in the summer months. That is just due to natural seasonality versus how they came down last year but the real question that I think when we look at the orders is, is there a sort of a spending catch up that happens in those late quarters. ", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Brian White of Ticonderoga. Please go ahead.", "Brian White - Ticonderoga", "I am wondering if you could talk a little bit about the pricing environment and how you are handling rising commodity costs.", "Tom Lynch", "", "Pricing hasn\u2019t really changed too much. If we look at our overall pricing erosion it's still running south of 2%. I think that we are a little bit better at it than we have been in the past is where we have the opportunity to react to commodity costs, we're doing that. As you know this is a business of literally thousands of price quotes a week. But generally speaking, haven\u2019t seen any major shift in pricing at all. ", "", "Terrence Curtin", "", "And then Brian just to add to that, just to frame the commodity environment that we are in right now, with the fixing program we've done and last year we turned off the hedges so we didn\u2019t get a big windfall last year due to metals. Right now we\u2019re probably experiencing may be a $5 million per quarter headwind in quarter one and quarter two due to metals and its really more on gold and copper and that probably increases up to a $10 million later half in the year if gold stays around the 1,100 (inaudible) a day and copper is around the 330.", "Tom Lynch", "Some of our risk management techniques are also protecting this. ", "Brian White - Ticonderoga", "And when we look at your seven different markets in the Electronic Components business, which one do you think will show the greatest strength in the March quarter sequentially and the greatest strength over the next year?", "Tom Lynch", "Do you mean just pure just growth numbers?", "Brian White - Ticonderoga", "Growth numbers yes.", "Tom Lynch", "Yeah not necessarily [Multiple Speakers] year over year.", "Brian White - Ticonderoga", "Just sequentially in the March quarter versus the December quarter and then if we also look out over the next 12 months.", "Tom Lynch", "Well I think the compares, I mean if you compare it to the low, auto has already got a couple of months of improvement under it. I would say industrial, because it started later but that's a lot smaller business than auto for us although we are a leading player there.", "Terrence Curtin", "As well as data comp.", "Brian White - Ticonderoga", "Data comp.", "Tom Lynch", "Yeah that really started to show momentum this quarter. ", "Terrence Curtin", "Yeah I mean think about it, with the trend that Tom talked about already [prime], one of the things that was nice about what we saw in our first quarter was the industrial markets, when we talk sequentially, all orders been up 15% in the first quarter sequentially. It was pretty much 15% in the consumer markets and the industrial markets that we serve and that covers EC, Specialty Products and Network. So we are starting to see some more momentum at this phase. I think it will be more along those industrial type infrastructure markets later in the year.", "Brian White - Ticonderoga", "And how about just activity customers coming our with new products? Where is the most activity in the different markets that you're serving in electronic components?", "Terrence Curtin", "I think the most activity is always in the consumer in the mobile space in terms of just because of the life cycle of the product. So they are shorter, but clearly there is a tremendous amount of development going on in the automotive space and hybrid vehicles where we have a really excellent product line in more and more entertainment in the cars and you know changing, looking at more efficient infrastructures in the cars, a lot of activity around weight reduction and size reduction of everything including our components and even though there might be a small part of the equation in a jet or a car still a lot of the demand for our customer. So the technology envelope continues to be pushed. I don\u2019t think we saw much slowdown in that during the downturn which I think plays to a company like our strength because we kept up the investment. We didn\u2019t back off at all.", "Tom Lynch", "Steve we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Our last question will come from the line of Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America", "Terrence can you quantify the components of increased OpEx quarter-over-quarter particularly the pension expense and performance comps and should we expect an increase sequentially from here adding into fiscal second quarter.", "Terrence Curtin", "Yeah, Wamsi let me, if you look sequentially and you strip out currency, we were up about $35 million from quarter four to quarter one, engineering was up about $5 million, the pension expense was about $5 million and the remainder was incentive compensation. Going sequentially out through the quarters, we do see and the things we touched on investor day, our engineering continuingly to increase as we do some of the investments we covered on investor day but I think the way to think about it is right now when we look at the year we're probably going to be around 13% SG&A rate this year and R&D will be around 5% of sales if we stay around our top line at where we're right now.", "Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America", "And then on share repurchases, you bought back a little bit here in this quarter. How should we think about it through the course of the fiscal year?", "Terrence Curtin", "", "We have 600 million outstanding on our authorization still, so we will continue to look at it. What are the strategic opportunities? We do see that increasing off the first quarter levels and will assess it as we see market conditions and as we see our cash generation. So, I think you can see it increasing as we go through the year.", "Tom Lynch", "", "Okay, we'll wrap up then. Thank you for taking the time today to join us, I think we had a questions that we could not get to, I apologize. We want be respectful of everyone\u2019s time. Yeah, our team will be around all day to answer any follow-up questions. So thank you and have a good day.", "Terrence Curtin ", "", "Thanks everyone.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen today\u2019s conference call will be available from today at 10:30 Eastern Time until February 3 midnight of that day.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to your host, the Vice President, Investor Relations Mr. John Roselli. Please go ahead.", "John Roselli", "Thank, [Tasha] and good morning. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Tyco Electronics second quarter results for fiscal year 2010 and our outlook for the third quarter and full year. With me today is our Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch and our Chief Financial Officer, Terrence Curtin.", "During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask you to look at today\u2019s press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary statements that we\u2019ve included there. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning and we ask you to read through the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that addressed the use of these items. The press release and related tables along with the slide presentation can be found on the investor relations portion of our website at tycoelectronics.com.", "Also, as we announced this quarter we\u2019ve renamed our Undersea Telecommunications business to (inaudible) Subsea Communications or Sub-Comp in short, you will hear us refer to it that way today.", "Now, let me turn the call over to Tom for some opening comments.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks, John, good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s start with slide three. I guess the best opening would be a lot difference the year makes. We really had an outstanding quarter in the second quarter. Our sales were up 27% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Our operating margin up 13.9% was up 240 basis points sequentially and well ahead of our 12/12 goal.", "Our gross margin of 32.4% was the highest since 2007 when the company separated. Our earnings per share of $.64, was up 36% sequentially and significantly exceeded our guidance. If you recall our guidance, the midpoint of our guidance was $0.52 and we were over that by $0.12, $0.08 of that was operational, $0.04 was tax and intangibles, we will be walking you through that in detail. And our free cash flow was strong at $422 million and we are on track to deliver in excess of $1.2 billion of free cash flow for the year.", "The performance was due to definitely improving economic environments with strong execution on the company\u2019s part as well. The global economics environment continued to improve this quarter and we were able to capitalize on this trend. Our Electronic Components segment was up 55% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. This growth was broad based across all geographic regions and end markets and our CFO will walk you through each of the markets in detail in a few minutes.", "This more than offset the decline on our Subsea Communications segment, as you know we have been foreshadowing and discussing that expected decline for several quarters now. We're really encouraged by the demand strength in most of our electronic components end markets and expect sales to stay at the current level in the second half as continued growth in the industrial markets offsets normal seasonal decline in automotive in the fourth quarter. And it's pretty clear that the environment is much better than three months ago and when we started three months ago significantly better than we expected when we started here six months ago.", "During the second quarter we did begin to see a pickup in business levels in our Specialty Products and Network Solutions segment and as a result we expect revenue to increase about 10% in the second half in these segments. As you know these segments turndown later than components and they are recovering about two quarters later. Again this growth will more then offset the further softening in our Subsea business, which is now going to settle in at about 150 million per quarter range.", "I\u2019m also really pleased with our continued improvement in execution. Our gross margin increased about three points sequentially to 32.4% and this drove the adjusted operating margin increase to 13.9%. Improving gross margin has clearly been a top priority for the company for several years, the reduction in our footprint coupled with our productivity programs are clearly delivering results.", "Our second quarter gross margin also benefited from (inaudible) point of favorable mix about half of which was due to very strong margins in the Subsea business. And those strong margins in Subsea Communications were directly related to excellent execution on the part of that team.", "We expect gross margins to be in the 31% range for the balance of the year, which is approximately two points higher than our 2008 levels on about 20% lower revenues. Our operating margin has exceeded our near term goal of 12% and we\u2019re well on our way towards (inaudible) milestone goal of 15%. We now expect to achieve 15% margins at a sales level of around 14 billion.", "Timing, we had another very good quarter of free cash flow of $422 million in the quarter. We paid a quarterly dividend of 70 million and repurchased approximately 5.7 million shares during the quarter.", "I also want to highlight our strategic progress in a couple of key areas as I typically do each quarter. In China, which is now the largest vehicle producing country in the world and they are on path to do 13 million to 14 million vehicles produced in China this year.", "Automotive vehicle production was up 63% year-over-year in the second quarter, our China automotive business grew almost 200% in the quarter and we\u2019re now on track to reach a $0.5 billion of sales through this market this year, so our China automotive business in fiscal year \u201910, our current year is going to be about $0.5 billion. We continue to build on our very strong positions with both the multi-national OEMs as well as the local Chinese OEM.", "In our Data Comm business, which is almost $1 billion in annual sales, our new high speed Data Comm product platforms continue to gain market acceptance and we have had several strategic win in U.S. and Asia over the last three months. It\u2019s been a high priority business for us and I think in the last year our new platforms are really starting to catch on an increased design wins are coming as a result of that.", "We also continued to improve our position in the mobile phone market with sales growth of 34% year-over-year. Over the past year we further strengthened our position with the leading handset makers and expanded our business across the high growth, high content smartphone segment of the market.", "As we know this continues to be a growing market, slowed down a bit last year, the smartphone portion of the market is really accelerating and there is significantly more content in smartphones for companies like ourselves and we feel we\u2019re very well positioned to take advantage of this shift in the market in overall growth.", "And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Terrence, who\u2019s going to cover our Q2 performance in more details.", "Terrence Curtin", "Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start by reviewing our sales performance by segment and market and then I\u2019ll get into earnings and cash flow. So if you start with slide four, this shows our overall revenue performance growth by segments both on a year-over-year and on a sequential basis.", "Total company sales of just under $3 billion were up 27% year-over-year and the quarter.  The growth was driven primarily by Electronic Components segment, which was up 55% with growth across all markets.", "Excluding our Subsea Comm business growth was broad-based across all regions at with Asia up 64%, Europe up 29% and the Americas up just shy 20%. We also benefited year-over-year from currency translation which had an impact of about 470 basis points on year-on-year growth or roughly $100 million.", "On a sequential basis our sales were up 2% with growth in the Electronic Components, Specialty Products and Subsea Communications segments, which is partially offset by a slight decline in our Network Solutions segment that was driven by typical seasonality.", "In our businesses serving the consumer markets which is about half of revenue, our sales increased 73% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Remember that this quarter last year was the low point in the downturn in these consumer markets. As expected, our Industrial and Infrastructure markets start to show improvement and our sales were up 3% versus the last quarter.", "Order rates in the Industrial and Infrastructure markets improved throughout the quarter as evidenced by our three largest segments having book-to-bill ratios of 1.05 or greater. Our orders were up 6% in these markets on a sequential basis and this momentum supports our outlook for the improvement in these markets for the remainder of this year.", "Now, let me get into segment performance by markets. When I talk to growth rates, all changes that I\u2019ll discuss will be on an organic basis. So if we can turn to slide five. On the left-hand side of slide, let\u2019s look at the key markets in our Components segments. In the automotive market, our sales versus the prior year increased 78% and sequentially were up 5% with growth in all regions.", "Sequentially, automotive production was flat as approximately 17.5 million vehicles. However as expected, we did benefit from continued restocking in the supply chain. Based upon current projections, quarter three auto production is expected to be slightly down to about 17 million vehicles. We expect that our sales in the automotive market will be similar to quarter two levels as the effects of restocking wind down and our sales get back in line with vehicle productions.", "And as Tom indicated, we do expect right now we will get normal seasonality beginning in the fourth quarter which typically is about a 5% decline going from quarter three to quarter four. In the Data Comm market, which includes sales to the communications equipment server and storage markets, our sales increased 8% year-over-year and were up 7% sequentially driven by the rebound that's occurring in the enterprise market, we\u2019re spending on broadband infrastructure and data storage equipment has increased.", "In the industrial equipment market, our sales were up 29% versus the prior year and up 18% sequentially. And we\u2019re seeing improved end demand overall as capital spending increases and China is leading the way of the demand up turn and we did also benefit in this market from some distributor restocking.", "In the appliance market our sales were up 56% versus the prior year and up 14% sequentially and we saw double-digit increases across all regions. In the computer market, our sales increased 19% versus the prior year and were up with 4% sequentially driven by end demand for notebook and netbook products.", "And finally, in the consumer device market, which includes our sales to the mobile phone and consumer electronics markets, our sales were up 39% versus the prior year, but sequentially we\u2019re down 8%. And the sequential decline was driven by post holiday declines and the end market demand.", "Let me talk about Network Solutions on the right-hand side of the slide, our sales in the segment declined 6% versus the prior year of 1% sequentially. The sales declines were driven by continued capital spending reductions by our customers and a seasonal decline in the energy market.", "As mentioned, these markets in segment are later cycle and in 2009 may began to decline approximately two quarters later than our consumer end markets. And we\u2019re seeing a similar lag on the way back up. Order rates have improved in the segment and our book-to-bill ratio for the quarter was 1.05.  ", "On the submarkets in this segment, sales to the energy market were down 7% versus prior year driven by continued lower spending and inventory reductions at the utility customers. Our revenues were down sequentially 5% due to the typical seasonality we get in this business in the winter months.", "In the enterprise network markets, our sales increased 8% versus the prior year and were flat sequentially, reflecting improvement in the datacenter, government, and education markets, while the commercial construction markets continue to be weak.", "Our sales to the service provider marker declined 15% versus the prior year due to the slow down in wireline capital investment in all regions. Revenues were however up 5%, sequentially due to increasing fiber deployments and international market, specifically Europe.", "We expect this up tick to continue as the increasing demand for data any time and any where requires more capacity in both the wired and wireless markets. For our third quarter we expect total segment sales in the Network Solutions segment to increase about 10% sequentially with growth in all of our markets. This will be our first year-on-year increase in this segment since the quarter downturn.", "Now let\u2019s move to slide six, to talk about Specially Products and Subsea Communications. On the left hand side starting with Specialty, sales in this segment increased 8% overall versus the prior year and 6%, sequentially. The book-to-bill was 1.08 in quarter two and for quarter three we expect a mid-single digit increase in revenues overall.", "Sales to the Aerospace, Defense & Marine market declined 8% versus the prior year, but we\u2019re up 8% sequentially due to improvement that we\u2019re seeing in the commercial aerospace and business jet market. During the quarter we saw a nice increase in our orders and for quarter three, we expect a low single digit increase in revenues sequentially.", "In the Touch Systems business, our sales were up 6% versus the prior year and up 5% sequentially. We are benefiting from our sales into the retail market as the capital spending in that area continues to improve during the quarter. For quarter three we expected double digit increase in revenues versus quarter two driven by improving conditions in both the industrial market and the improved capital retail spending trends I just mentioned.", "We are also seeing significant early interest in our newer Touch platforms that we talked about last quarter and although we don\u2019t anticipate any revenue from these platforms until next year. ", "In our circuit protection business, which serves mainly our consumer markets, sales increased 67% versus the prior year and sequentially revenues were down about 1% as expected due to the normal seasonal decline and sales for the consumer mobile device markets.", "And lastly, in specialty and our medical products business our sales decreased 5% versus the prior year while revenues were up 8% sequentially driven by improvement in disposable applications.", "Looking at the right of the chart in our Sub Comm segments, as expected sales declined 33% versus the prior year, sequentially revenues were up 4%. Our backlog ended the quarter at $616 million and we expect revenue at approximately $150 to $170 million in each of quarter three and quarter four, which would result in full-year sales in the range of $700 million to $750 million, which is down from $1.2 billion last year. Rating and coding activity remained solid, although we didn\u2019t put any large projects in the quarter.", "We did win a project for approximately $125 million that would be going into our backlog in quarter three and we have been awarded portions of two other projects in excess of $100 million each that are in the process of obtaining funding. All of these projects will benefit 2011 and our initial view of 2011 sales for the Sub Comm segment is in the range of $600 million to $700 million.", "Now let me discuss earnings which start on slide seven. Our GAAP operating income for the quarter was $398 million which includes restructuring and other changes of $12 million. In connection with our manufacturing simplification, we closed another two sites in the quarter and our current site total was 90. Our footprint simplification is on track and we expect to get down to a mid-80 site count by the end of 2011.", "We also continue to refine our cost estimates and timing of P&L charges and we expect approximately 30 million of charges in quarter three and for the full-year we now expect charges of approximately $120 million, currently for 2011 we expect approximately a $100 million or less in charges. Overall, we\u2019ve made excellent progress in streamlining the footprint and this has been the major contributor to our margin improvement as Tom mentioned.", "Adjusted operating income was $410 million in the quarter with an adjusted operating margin of 13.9%. The pull through on sequential sales and improvement in margin continues to demonstrate our improved operating leverage from our cross actions and our ongoing productivity programs, this was particularly evident in the Electronic Component segment where the adjusted margin was 13.6% compared to a loss last year.", "In addition, total company margin did benefit from the completion of certain contracts in the Subsea Communications segment, which positively affected overall margins by approximately 50 basis points in the quarter.", "In quarter three we expected our adjusted operating margins to continue to be above 13%. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.64 up $0.36 from the first quarter reflecting a growth in operating income and an approximately $0.04 benefit from a lower tax rate.", "Now let\u2019s move to slide eight. Turning at the top half of the slide, our gross margin in the second quarter was 32% and this gross margin is the highest level since our separation in 2007 and there is an increase of over 900 basis points versus the prior year and 300 basis points versus quarter one.", "As I mentioned, one-time items in the Sub-Comp segment benefited gross margins by approximately 50 basis points. In addition, gross margin also benefited from volume increases and a slightly favorable sales mix in our component segment. Excluding these beneficial effects gross margin would have been approximately 31% and this is where we expect to be for the remainder of the year.", "Looking at the bottom half of the slide, on operating expenses which did include both RD&E and SG&A, they were up $88 million year-on-year driven by the increase in sales as well as increased performance compensation and pension expense which I discussed last quarter. ", "Operating expenses were up approximately 8% versus the first quarter driven by further increases in performance compensation as the business has strengthened, as well as increased investment in RD&E and some currency transaction losses we had in the quarter versus currency gains that we had in the first quarter.", "We expect that our RD&E will continue to be approximately 5% of sales and that our SG&A will decline by approximately $15 million on a sequential basis in quarter three and [applying] on quarter four. As a percentage of sales, our SG&A showed approximately 13% for the rest of the year.", "Turning to slide nine; let me discuss items on the P&L below the operating line. Net interest expense was $32 million versus $38 million in the prior year due to lower debt levels. Adjusted other income which relates to our tax sharing agreement was $11 million compared to $3 million in the prior year, for quarter three, we expect this will remain approximately $11 million of income.", "The GAAP effective tax was 31% in the quarter and the tax rate on adjusted income was 23%, this lower adjusted tax rate benefited the EPS by approximately $0.04 versus our guidance. In quarter three and for the remainder of fiscal 2010, we expect the tax rate on adjusted income of approximately 26%. We also expect to be able to keep our adjusted tax rate at 26% beyond 2010 based on the planning that we\u2019ve completed.", "And you may recall that when we separated from Tyco International, our adjusted tax rate was in the mid 30s and our goal was reduced by 200 to 300 basis points over three years. I\u2019m very pleased with the progress we made to bring the rate down much faster than we originally anticipated. ", "Now let me talk about cash flow that\u2019s on slide 10. Our free cash flow in quarter two was $422 million compared to $370 million in the prior year quarter and this increase was due to higher income levels and slightly lower capital expenditures.", "Our adjusted cash tax rate was 8% in the quarter and continues to be lower than our normal cash tax rate of 20% as we\u2019re utilizing net operating losses incurred in the prior year in certain international locations. We do continue to expect that our full year cash tax rate will be in the low teens.", "Turning to our working capital metrics, we continue to have very good performance as business conditions improve. Our quarter two networking capital which is receivables plus inventory minus AP days was 66 days and that compares to 67 days last quarter and represents approximately a 20 plus percent reductions from where our working capital metrics were, create a downturn back in 2008.", "When you look at our day sales outstanding of 62 days that was down four days versus prior year and one day sequentially. On inventory days on hand excluding contracts in progress, we were down 20 days year-over-year and five day sequentially to 63 days, which is where we expected to be and we expect to be in the 60s as volumes stay at these levels.", "On capital, we spent $81 million on CapEx in quarter two, down slightly from prior year levels. We do expect our capital spending to pickup starting next quarter and we\u2019ll run approximately 4% of sales for the remainder of the year and for the full-year we expect capital spending to be about $400 million.", "Cash restructuring in the quarter was $55 million and for the full-year we now expect cash restructuring spending of approximately $200 million. When you take all of this, we expect our 2010 free cash flow will be greater than $1.2 billion and that includes to restructuring cash out flow.", "Let's move to slide 11 to talk about our balance sheet. We began this quarter with about $1.7 billion of cash and ended the quarter with $1.8 billion. Uses of cash during the quarter included return of capital to shareholders of $219 million, which included dividends of $72 million and share repurchases of $147 million. Also at our annual meeting that we held in March, shareholders improved four quarterly dividends of $0.16 per share starting with the third fiscal quarter of 2010.", "As we discussed on the last call, we plan to increases our share repurchases in quarter two and during the quarter we repurchased approximately 5.7 million share or $150 million. At the end of quarter two, we still have approximately 440 million remaining on the current share repurchase authorization and absent any significant acquisition activity, we would expect to use the reminder of this authorization in this fiscal year.", "And finally, as we talked last call, we did complete the acquisition of Sensitive Object during the quarter, which resulted in a net cash outflow of $55 million.", "Let me turn the call back over to Tom.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks, Terrence. I will now give the third quarter outlook, talk a little bit about the full year outlook, and recap what we\u2019ve just said and then we will open up the Q&A. For the third quarter, we expect our sales to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.1 billion, which is up 20% to 24% year-over-year and 1% to 5% sequentially.", "Excluded the expected decline in our Sub Comm segment, our year-over-year organic growth should be 30% to 34% and 47% sequentially due to the increased strength in our networks solution and specialty products segments.", "Adjusted operating income is expected to be in the range of $395 million to $420 million compared to $410 million in Q2. The Q3 operating margin should be in the range of 13.2% to 13.6% and this is a slight decline from where we are in Q2 driven by the Sub Comm margin decline which we would expect was very high, unusually high in Q2.", "Our Q3 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations are expected to be $0.61 to $0.65. At this time we are also reintroducing a full year outlook. Sales are expected to be in the range of $11.8 billion to $12 billion for our full fiscal year \u201810 which is 15% to 17% growth versus the prior year and up 22% to 24% excluding Sub Comm and this translates into full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations which are expected to be in the range of $2.32 to $2.40 compared to $0.83 last year.", "So just to wrap up, we really feel we had a good first half, clearly economic conditions improved during the first half and we\u2019re encouraged by our order rates over the last quarter as well as the first month of this quarter, (inaudible) we are equally feeling good about is the strong execution. If you comparer us to when we launched three years ago we have a much more focused business portfolio and much more efficient manufacturing footprint which we reduced by 33% in that time.", "And we\u2019re also better in the good old faction area of productivity, this has enabled us to improve gross margins at a 31% plus range and it\u2019s clearly demonstrating better operating leverage in the company, which was of the highest priorities for us as we separated.", "Cash flows will continue to be strong as we generate in excess of $1.2 billion this year. Stronger earnings, better management of our capital and continued improvement in working capital management. And then as we talked about a year ago when was business was difficult, we felt the best thing to do is to structure the business, take costs out to structure the business around to $12 billion revenue level that we generate 12% adjusted operating income. I think that\u2019s turned out to work out pretty well for us and we\u2019re now running at about 13% at the $12 million revenue level.", "And I feel very confidence that we have line of faith for 15% at a $14 million revenue level. And the way to think about that is, the model would look like this, gross margins in the 32% range R&D in the 5% of sales range, SG&A in the 12% of sales range and I would also translate to net income in the 10 plus percent of sales range and return on invested capital all in including good will at 20% plus. So I think we\u2019ve got to key it up, we have to continue to execute, but we feel like all the work of the past three years has really started to kick in.", "And then the last point, I think we\u2019re maintaining the right balance of keeping our strategic option open, options open in returning cash to share holder, as Terrence explained, we turned over 200 million, but I think as we\u2019ve consistently said our priority is to continue to strengthen the company strategically. We took a step to strengthen our Touch business last quarter, and it\u2019s still early -- with that acquisition of course, but we\u2019re excited about the prospects in the next couple of years and we are building an asset pipeline much more active than we\u2019ve been here in the last three years, but then I assure you that we\u2019re very thoughtful about the what we are going to do with that pipeline and how we are going to approach it.", "Well, with that, a good quarter and let\u2019s open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). And first question will come from the line of Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks a lot, good morning, guys. May be just to start off here, given the strength you guys have seen in your Electronic Component and the Specialty Products side, can you just talk about how much of that business is direct versus through the channel and then you see a material delta between your selling rates into the channel versus to the OEMs?", "Tom Lynch", "The normal split for our business is about 80% direct, 20% channel and what we considered direct is when we design in with the end customer, so in automotive that could be a product that ultimately goes through a tier 1, but we\u2019re getting design win by the end customer. And I would say to the second part of your question, we\u2019re not seeing any material difference in the buy rates from either category of the market.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Got it. And then nice to see the full year guide and you guys are pulling in a 15% margin target on 14 million sales now. If I kind of work to math roughly speaking, you guys are looking at about 20% incremental margins from today\u2019s -- the quarter you just reported?", "Terrence Curtin", "Sorry Matt, when you look at that remember we do get some benefit out of our Sub Comm business being 20 plus percent earnings and as we\u2019ve said all along, when it gets into where we guided that $600 million to $700 million next year, it should be in the lower teens. So you do need to adjust out for that. You would get in off that 13 plus rates that we\u2019ve got for rest of the year, more of a high 20% fall through rates than where you quoted.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "I\u2019ll stop that question there, so maybe a different one then. Can you just talk about what your current utilization rates are and given sort of the phenomenal book-to-bill you guys just reported today. At what data point you need to stop adding more capacity on a CapEx basis and increase your OpEx to meet uptick in demand?", "Tom Lynch", "I mean we have been increasing OpEx in our factories in our supply chain, but we\u2019re covering that with productivity. So there is no question that we\u2019re adding more people back to respond to the increase in demand and all the supplies and everything that go with that. So, that is reflected in the current results from a capacity point of view our bricks and mortar we\u2019re planning good, absolute manufacturing capacity, I think we\u2019re fine at the capital investment levels that Terrence talked about in the 4% to 4.5% range. And the most variable part of our capital spending is the tooling that we spend, which is that half of our capital spending related to new program.", "So as we win new program that\u2019s the piece that varies the most. But we don\u2019t -- I would say, we don\u2019t feel pinched on capacity, where there's pinch points and there are still some, that is less than a quarter ago, it\u2019s more the expanded supply chain of material. We are not delivering in some cases the (inaudible) of life tends to be the supply chain more that our fewer manufacturing capacity.", "John Roselli ", "I just want to ask everyone limit their questions to one question and one follow-up, we have a lot of folks in the queue and want to make sure we get to every one.", "Operator", "And next question comes from the line of Amitabh Passi of UBS.", "Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS", "My first question just had to with your expectations for auto. Can you just remind us as you go from September to December, what we should expect in terms of the sequential changes in production? And then I just wanted to confirm as we look at from 2010 to 2012, do you still think to 64 million production number in terms of units for 2010 and 73 for 2012 is still, what you\u2019re sort of planning for or your estimates right now?", "Terrence Curtin", "Amitabh, it\u2019s Terrence, let me take that. Where we have been is, if you look at quarter one and quarter two, car production including light vehicles that we put in [hours] was around 17.5 million vehicles built on the plan in the past two quarters. We do see a slight sequential down tick into the June quarter down to around 17 million vehicles and then we do expect to get into what is typical automotive seasonality down about 5% in production in quarter four. And as a mentioned on the call, we view that this protocol is when we\u2019ll get hooked completely back again with production is our expectation now.", "For the year that equates to those numbers, equate to about $68 million build level and current use of next year is more around low 70s, 71 million is where we see it. So it is coming back faster than where we talked before. Yeah, we certainly, I have said 73 which was the \u201908 level more like a 12, it looks like we could be getting it earlier in 12 from a production perspective.", "Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS", "Got it. And then just one follow-up, I'm just trying to get to the midpoint of your EPS guidance for next quarter. One is, you can give some commentary around OpEx and then the fact that you're going to exhaust the full $40 million in your share buyback plan.  Should we assume share count down 6 million, 7 million sequentially, would there be some offset there?", "Terrence Curtin", "When you look at our guidance, I think the right way to think about from what Tom, and I mentioned is, we did benefit from a lower tax rate this quarter versus the next quarter\u2019s guidance which is about $0.2 difference. SG&A that I talked about going down will add about a penny or two and then the volume benefit really offsets the gross margin coming down a little bit. That's really how you get to the midpoint of our guidance. From a share count perspective just how it works, it will come down little bit probably not to the full amount that you mentioned just due to how the accounting guys make the average. But we are anticipating to use right now the rest of your authorizations through the end of the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin of Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Matt Sheerin - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Question regarding the gross margin, sounds like it\u2019s somewhat capped at 32% still pretty high, we\u2019re just trying to figure the components that go into in terms of leverage going forward, and inline with that, could you talk about materials pricing, copper and other cost that maybe headwinds going forward. And then also the ASP environment in terms of your pricing to customers given that demand is good, are you able to keep prices firm or even increase prices in some cases?", "Tom Lynch", "Let me, if I forgot one of those, remind me. If you start with the where the gross margin level is, as Terrence pointed out, a few benefits, one related to execution, one related to business mix in the quarter, but the 31% we feel very good about. We have a wide range of businesses and products all related around connectivity and 31% is pretty healthier margins. And think about 31% for the balance of this year, I mean we don\u2019t feel we\u2019re limited 31 or 32 necessarily, but we got to take one step at time to improve them.", "In terms of headwinds, baked into our second half is some slight copper headwinds, copper at 335 is slightly higher than what it costs us in the first half of the year where we benefited from fixed purchases we made, but fundamentally the combination of our productive programs and what I would call selective price increases, because on this business really every business close that we have an opportunity to bid on, you have to factor in really we want to be in price. But having said that, pricing has been pretty stable all year, I haven\u2019t seen really much of a material change. We\u2019re looking even where copper is at some selective increasing in the second half to offset that.", "Matt Sheerin - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Then just as a follow-up, just looking at your guidance for the year, it looks like you\u2019re expecting revenue to sort of flatten up a little bit here. Tom, could you just give us a take on where you see demand playing out, because obviously you\u2019re benefiting and other suppliers are benefiting somewhat from this inventory to restocking that\u2019s been going on and it\u2019s been hit consumer in auto first and now we\u2019re seeing in the industrial markets. So there\u2019s some lag there, but what\u2019s your sense of that whole inventory restocking replenishment. When do you think that starts to end and when do you start to grow more inline with your OEM and EMS customers?", "Tom Lynch", "The big one for us of course is automotive, that\u2019s by far the biggest piece of our business that affected by that and we see that getting inline next quarter. What you really start to look at where production and the industry, the industry right now is calling as Terrence mentioned about 68 million vehicles produced around the world and about 68 million sold around the world in our fiscal year 2010.", "So we had less inventory related replenishment benefit in Q2 and that pretty much is done by Q3. We have a little dip in automotive in Q4, but that\u2019s the model changeover for lot of the company. So that\u2019s the typical seasonality. If you look at the rest of our consumer businesses, consumer electronics, handset were important to relatively small. I think in PC, largely through that cycle already and industrial wasn\u2019t much of that to begin with and again smaller pieces of market in automotive, but there wasn\u2019t so much, so I\u2019d say, it largely behind of them.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citi.", "Jim Suva - Citi", "My first question and then the follow-up, I\u2019ll tell you the same time too, but the first question has to do with the outlook of sales, which is $3 billion to $3.1 billion has higher than the reported $2.6 billion this quarter. The EPS guidance is you posted $0.64, but you\u2019re guiding $0.61 to $0.65. I understand maybe a penny of tax, but it just seems like you have more sales, you have restructuring doing traction. Why wouldn't the guidance of EPS to be higher? Is there some conservatism built in there or kind of what disconnect between higher sales and not higher EPS?", "Then the follow-up question has to do with the Undersea business. I think like it's been several quarters in a row discussions bidding on projects and I'm just wondering is this more of funding issues that the different entities are having to fund some of these contracts or there\u2019s just a little bit of uncertainty in the demand environment has causing the economic reasons to call some of these companies not to build out some more, or we just kind of had a structural lower level that we should think about here or potentially there\u2019s a buildup of additional contracts that should really help at some point in the future?  Thank you.", "Terrence Curtin", "Let me take your outlook question and then I\u2019ll ask Tom to talk about Sub Comm. When you look at it sequentially, the tax impact having a 23% tax rate, which we had a quarter 2 to the 26 is actually a $0.02 differential Jim. So when you look at that that is an element that is a drag.", "The other element that we had that we talked about was the Subsea over earning from a gross margin what it did on the rates, so with the gross margin coming from 32 to 31 that is about $0.04 negative. Offsetting those negatives, when you think about it is the volume impact that you talk about, which would have offsets the gross margin slight down draft and then the other benefit we have is SG&A coming down by $15 million, which is a couple of cents. So when you look at those, there\u2019s two negatives, gross margin coming down, tax going up slightly and then the positives are the volumes as well as the SG&A benefit that we talk will also be coming down. Tom will talk about Sub Comm.", "Tom Lynch", "On Sub Comm, as you know we came off with a couple of really big years $1 billion plus years, which had several two really large contract, one over a $0.5 billion and one over $300 million. There continues to be a fair amount of activity, I think there are some that are taking longer because of funding. I think we\u2019re confident that eventually happen that the projects tend to be more in the $100 million to $200 million range.", "I think in a sense the wildcard is the visibility out beyond six months. I mean we know what our backlog is, but typically the way the business works as the folks are deciding to build a network, while they\u2019re in that process of deciding and gathering their funding in their business plan that is very little bit visibility around that for their competitive reasons.", "Once they decide, they want to go forward that\u2019s when they pull companies like ourselves and to give them a bit on how to do it. So these are big major strategic investments, we don\u2019t typically have year or two year visibility to a pipeline. We tend to see it when our folks have decided. They\u2019re going to do something for sure and then they start to bidding process with us.", "If you go back over the last three years, I think generally there\u2019s been more activity than we have expected. Again due to the visibility and I think we all know that\u2019s really due to sort of the data anytime, anywhere and data rich transmissions, more video, YouTube, et cetera. So our focus is to make sure we have the right balance of capacity and that we can capitalize on most of the upside and that we ensure in the event of significant downside. We\u2019re still profitable and better than cost of capital and that model has been working pretty well for us for the last four years.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research; please go ahead.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "First question just ask to deal with the revised against sales range for the 15% EBIT margin. If you could talk to maybe what's change versus one to two quarters ago, where you\u2019re looking at $14 billion to $15 billion in terms of maybe what's more profitable or maybe how the mix of businesses changed a little bit, I think you\u2019ve told into target on the lower sales level?", "Terrence Curtin", "I think the main thing is the execution is happening. We were confident that we would get through things like the restructuring, but when you\u2019re taking that much off line and moving in someplace also it\u2019s a bit of risk, a clean up of the portfolio has certainly been a major contributor. I think we\u2019re better at pricing from values than we were towards the years ago and we\u2019re getting the leverage in the Electronic Components segment.", "I think if I\u2019d have to pick one thing, the business is there really done an excellent job of getting the cost out and as the business comes back and the revenue ramps managing extremely effectively through productivity that these groups have been working on for a three years now. We\u2019re much more protective than we were. So I think that\u2019s the combination of those things, but I had to say hey, which exceeded your expectation Shawn, and most if it\u2019s the productivity we\u2019re getting in the day-to-day running of the business. That contributes most of that point improvement, the 13 and 12 that\u2019s now given up the confidence to talk about 15 and 14.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Then just to be follow-up question is your different global automotive sales run rate you\u2019re looking to get to that $14 billion and then my follow-up question is just on the later cycle businesses, the specialty products and network solutions. Just maybe if you could characterizing what you\u2019re seeing over the next six months and kind of what inning you believe you\u2019re in, in terms of the recovery there? Thanks.", "Tom Lynch", "Shawn, we talked about a different automotive run rate, I assume in the different growth rates in the region.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Either growth rates of the region have a global production number, I think previously that 15% EBIT margin target you are using kind of a mid 70s global production number?", "Tom Lynch", "I\u2018d say it\u2019s still in that 73, 74 million unit range. So that\u2019s a little bit, that\u2019s a little bit better, I mean that\u2019s happening faster as Terrence said and plus our operating leverages is a little bit better in that business then where we start we would be six months ago, so that\u2019s a combination and then we\u2019re doing extremely well in the emerging markets and automotive and there\u2019s nice leverage there as well.", "In terms of the late cycle businesses, I\u2019m not counting on anything extraordinary, but accounting on them getting back to a growth our profile in second half of the year that\u2019s 10% second half versus first half and then getting into their portion of the recovery for SPGA network, but I would say that what\u2019s really given up the confidence to go between $14 billion and $15 billion revenue say it\u2019s going to be around $14 billion, as we\u2019re getting the productivity and we\u2019re especially getting it in Electronic Components.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Brian White of Ticonderoga.", "Brian White - Ticonderoga", "I\u2019m wondering, if you talk about a little bit about the trends that you\u2019re seeing by geography and specifically for auto?", "Tom Lynch", "Sure, I would say starting with Asia, as we alluded to this incredible growth in China, two weeks ago I\u2019ve visited one of the local Chinese OEMs in a small town of 3.5 million people, four hours from Shanghai and 12 years ago they were starting their business and now they are. If they were producing in the U.S. that be number three. So its happening the infrastructure is being built quickly over there that drive, that four hour drive was on a six-lane divided highway, so it\u2019s moving quickly and people want to own cars.", "Japan not as a consuming country for say, but as a manufacturer of mobiles, is picking up again, so the experts are picking up as well as pent up demand in Japan. So Asia as a whole is really solid up 25% solid double-digit growth for us right now. Europe has been solid growth for us and I think we expect that especially Europe and U.S. to go more into the seasonal slowdown in Q4, but I think you\u2019ve heard the numbers recently as companies like Todd, where sales were strong, and most folks are attributing it so there is it. People are feeling better and there is pent up demand, so I\u2019d say, we fell things are going to start leveling off around this 17 million for the next couple of quarters, but that\u2019s a pretty robust level compared to where we thought would be six months ago.", "Terrence Curtin", "Brian, to give you may be to add to what Tom said, if you look at the 68 million vehicles we quoted, that\u2019s up about 20% versus \u201809 and certainly Asia overall is up almost 30% in that, but China certainly out earning Japan and Korea. Certainly, we have the rebound in North America from our production, we see North America production to be up 30% this year, and then EMEA is up low double-digits it\u2019s around 12% from a production levels, just sort of pitch into some of the numbers.", "Brian White - Ticonderoga", "If we look at this recovery, so they started restocking, there were some incentives, people thought auto sales will drop off after the incentives they haven\u2019t. Do you believe the auto market has entered a new cycle and how would you compare this cycle versus other cycles?", "Tom Lynch", "Well, I wish I knew. I hope they are, but I think it\u2019s still too early to tell. I would say, the indicators are positive that you wouldn\u2019t be unrealistic to think about a normal growth profile next year for vehicle production and for our business in relation to that, but we don\u2019t have any unique view beyond the next two quarters.", "Terrence Curtin", "Yes Brian, there\u2019s been no cycle like this in the automotive industry history, so typically and then we talked about it before. The auto typically gets to pre-recessionary bills. We talked that about four years after. So we never had anything as deep as what we went through last year. So certainly every thing that we\u2019re seeing does feel quicker, but to Tom\u2019s point there\u2019s never been a cycle where we seen, what we went through last year, but it is trending quicker based upon what we see in the short-term. ", "Tom Lynch", "We also didn\u2019t have China, like we do today and we also didn\u2019t have to move to hybrid electric automobiles probably", "Terrence Curtin", "To that point, I think if you get away from what do we think the numbers are going to be in the next year is hard to call, we love the fundamental. I mean we love the fundamental that half the world have been driving for a few years really and electronics is going to continue proliferate and you look at these cards that have been made by the Chinese OEMs.", "I mean they are not low content cars, they are not European car content average, but content moving up, people like features and they decided to buy a car they typically want a several of the features then you lay in on top of that hybrid vehicle, electric vehicle, electronic content goes up, that benefits us. So we think the fundamental in the business are really, really good overtime and of course they\u2019re good right now as we\u2019re in the recovery page. ", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of William Stein, Credit Suisse; please go ahead.", "William Stein - Credit Suisse", "Guys, I\u2019m wondering if you can talk inventory a little bit. It was up about 6% in dollars and six days in the quarter. Can you give us an idea for what we should expect going forward, and also can you quantify the impact on our profitability in the quarter from the inventory built?", "Tom Lynch", "When you look at, the impact on the quarter was nil, I mean, we\u2019ll just take that first. Secondly when you look at it, we have been saying that, as the business came back and as we wanted to make sure we were serving our customer, we would be getting back into that. As you model it, I think you have to model about where that from a metric perspective, certainly I\u2019ll move with volumes we do expected to say and where is that right now.", "William Stein - Credit Suisse", "One more, if I can on the restructuring side, it sounds like you\u2019re talking about new charges coming in that might not have been formally announced as kind of a new restructuring program to have that right, and can you give us an idea for how big this one is going to be and what the impact on kind of standalone basis excluding the leverage?", "Terrence Curtin", "If we love anybody without impression, we loved you with a wrong impression. I would say just the opposite. Last year, as I think we told everybody was the peak of the restructuring it\u2019s comedown, and we executed that plan a little ahead of plan, so we\u2019re getting close so where think we need to be given where the outlook of the businesses that\u2019s always going to be fine-tuning in the business like this. I think about this well passed the peak of restructuring and no big new restructuring programs to be announced.", "Tom Lynch", "What I\u2019ve mentioned during the call is consistent with what we\u2019ve been talking about us the part of the major program volumes down, there\u2019s nothing new\u2026", "William Stein - Credit Suisse", "So the charge that\u2019s going to happen next quarter and I think there\u2019s a little bit more in Q4 that you imply that just holdover from stuff that\u2019s already been announced, is that right?", "Tom Lynch", "Correct.", "John Roselli", "As we show (inaudible) we will take one more question.", "Operator", "Okay. And the final question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach of Goldman Sachs.", "Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs", "Nice to see the buyback activity, a lot of other companies have been slow to do that, but what does that say just about the M&A environment and potential pipeline out there and how should we think about capital allocation going forward?", "Tom Lynch ", "I think sure the way to think about our capital allocation is the dividend first, at least to say the debt level first, but that's behind us. The dividend first, strategic moves to strengthen the company and not that we are ruling anything out, but as we\u2019ve said often I believe that for the right opportunities we\u2019d like to do that in networks in our specialty products business. And then to the extent that those opportunities don't present themselves or they don't percent themselves on a timely basis. We would return capital to shareholders.", "We have about 440 million left on the current buyback and so as Terrence said, absent anything that we\u2019ll take priority over that, you can expect that to happen over the balance of the year. But clearly, we have been spending a lot more focus over the last year building the pipeline for two years before that, no question on priority was to get the business focused and the structure very sound, so that we could grow faster organically. I am very encouraged about the organic opportunities in the company. And I mentioned one big one I mentioned in China automotive, but we fell there's a number of allowance there that remains our top priority. But with the cash level we have we're clearly looking at opportunities in our pipeline. I think we would also be fair to say that we\u2019ll probably going to be around the current cash level, we wouldn't build that much more.  So that in conjunction with 440 less on the buyback authorization from last year.  How I would model at [inaudible] for now.", "Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs", "Okay.  And then on the follow-up, the strength you're seeing in the industrial market is that really just the broad macro recovery is there anything specific to Tyco from a design win perspective that's driving some of that strength as well?", "Tom Lynch", "I think it's more, it's definitely more strength in the market and any particular design win I mean we\u2019re having success there, but that\u2019s the very fragmented business.  So that's very customized its not a business were you introduced a platform and you'll get hundreds and millions of dollars of revenue from it, it tends to be kind of the one of customized business and its coming back as people are buying capital equipment again.  So that's the big driver.", "Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs", "Got it, thank you.", "Tom Lynch", "Thank you very much. Thanks everyone for calling in. And we\u2019ll talk to you soon.", "Terrence Curtin", "Thank you.  Thanks, everyone.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you.

Morgan", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to Tyco Electronics Reports Strong Fiscal Third Quarter Results and Raises Outlook for Fourth Quarter Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. John Roselli. Please go ahead.", "John Roselli", "Thanks, Ruth and good morning. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Tyco Electronics third quarter results for fiscal year 2010 and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. With me today is our Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch and our Chief Financial Officer, Terrence Curtin.", "During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask you to look at today\u2019s press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary statements that we\u2019ve included there. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning and we ask you to read through the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that addressed the use of these items. The press release and all related tables along with the slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at tycoelectronics.com.", "Now, let me turn the call over to Tom for some opening comments.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. If you would please turn to Slide 3 now, as we previewed last week, Q3 was another strong quarter for us. Sales of $3.1 billion were at the high end of our guidance as stronger demand offset the negative impact of a weaker euro. Our adjusted EPS of $0.70 was up 9% sequentially and exceeded our guidance of $0.61 to $0.65. This earnings strength was due to slightly higher volumes and related strong fall-through, continued productivity improvements, and operating expense leverage.", "One of the highlights for us in the quarter was our adjusted operating margin reached 15% for the first time since separation three years ago. And while our normal operating margin run rate is closer to 14% to 14.5% at this volume level, this is another indicator of the fundamental improvement in our operating leverage, which you know has been a very, very high priority over the last couple of years.", "Our three largest segments showed continued margin improvement and in our network solutions segment, adjusted operating margins were up 260 basis points sequentially to 13.3%. That business had been lagging on the sale side, turned down \u2013 after the consumer business was turned down, turned up after them and we expect to see nice operating leverage there with volume pickup.", "Order input was solid again this quarter with total orders of just under $3.3 billion and a book-to-bill of 1.06 and this was our fourth consecutive quarter of book-to-bill exceeding 1 and the orders were strong and consistent throughout the quarter and continued that way so far in July.", "If you could please turn to Slide 4. On a sequential basis, orders grew 7% in the quarter. Our electronic components segment orders were up 2%, the industrial and data communication equipment markets in electronic components were up 14% due to increased demand and factory automation in broadband equipment. We did start to see this at the end of the last quarter and expected the growth rate to pick up in these two areas.", "Automotive orders were approximately $1 billion in the quarter, which was down slightly versus Q2 due to currency translation. Excluding that, our organic growth was about 2%. But the book-to-bill was positive at 1.01. Compared to where we were a quarter ago, automotive was a little stronger than we thought. The vehicle production was approximately 18 million units in the quarter, which was essentially flat versus Q2 and as I said, a little bit better than, I think, anybody in the industry expected.", "We are also benefiting from more favorable vehicle mix, that is more premium segment sales. When the market turned down hard over a year ago in addition to the end \u2013 the sharp drop-off in cars itself, the correction in the value to the inventory chain, we also saw slight shift in mix to lower-end cars with lower content.", "I think everyone was concerned about how long that was going to last. We've actually started to see that shift back. So not only is the mix swinging back to a more normal mix which means that in the last couple of quarters more premium cars being sold, but we are also seeing the level of options per car creep up so that our average content per vehicle, which is in the $60, $61 range, is just about back to where it was in early '08 before the hard downturn came.", "Based on current projections, we do see \u2013 expect fourth quarter auto production to be down by approximately 10% with most of this decline in Europe and China. And when you consider the positive trends I just mentioned, net that against the normal volume decline, our sales will be down about 5%.", "Shifting to our network solutions segment, orders were up 11% sequentially and we are starting to see an increase in capital spending by our carrier and enterprise customers over and above the normal seasonal lift we see in this quarter. Orders in these businesses was \u2013 were up 19% and 9%, respectively with strength in all regions. Orders in our energy business were up 6%. I would say that the activity we are seeing was in line with what we expected in the quarter. Noteworthy in our specialty products businesses is that our touch business orders were up 7%.", "In the SubCom business, bookings were approximately $130 million as the Tata Gulf contract did come into force. In addition, we have been awarded portions of two other significant projects worth about $300 million to us and about $500 million to $600 million in total, which we are in the process of obtaining funding. We expect both of those projects to be added to backlog by the end of the calendar year.", "On a geographic basis, orders \u2013 organic orders grew sequentially in all regions. If you take SubCom out, the Americas were up 13%, Europe up 4%, and Asia up 6%. And clearly, our European businesses are benefiting from sales to customers that export a large portion of their products to other regions, particularly in the automotive and industrial equipment markets. And for example, in Germany, I think about two-thirds of all cars produced are exported.", "Before I turn it over to Terrence to go into more detail, let me just recap what we said about the ADC acquisition that we announced last week. The combination of ADC and our network solutions businesses creates a world leader in broadband connectivity solutions for carriers and enterprises. We get excited about this. Here is a few highlights.", "We \u2013 together, we are going to offer the most complete range of carrier fiber and copper connectivity products, all the way from the central office of the data center to the desk or the home. So it's a very robust product offering for carriers. We will also have a complete range of enterprise connectivity products including fiber, copper, wireless, shielded and unshielded cable, and physical layer management solutions. So this really helps us bulk up in our other enterprise product lines for all regions of the world.", "We've added the distributed antenna system or mini wire \u2013 mini cellular antenna and amplifier product line from ADC, which serves the needs of carriers and enterprises as they add wireless coverage and capacity in support of the incredibly rapidly expanding wireless broadband services. And this is really important, because they were the products that we did not have and this would have been a gap in our offering.", "We said we would be a leader in every region and we believe this is going to increase our opportunities and we are going to be much stronger through all the channels, not only our direct channel, the ability where we are going into customers direct, but through the electrical distributors, as well as telecom distributors. We have more to offer together to these companies. So I think our relationships will become more strategic.", "We will have the scale to meet the ever-increasing customer needs around the globe. The networks have \u2013 tend to have different designs around the world. There is commonality to a level in the platform, but there is also local differences and the ability to have the engineering resources in the labs and on the ground to do this is important.", "And lastly, in addition to the strategic benefits of this deal, we expect to realize significant cost synergies, which we currently estimate at about $100 million annually. We expect the acquisition to be accretive in earnings in year one by approximately $0.14 and earn company average margins in year three. So in a nutshell, we want to be a leader in connectivity and the broadband networks buildout and this acquisition gives us the opportunity for that.", "So with that, I'll turn it over to Terrence.", "Terrence Curtin", "Thanks, Tom and good morning, everyone. Let me start by reviewing our sales performance by segment and market. And then I'll get into earnings and cash flow.", "You start with Slide 5. This shows our overall revenue performance by segment both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. As you can see, we had both year-over-year and sequential sales growth in all segments, excluding SubCom. Total company sales of just under $3.1 billion were up 23% year-over-year. The growth was driven primarily by our electronic components segment, which was up 46% with growth across all markets. Excluding SubCom, sales growth was broad-based across all regions, with Asia up 47%, the Americas up 32%, and Europe up 23%.", "Currency translation on a year-on-year basis decreased overall company growth by approximately 70 basis points. Looking at sales growth on a sequential basis, sales were up 4%, led by network solutions with growth of 12% and also nice growth in the electronic components and specialty products segments, offset by a decline in SubCom.", "Currency played a bigger part on the sequential basis than year-over-year. Currency translation decreased our overall company growth on a sequential basis by approximately 310 basis points. If you look at the mix of our business, our businesses that serve the consumer markets which is slightly less than half of our revenue, sales increased 43% year-over-year and 2% sequentially.", "As we highlighted on last quarter's call, in the industrial and infrastructure markets, we continue to see improvement in them and our sales were up 9% versus last year and 6% sequentially. If you take out our SubCom segment, the industrial and infrastructure markets were up 13% on an organic basis.", "Now, let me get into more detail by submarket by our segments and unless otherwise indicated, all changes that I'll talk to would be on an organic basis. So if you turn to Slide 6 and on the left-hand side, starting with our components segment market, in the automotive market, our sales versus the prior year increased 47% and sequential sales were up 5% with growth in all regions. Year-over-year growth, we saw sales were up 60% both in Asia and the Americas, while Europe was up 36%. As Tom indicated, we expect our quarter four sales to be down in automotive approximately 5% related to normal seasonal patterns.", "In the DataComm market, which includes sales to the communications equipment, service, and storage markets, our sales increased 37% year-over-year and were up 14% sequentially, driven by new customer program launches and continued spending on broadband infrastructure and data storage equipment.", "In the industrial equipment area, sales were up 65% versus the prior year and 12% sequentially, driven by the increased capital spending and factory automation, which is also driving additional demand in the distribution channel.", "In the appliance market, our sales were up 51% on a year-over-year basis and 9% sequentially, driven by end demand and increased content. In the computer market, our sales increased 32% versus the prior year and 10% sequentially, driven by the growth in the emerging markets, as well as demand for Notebook and Netbook products.", "And finally, in the consumer device markets, which includes sales to the mobile phone and consumer electronic markets, our sales were up 10% year-over-year and up slightly sequentially.", "Turning to the right-hand side of the slide to discuss network solutions, sales in the segment were up 8% versus the prior year. Sequentially, our sales were up 17%, which is much higher than the typical seasonal growth of 5% to 7% we see in these markets due to increased capital spending by our customers. Based upon the trends we are seeing, we expect revenue levels in all the businesses to remain strong and to be similar to the Q3 levels in quarter four.", "If you look at the energy market, our sales were up 4% versus the prior year and up 12% sequentially due to increased demand especially in Europe and typical seasonality. In the service provider market, our sales were up 7% versus the prior year and up 29% sequentially due to increased carrier spending in all regions of the world, especially in Europe. And in the enterprise network market, our sales increased 16% versus the prior year and were up 12% sequentially, reflecting continued investment in the data center, government, and education markets.", "Let's turn to Slide 7 to cover our specialty products and SubCom. Sales in the specialty products segment increased 17% versus the prior year and were up 10% sequentially. Sales to the aerospace, defense, and marine market were up 8% versus the prior year and up 9% sequentially due to the improvement in the commercial aerospace market, as well as strength in the distribution channel. We currently expect for quarter four revenues to be similar to the quarter three levels.", "In our touch systems business, sales were up 31% versus the prior year and 16% sequentially. Sales to the retail market continued to improve during the quarter and for our \u2013 in our fourth quarter, we expect a further increase of 10% versus our quarter three levels, driven by continued improvement in this market.", "In the circuit protection business \u2013 and this business primarily serves consumer markets, our sales increased 39% versus the prior year and had a 10% sequential growth and this is driven by growth in portable devices. And finally, in our medical products business, sales increased 5% versus the prior year and 2% sequentially, driven by improved spending on capital equipment.", "Looking at the right-hand side of the chart, in our SubCom segment, as expected, our sales declined 47% versus the prior year and 18% sequentially. Bookings in the quarter were $137 million and we ended the quarter with $583 million of backlog. We expect revenue of approximately $150 million in quarter four, which will result in full-year sales of approximately $725 million and with the awards that Tom talked about, our current view of 2011 sales remains in the range of $600 million to $700 million and certainly if we are able to land more awards, there \u2013 that amount would go up as we move through the year.", "Now, let me get in and discuss our earnings which start on Slide 8. Our GAAP operating income for the quarter was $467 million, which includes $4 million of income related to other items net of restructuring charges. There were no additional manufacturing site closures in the quarter and our current site total remains approximately 90. We expect approximately $15 million of restructuring charges in the fourth quarter and expect that upon program completion in 2011, our site count will be in the mid-80s. Currently we expect that the charges in 2011 will be $50 million.", "Adjusted operating income was $463 million in the quarter with an adjusted operating margin of 15%. Solid fall-through of approximately 40% on the $130 million of incremental sales drove the sequential improvement. The operating leverage we are getting is a result of the prior cost actions and ongoing productivity programs, as well as the benefit of the pickup in our industrial and infrastructure businesses.", "In addition, similar to last quarter, total company margin did benefit from favorable project execution in the SubCom segment, which positively affected overall margin by approximately 50 basis points. And what this is, is really the closedown of some larger contracts and our team executing very well from a cost element to bring them in better than originally estimated. Based upon this and the guidance \u2013 top line guidance given for quarter four, we expect adjusted operating margins of 14% plus with our SubCom margins being in the low-teens.", "Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.70 and this was up 9% from the second quarter, reflecting the growth in the operating income of 13% and this was offset partially by a slightly higher tax rate.", "So let's move to Slide 9 now. And if you look at top-half of the slide, our gross margin in the quarter was 32% and this was consistent with last quarter and slightly higher than we guided. As I mentioned earlier, we did get favorable project execution in SubCom, as well as all of the segments with a slightly higher volume came in with slightly higher operating margin with good fall-through. As volumes increase in our industrial and infrastructure market, we do get a slight mix benefit and in quarter four, we do expect gross margins in the 31.5% to 32% range.", "If you look at the bottom-half of the slide on operating expenses \u2013 and these include both RD&E and SG&A, they were up $62 million year-on-year, driven by the increase in sales. On a sequential basis, the operating expenses were down approximately 160 basis points due to additional leverage on the increase in sales, as well as approximately 30 basis points of currency benefits related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro. In quarter four, we expect that our research, development, and engineering will continue to be approximately 5% of sales and that SG&A will be approximately 12.5% of sales.", "Turning to Slide 10, let me discuss items on the P&L below the operating line. Net interest expense was $34 million versus $38 million in the prior year and that was due to lower debt levels. Adjusted other income, which relates to our tax-sharing agreement, was $9 million compared to $5 million in the prior year and for quarter four, I expect this will be approximately $13 million of income.", "A GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was 30% and the tax rate on adjusted income was 27%. This adjusted tax rate was slightly higher than our guidance rate of 26% and had a negative effect of $0.01 per share. In quarter four, we expect the tax rate on adjusted income of approximately 26% and we expect we will be able to continue to keep it that at level beyond 2010 based upon the planning we completed.", "Now, let me talk to cash flow that's on Slide 11. Our free cash flow in quarter three was $283 million compared to $327 million in the prior-year quarter. Higher income levels in the current year were partially offset by slightly higher capital spending and increases in working capital as volumes have picked up. Our adjusted cash tax rate was 6% in the quarter and continues to be lower than our normal rate of 20% as we utilize net operating losses incurred in the prior year in certain international locations. We expect that our full-year cash tax rate will be slightly below 10%.", "Turning to our working capital metrics, we continue to have good performance as business conditions improve. Our day sales outstanding of 65 days were up one day versus the prior year and up three days sequentially and our inventory days on hand, excluding contracts in progress, of 63 days was down four days year-over-year and was flat sequentially. As I mentioned previously, we expect to be able to maintain the inventory days at this level moving forward.", "We spent $92 million on capital in quarter three or approximately 3% of sales, up from prior-year levels of $61 million. We expect capital spending in the fourth quarter to be approximately 4% of sales and for the full year, we expect capital expenditures to be about $375 million.", "Cash restructuring during the quarter was $30 million and we expect about $40 million in the fourth quarter. With this, we expect the full-year cash restructuring spending of slightly below $200 million.", "And finally, as Tom mentioned, based upon the traction we are seeing, we have increased our guidance for full year 2010 free cash flow to be $1.3 billion versus the $1.2 billion we mentioned last quarter, and this does include the restructuring spending I just mentioned.", "Moving to Slide 12, which shows our debt and liquidity position, we began and ended the quarter with about $1.8 billion of cash. The free cash flow of $283 million we generated this quarter was essentially returned to our shareholders via dividends of $72 million and share repurchases of approximately 8 million shares. At the end of quarter three, approximately $200 million remained on the current share repurchase authorization and we expect to continue our share repurchases in the fourth quarter, albeit at slightly slower pace than what we did this quarter.", "Finally, as we covered on the ADC acquisition call last week, the $1.25 billion enterprise value offered is an all-cash offer that we expect to fund with approximately $1 billion from available cash and the remainder from debt. This will allow us to keep our strong credit metrics while retaining flexibility, continue to take advantage of any strategic opportunities while continuing to return cash to our shareholders.", "Now, let me turn it back to Tom.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks, Terrence. I'll give a quick update on our fourth quarter outlook and our full year and add a few comments on how we see the economy. If you want to turn to Slide 13, please?", "For the fourth quarter, we expect our sales to be in the range of $3.05 billion to $3.15 billion, which is up 13% to 17% year-over-year and about flat sequentially. Continued strength in industrial and infrastructure markets will offset the normal seasonal decline in automotive and the expected decline in our SubCom business.", "Adjusted operating income is expected to be in a range of $430 million to $460 million compared to $463 million in Q3 and we would accept, as Terrence mentioned earlier, that the Q4 operating margin should be 14% plus. We feel that we've pretty solidly hit that level now and we expect all segments, excluding SubCom, to have margins similar to the third quarter levels.", "Our adjusted \u2013 our Q4 adjusted EPS are expected to now be in the range of $0.68 to $0.72. For the full year, sales are expected to be approximately $12 billion, up 17% versus the prior year and full year EPS are expected to be in the range of $2.49 to $2.53 compared to $0.81 last year.", "Now, when we were sitting here a quarter ago \u2013 we want to compare how we see the second half then versus now. Our organic revenues improved about $200 million, 3% to 4% roughly, offset by about $100 million of euro headwind due to the weaker euro, and our EPS is up about 15% due to that volume increase and stronger margin. So the business is definitely stronger, feeling stronger than when we sat here a quarter ago.", "Just a few comments looking beyond the fourth quarter. Visibility is somewhat limited because most of our businesses have relatively short lead times as you know and there are \u2013 there is a lot of mixed signals in \u2013 on the global economy which are definitely creating uncertainty. But on a positive note, conditions in the majority of the markets we serve are much better today than they were a year ago, primarily because inventory levels in the supply chain are much lower. And in several industries, our customers are telling them they are still low, even though there is uncertainty in the demand versus the second quarter.", "In addition, we are seeing capital spending relating to infrastructure starting to pick up, especially in the broadband, commercial vehicle, and factory automation areas. Another sign is that distribution channel inventories are pretty healthy. Our business has been consistently strong, we expect that to level off, but the inventory in the channel is healthy.", "Now, we know that things can change quickly. But what I am confident about is that we have momentum in most of our markets, which means we are performing well in most of our markets and we have a much better cost structure in place. It's giving us good operating leverage on the upside as you are seeing this year with gross margins, two quarters in a row at 32%, the ability to hit albeit with a few benefits of 15% operating margins in Q3. And what that also means that in the event we don't \u2013 we are not \u2013 we are seeing \u2013 we are shadowing this, but if there were some kind of downside, we are much better protected on the downside.", "So to wrap it up, it was another strong quarter and we raised our outlook for the fourth quarter. Cash flow continues to be strong and we expect to generate approximately $1.3 billion, which is $1 billion more than we thought three months ago when we sat down here.", "During the quarter, we returned $280 million to shareholders, we announced the important acquisition of ADC to establish world leadership position in our network businesses and we are very excited about that and the integration is well underway already. And we are going to continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with the flexibility to pursue strategic options and to continue to return cash to shareholders, which has been our strategy really from day one to be balanced in that regard and we will continue to be that way.", "So thank you. And with that, operator, can we open the line up for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Yes, thank you. (Operator Instructions). And the first question does come from the line of Amitabh Passi with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS", "Hi, thank you. Tom, first question for you. Can you just remind us what normal seasonality tends to be for you in the December quarter?", "Terrence Curtin", "In December quarter \u2013 Amitabh, it's Terrence. Typically what we do see is auto production typically comes down a little bit because of taking advantage in certain parts of the world some of the holidays and you also get some of the seasonal outside businesses typically come down a little bit versus a quarter two or quarter three. But typically, it's pretty consistent with our quarter four levels on a normal basis.", "Tom Lynch", "And I would say it's a little \u2013 probably a little bit less this year, because of the catch-up mode that some of the industries are in. For example, some Tier 1s and some OEMs are having a shorter shutdown period this year than normal.", "Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS", "Got it. And then just very quickly, your guidance, let's say 14% plus, 14%, 14.5% operating margin, still at $12 billion sort of revenue run rate, it seems at this level once you get to sort of the $15 billion, you will be well north of 16%. I mean, is that the right way to think about your model or do you think \u2013 you probably see some incremental cost pressures as you go into fiscal '11?", "Tom Lynch", "I would say that's a question we expected. Thanks for asking it early. Actually we feel good that we are solidly and sustainably in the mid-14 range at this level, which gives us a lot of confidence when we talked last quarter that to be able to deliver 15% plus at the $14 billion level is \u2013 we are right on track \u2013 we are ahead of that plan.", "Internally, we would expect if we keep this momentum, the possibility of going over that, but I think it's too early to tell. We want to deliver some sustainability. As you know, the mix can shift in this business, exchange rates and things like that. So that's why we say, hey, we are \u2013 we feel with this 14%, 14.5% sustainable level, that \u2013 when you get a little more revenue on that and the flow through we've been getting, that's what lifts us up to the 15%, 15% plus sustainable level. So we are not capping it by any means, but we want to achieve it and achieve it consistently before we move up the target externally.", "Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS", "Great. One final question and I'll step back in the queue. Gross margins 2Q to 3Q were down 50 basis points, both quarters had about a 50 basis point benefit from Subsea. I'm just trying to understand some of the dynamics. Was there sort of headwinds from currency? Can you just maybe elaborate on that?", "Terrence Curtin", "When you look at it, actually that gross margin that you saw there had to do with \u2013 we did talk about last quarter some mix benefits around the distribution channel last quarter on the top. So we did expect \u2013 when we guided, we guided basically down. We thought we would be around 31.5. The margin came in right where we expected ex SubCom. So we had some mix benefit in our components segment in our second quarter that didn't repeat here this quarter. But that was the entire driver.", "Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS", "Okay. Thank you.", "Tom Lynch", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Next, we go to the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC. Please go ahead.", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC", "Yes. Thanks a lot, guys. Maybe \u2013 if I could just maybe push you a little bit more on that longer-term question, historically you have talked about being 25% plus incremental margins. If you can do that from current levels, that would imply you could get to 16.5%, 17% operating margins on that $14.5 billion run rate. What would be the offsets or caveats to achieving that?", "Terrence Curtin", "What I would say, Amit, we are not coming off that operating leverage number. So when you see that, it really comes into \u2013 that has not changed and it's the sustainable level, we do feel we are at this 14% plus and then what is the growth trajectory off of that. So really that \u2013 that's the big item that is what is the growth trajectory off it to get to the 14.5%. We \u2013 as we said, we do expect we will be able to get 15% plus at the $14 billion level.", "Tom Lynch", "And I would add in business mixes.", "Terrence Curtin", "Exactly.", "Tom Lynch", "I would say we had \u2013 in the recovery of this year, we have all the benefits that you typically have in a recovery and a little bit more than we would have expected in favorable mix in the channel. Now, part of our strength is to grow our share in the channel and I think early indications are we are making progress there.", "So we are very confident about the path we are on, but it's just too early I think to say, hey, put another $1.5 billion when we are at 16% to 16.5% given the mix of the business we have. I mean, we could conclude to aggressively go after other elements of the business that might have lower operating margins, but \u2013 for example, with very high returns. I'm not suggesting that that's the kind of tradeoff and that's why we want to give ourselves that flexibility, but the good news is I think our track record is showing the margin is consistently moving up.", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC", "Fair enough. So as long as the mix is static relatively speaking, the sales growth is there, nothing really inhibits the 25% incremental margins, right? I mean, is that a reasonable takeaway?", "Tom Lynch", "It's a reasonable takeaway.", "Terrence Curtin", "That is the right takeaway.", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC", "All right. And then just one more thing. Your auto business, it kind of looks interesting to me because sequentially units were basically flat and on a constant currency basis, you guys actually saw a 5% sequential growth. How much of that 5% growth do you think was content growth versus maybe mix helping you?", "Tom Lynch", "I would say it's a combination of both. We definitely saw in the latter part of last quarter and through this quarter that in the mix shifts aren\u2019t wild, but they clearly moved back to the higher end what we would call the premium vehicles. That picked up again and our content, for example, can range from a sort of a subcompact car of $45 a share up to a premium car that has as much as $300 of content.", "So a shift can move us a little bit. So it's that and more options. We are seeing really everywhere we go \u2013 I was in Latin America and Brazil about a month ago and introducing requirements for stability control systems, so that adds a less cyclical content. And we are seeing more options and the OEMs naturally, now that things have settled down, are pushing more options in their deals. So we are seeing that lift right now. But it's more \u2013", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC", "Fair enough. And then just finally, I just wanted to revisit question, which is on the buyback. Could you maybe talk about how much you expect it to slow given the fact we are going to have the ADC transaction closed by end of the calendar year?", "Terrence Curtin", "Well, we won't get into the exact amount. But what we will do is make sure as we do have this big expense coming up, we will ease it back a little bit from that viewpoint, but we will still continue to do it. And we only have about $200 million left on our authorization anyway on that. So we don't give an exact number, but we do expect to be lower than this quarter.", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC", "All right. Fair enough. Thanks a lot and congratulations on the quarter, guys.", "Terrence Curtin", "Thank you, Amit.", "Tom Lynch", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And next, we go to the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.", "Matt Sheerin \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Yes, thanks. Just a follow-up on the automotive sector, specifically on the order patterns and inventory. You had a few very, very strong, obviously better than seasonal quarters. Now, you are back to seasonality. Could you give us a \u2013 some color on how the inventory at your customers look right now in terms of component inventory and do you expect that at some point there would be some sort of correction as the customers figure out exactly where they are in terms of inventory?", "Tom Lynch", "Correction is a big word, I would say. We had a big correction 18 months ago that lasted for two quarters. We don't see anything like that, because I think we have all learned \u2013 we have \u2013 we still have customers expediting us and there is still a general shortage of certain components in the automotive industry.", "So we are not \u2013 whether it's an OEM and inventory on the lots in most countries, not everybody report that the ones that do are down. I think the U.S. is in 45-day range, which is below normal levels, let alone below where it was last year. Tier 1s are not having anywhere near the level of some of the shutdowns as they did even last year, when this thing was starting to ramp at this time, because they are still trying to catch up.", "So our chats with our Tier 1 partners, the harness makers, the OEMs, their inventories are in very good shape. So if you had a flattening, I don't think you would have much of an adjustment at all. If you had a slight downturn beyond seasonal, I think you would have a small adjustment. So that's what I said earlier in the call, I think things are in much, much better shape. Everybody frankly erred on the side of having too little inventory, which is why there is still a lot of noise in the supply chain and we get our share of that.", "Matt Sheerin \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, great. And then could you comment on the pricing environment, not just in auto, but across your components businesses? As you said, there are component shortages, there is a lot of expedited orders. So that would obviously put you at somewhat of an advantage. So could you talk about what you are seeing on ASPs right now and how that trends going forward?", "Tom Lynch", "I don't \u2013 I think with that typically \u2013 the impact of that typically means there is less price erosion and \u2013 but we continue to be in the 1.5% to 2% range hasn't changed in a couple of years now. But we actually haven\u2019t much of a change in any of the industries out of normal pattern. I would say again a little bit lighter, because when there is a shortage, folks aren\u2019t coming in and pressuring you as much as they normally would. But I also think \u2013 no, I can speak for us. We've gotten a lot more effective in our pricing as we've retooled our pricing processes over the last two or three years.", "So we feel like we \u2013 we are \u2013 have a much better handle on the global pricing trends and how to make sure we are pricing at the right level or not, leaving too much on the table so to speak. So we consistently see under 2%, we do not expect that to change much for the next couple of quarters. And beyond that, it's really hard to tell. Copper has come back again from where it was a quarter ago, back to $3 I think. A quarter ago we were around $3.50. So in general, pretty \u2013 not much volatility in pricing right now.", "Matt Sheerin \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, thank you.", "Tom Lynch", "You are welcome.", "John Roselli", "I want to just remind everyone to just hold your questions to one question and one follow-up. We've got a lot of folks in the queue. We want to try to get to everyone here in the next 20 minutes or so. Thank you.", "Operator", "And next, we go to the line of Craig Hettenbach with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Craig Hettenbach \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Yes, thank you. Tom, you mentioned that order trends were consistent throughout the June quarter and that strength continued into July. Can you talk about by end market, are you seeing much fluctuation in terms of certain end markets trending stronger or weaker?", "Tom Lynch", "I wouldn't say fluctuation, Craig. I would \u2013 what I would say is, to really plot it out in detail, the non-auto consumer market flattening, just a little bit of a decline, which we do think if there is one industry that the consumer electronics industry probably suffered most from the dearth of supply components and so there is probably a little bit of an overbuild built in supply, but it's not significant.", "So we are talking about supplying points on the graph here. I would say the industrial market and infrastructure market orders continued to get stronger through the quarter and automotive was fairly \u2013 was very stable through the quarter across the regions. So it's been three or four months now and sort of running at the $3.2 billion, $3.3 billion quarter order rate without much variability. And the SubCom business has its own variability, but I'm excluding that.", "Craig Hettenbach \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thank you. And then just on the follow-up, I know it's only been a week since you announced the acquisition. But any initial feedback from customers on the ADCT?", "Tom Lynch", "Yes, I would say very, very positive \u2013 very positive from our direct OEM customers. They had all been telling us they want larger strategic suppliers that \u2013 so like so many companies are doing, we want less suppliers and we want the ones we have to do more that have more scale, that can give them better value and better investment in technology.", "And our channel partners are really excited about the idea, because this kind of consolidation simplified their life. It gives us more \u2013 we are valuable strategically to a big channel partner than we were as two separate companies and it's really \u2013 I think it really is going to be the one and one equals three through the channel as well. We have to work it out and all those things and it will take a couple quarters to get momentum around that. But those are the kind of things we are working on right away.", "Craig Hettenbach \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thanks, again.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks, Craig.", "Operator", "And next, we go to the line of Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.", "Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research", "Hi, just a quick clarification first. In terms of the seasonality question on auto, what is the typical seasonality for the December quarter?", "Terrence Curtin", "Typically what you \u2013 typically what you'll see and even if you look at the projection for 2011. So we basically would say the December quarter \u2013 we said are going to have about 16 million, 16.5 million units being built here in quarter four. Right now, the projections are about 17 million to 17.5 million units going from Q4 to Q1. But typically, that is a lower quarter than the stronger quarters of quarter two and quarter three, Shawn. So hopefully, that helps frame it.", "Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research", "Okay. And then just two brief questions. You mentioned during the prepared remarks you are seeing, I guess, restocking in different parts of the supply chain. Maybe you could just describe where you think you are at in terms of just the timeline of that being completed and then within the specialty products business, EBIT margins at almost 17%, is there upside from there because you have very good profitability right now?", "Tom Lynch", "When I say restocking, I don't feel like it's a programmatic type of thing where businesses are, \"let's get the shelves filled.\" I think it's just that when things went so hard and they went down that literally everybody in the supply chain, if they didn't have to buy anything, they didn't. And much of the supply chain \u2013 even our suppliers and we are \u2013 we are fairly \u2013 take auto, we are fairly far down the supply chain. The folks who supplied us turned off, it took them a while to get up. That took us a while to come back.", "So I think it's just getting a regular flow of components and getting normal lead, getting back there the kind of normal lead times you need to live with. So in automotive, when OEMs are releasing orders once a week and the harness makers have to have enough inventory to meet all those difference custom harnesses and deliver them to their customer within a week, we have to have enough connectivity products to do the same.", "So I think what we are just \u2013 I'd say it's getting back in equilibrium, not so much a stock-up. But as we check around and you can imagine we check around twice as much as we did, given what happened last time. We are feeling that it's pretty healthy. We don't think there is any business lift to speak of that's going to come from it. It's more a \u2013 like there is a pause here or a little downturn, everybody is going to be in pretty good shape to handle it. So it's not going to have to be a slamming the brakes. There will be much more of a gradually applying of the brakes. But we are even not seeing signs of that yet.", "So for all the uncertainty in the macro side of things, you talk to OEMs, you talk to Tier 1s, you talk to our sales people, we are getting a pretty consistent message. But we know it can change quickly.", "Terrence Curtin", "And then on your SPG comment, Shawn, the SPG segment, we do expect we will be above the 16%. And if you actually go back in '08, it ran 17%, 18%. And what we are seeing \u2013 it really comes to the point what Tom and I made during the prepared remarks. These are much more industrial markets typically, better gross margins and I think what you saw this past quarter \u2013 we expect the margin to be similar in our quarter four. And as volume comes, these are markets that we do think will be in a \u2013 the higher-teens versus where they were last year and the lower to middle. So I do think as volume continues to ramp, we do have some more upside in that area.", "Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research", "Okay. Thank you very much and congrats on the quarter.", "Terrence Curtin", "Thank you, Tom.", "Operator", "Next, we go to the line of Steven Fox with CLSA. Please go ahead.", "Steven Fox \u2013 CLSA", "Hi, good morning. Just a question on the industrial markets. Could you talk a little bit about any signs you could point to as to the sustainability of the demand? Obviously, it's come off of lows and was a laggard as the economies around the world have recovered. But why would we be comfortable that, say, a year from now, we are still talking about decent growth in industrial?", "Tom Lynch", "I think the biggest trend that's going on \u2013 and this is what \u2013 I don't think we have \u2013 we sure don't have any unique insight into the sustainability, but we can apply our own company strategy. The reliance on lots of low-cost labor in China, it \u2013 you can't rely on it for the long term.", "So everybody we talked to including ourselves have key programs that begin to add more automation into the \u2013 into that their China operations. And you know us, we produce almost $2 billion worth of revenue in China, we got 30,000 plus employees in China. The supply demand of labor in China continues to be on the favor of the \u2013 there is more demand than supply, which leads to turnover. The costs are going up, all the things you would expect as the country goes from the emerging to early development. So we are seeing our industrial customers' business pick up as many, many companies are changing their model.", "And then the other factor is just the growth of \u2013 the buying power of the Chinese consumer is growing significantly. So local consumption is growing, which \u2013 and that will be served largely by local production. So I think those are two big drivers. I wouldn't say they are long \u2013 I think they are long-term sustainability, I'm sure they'll have peak and valleys as the economy goes. But that's what we see being the single biggest driver.", "And secondarily, I think everybody trying to guard productivity. You come out of a period where so many companies had to take so much cost out and most of that cost was people, that we are all being very careful how we bring it back in, one, to manage the financial performance of the company and two, reduce the volatility in our workforce. And one of the ways you bridge that gap is different levels of automation. So it's beyond China, but the \u2013 if you have to say one big \u2013 one single big trend, it's automation in China.", "Steven Fox \u2013 CLSA", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Tom Lynch", "Welcome.", "Terrence Curtin", "Thanks, Steve.", "Operator", "Next, we go to the line of William Stein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "William Stein \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thanks. Good morning. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about lead times now and when we see the book-to-bill ex SubCom of 1.08. Do we think about that as a backlog building into calendar Q4 or is that more near-term demand that it's reflecting?", "Tom Lynch", "I would say our lead time probably the last two quarters were a little \u2013 I would put in a two-weeks-longer-than-normal category or down to the week-longer-than-normal category. So that gap is improving, our production comes up. I think that certainly we have orders scheduled for the first fiscal quarter of our year. But the real indicator is the order rate that's coming in the door short term, because we know that these orders can be put on hold. I mean, we had a healthy order backlog 18 months ago and got quickly put on hold. We are not seeing any signs of that.", "So \u2013 the key is with the flow rate in the front door so to speak as opposed to what's the size of the backlog, because typically if people are getting nervous, they start to turn down the amount of orders they are releasing. And as I said, that hasn't really \u2013 in any of our markets I would say, hasn't tapered much. We look for lots of signs, constantly digging for signs and as I mentioned in an earlier question, other than consumer electronics which is leveled off just a tiny little bit of a tick-down and it's \u2013 we can't even conclude anything from it, because there is so much mix within there. We haven\u2019t seen anything like that.", "William Stein \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thanks, Tom. And then just one follow-up, if I can. There has been a change in distribution strategy or an evolution of distribution strategy at Tyco over the last, I don't know, a few quarters. I'm wondering if we can get an update on that, where we are in the process of maybe cutting the number of distributors, focusing more products through distribution and comment on maybe any effect that's having on revenue growth and margins.", "Tom Lynch", "Very well. That's been a \u2013 as you know, that's been a big important focus area for us. I think like a lot of our business in the past, we did too many things and we did it in too many ways and therefore we weren\u2019t effective and we spread ourselves too thin. So whether it's the portfolio or the footprint, I would put our distribution \u2013 our historical distribution strategy in that category.", "So what we decided to do was to have less distributors, more strategic distributors and really have strategic relationships with them. So that program has been underway for two years. The number of distributors now has been cut in about half. We've recently been around to all of our big key strategic distributors and I would say we have a lot of momentum. People are feeling like this is a win-win situation and we feel very good about it.", "We believe that the beginnings are showing up in our numbers. And it's certainly showing up in terms partner satisfaction, ease of doing business with us, which then turns and we will believe into some market share. So we feel very good about where that program is. Still more work to do.", "William Stein \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Any change in percent of revenue through distribution as a result of this?", "Tom Lynch", "Maybe up a percentage.", "Terrence Curtin", "It's inflated a little bit right now.", "Tom Lynch", "A little bit.", "Terrence Curtin", "But we wouldn't call that market share necessarily. So still the distribution channels outperformed the direct channel due to some restocking and some shift in spending.", "Tom Lynch", "I'd say where we are is we are in the increase in mind share right now, which will follow \u2013 we expect to follow with market share. But all of the indicators are very positive.", "William Stein \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Terrence Curtin", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We go to the line of Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Jim Suva \u2013 Citi", "Thank you and congratulations on great results and very strong outlook. I have a question for Tom and the follow-up is for Terrence. Tom, with the ADC transaction now, you are going to be integrating it, does your companies have bandwidth to do more acquisitions during this time period? You just previously mentioned that in the past your company has kind of been spread kind of thin doing a lots of different things. But should we think about you guys digesting and integrating at first or do you still have some bandwidth to do it? And people continually ask me why it takes you three years to integrate this versus others who integrate much faster such as like an Amphenol.", "And then Terrence, on the follow-up, the other income line of $13 million seems to really move around a lot. Should we expect it to be around that $13 million or kind of go back to the $5 million to $9 million? And on the tax rate, you've been working it down. Are we at the optimal level of around 26% or can you still take tax rate lower? We are talking future quarters out.", "Tom Lynch", "Yes, Tim. Good question. I think a couple of things. Our sense of sort of object [ph] acquisition, $60 million, fairly straightforward, integration in 30 days. ADC, $1.2 billion company operating on every part of the globe, legal entities all over \u2013 how do you optimize factories, how do you optimize the channel. So the integration, it really depends on the definition. So I think us presenting ourselves to the customer, that integration will be done shortly after the deal closes. So our customers will feel one company coming into them very, very quickly.", "Shortly after that, product roadmap, bringing the harmony together and what \u2013 who \u2013 what kinds of products, where do we have overlap, where \u2013 how are we \u2013 who is going to develop what and what lab, what location. That will be defined, I would expect, within three months of integration. Sort of the SG&A, primarily G&A optimization, that will be in the first year. And what takes long is where you might be doing factories and we still have to sort that out. But if there is factory integration, depending on where those factories are, that would take longer.", "So I don't think it sort of all \u2013 it all happens and it takes three years. It's sort of like marching down a football field that you are gaining yards all the way along and making progress all the way along. And when we say \u2013 when we \u2013 those longer-term things around factories, I think you have to keep in mind, this is a billion-dollar business that has complexity to it and we need to be delivered to it. But I do feel we have an excellent team. The early indications is there is great teamwork between two teams.", "The second part of your question for me, do we have the bandwidth to do other acquisitions depends on \u2013 we wouldn't do another acquisition in this phase, of course. But in other areas, in certain parts of the specialty business where we've had \u2013 for example, aerospace and defense or in our network energy where we have things that we would like to bolt on, no. The ability to \u2013 we wouldn't be impacted by that, because it would be different people who are doing the work. And we are going to be deliberate, no question about it.", "It's when really put our network solutions and the telecom piece of that business, it now is a much stronger business than \u2013 we want to be \"a leader\" if not \"the leader\" in the segments we are in, because there is a lot of benefit for the crew. And if you believe that broadband is a long-term trend which we do \u2013 and it's not even broadband as we think of it today. It's much more bandwidth into the home, because when you think of the high-definition, 3D and all those things, that puts us in a good place.", "So Terrence, you want to answer \u2013?", "Terrence Curtin", "Yes, let me answer your tax question, Jim, other income. Other income, I think when you when we guided, I typically mentioned it's going to be between $10 million and $13 million. Certainly the complexity of it is interrelated to our tax-sharing agreement and whatever moves in that number typically also affects the tax rate. When you look at \u2013 so I do think from a modeling perspective, Jim, and $11 million to $13 million is where we should model per quarter. There will be volatility as we settle things out under the tax-sharing agreement.", "When you look at the tax rate, the tax rate, I think we've made tremendous progress. At separation, we were mid-30s, certainly not optimized from a structural perspective and we worked very hard. And as I stated before, we've made progress better than even I expected to get to this 26%. The big pieces have been done. I think there could be some more opportunity, but it will be smaller steps and bigger steps. And I think, as we mentioned before, assuming jurisdictional tax rates stay the same and all the pre-separation stuff settled, I do think we could get into the lower 20s once that occurs. But that's still a few years out.", "Jim Suva \u2013 Citi", "Thank you and congratulations to you and your team.", "Terrence Curtin", "Thanks. Jim.", "John Roselli", "We'll take one last question.", "Operator", "Great. And the final question comes from Steve O'Brien with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.", "Steve O'Brien \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Hi, thanks for fitting me in. On the margin side, this quarter and into the fourth quarter, could you update us on what impact, if any, there was from the raw materials prices? I think in the past, we talked about the hedges rolling off and potentially a $5 million to $10 million headwind there. But clearly, prices have somewhat moderated. Maybe it has not been as big of a hit.", "And then similarly, if you could comment on or help quantify the impact from potentially higher wages? This \u2013 if that's running through the model in the fourth quarter, if there was a headwind in the third quarter?", "Terrence Curtin", "Both of those, Steve, when you look at it, metals, as well as wages, that's not nil effect. Certainly on both of those when you see it in our margin and our margin guidance, any effects of those, we are covering with our core productivity and the fall-through. So it's really \u2013 metals is neutral and the inflation is neutral.", "Steve O'Brien \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "That's right. And if I could on \u2013 just a one quick follow-up, on the plan to finance a portion of the ADC purchase price with some debt, can you just remind us how much cash you'd like to have on the books to run the business and with free cash flow at $300 million a quarter right now, just \u2013 it seems like you could pick up the portion you are planning to finance in just one quarter. So if you could just help us with the rationale of the debt for ADC there, I'd apperceive it.", "Terrence Curtin", "It's actually quite easy. Really, the debt we are putting on ADC is the debt in line with our credit metrics, Steve. So as we look at anything we like, our credit metrics are where they are at today. Certainly when you look at it, anything we will look at will be to \u2013 we will evaluate whether to put that on with those appropriate credit metrics. So I think it's maintaining a balance sheet and the credit metrics that we want, while also balancing returning capital to shareholders, as well as look \u2013 making sure you are flexible for further opportunities.", "On what do we day to day to run the business, day to day, as we've said, it's around $500 million is what we need to run the business. And certainly we've been running with some extra capital for strategic opportunities and we'll still have some flexibility once the deal closes as well. And then the free cash flow, we still believe post-deal, as well as inclusive of ADC, our free cash flow will still continue to approximate our net income. So that model that we've shown is very resilient and will continue into the future.", "Steve O'Brien \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay, thanks.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks, Steve.", "John Roselli", "Okay. Thanks everyone for joining the call this morning. That will wrap up the call today. As always, the IR team will be around for any follow-up questions you may have. Thanks and have a good day.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be made available for replay after 10:30 a.m. today until July 29th at midnight.

(Operator Instructions) As a remainder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to now turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Keith Kolstrom, Senior Director of Investor Relation. Please go ahead. ", "Keith Kolstrom", "", "Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Tyco Electronics fourth quarter results for fiscal year 2010 and our outlook for the first fiscal quarter at full year 2011. With me today are Chief Executive Officer Tom Lynch and Chief Financial Officer Terrence Curtin. During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward looking information. We ask to review the forward looking cautionary statements included in today\u2019s press release. In addition, we will use certain non GAAP measures in our discussion this morning and we ask you to review the section of our press release in the accompanied slide presentation that address the use of these items. ", "The press release and related tables along with the slide presentation can be found on the investor relations portion of our website at te.com. finally, for participants on the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call, I would like to remind everyone to limit themselves to one follow question to make sure we are able to cover all questions during the allotted time. Now let me turn the call over to Tom for some opening comments. ", "Tom Lynch", "", "If you could please turn to slide number three. Q4 was another strong quarter for the company. A revenue of just over $3.1 billion was up 16% year-over-year and was at the high end of our guidance range and our adjusted earnings per share was $0.72 which was up $0.42 versus last year and was also at the high end of our range. Our adjusted operating margins were above 14% again this quarter and I think that\u2019s a clear indication we\u2019ve really strengthened the company\u2019s operating leverage and our consistently delivering about 14% margin at the $12 billion sale level which was an important objective for us. And we are on track to achieve 15% plus operating margin at the $14 billion sales level. ", "Free cash flow was very strong at $443 million in the quarter as a result of increased earnings and continued solid working capital management. So a pretty solid quarter for us in Q4. now, I'll do a quick recap of the full year. We also felt 2010 was the year very good performance for the company. Sales were up, sales were at $12.1 billion, up 18% and adjusted operating margins improved to 13.7% which was up almost 800 basis points from the prior year. we exceeded the target of 12% margin at $12 billion in revenue that we planned the business around during the downturn, about impacting our strategic investments cause I'm sure you recall 18 months ago and the business was pretty difficult, the 12 at 12 scene is what we embarked on in the company and drove through the company and we\u2019re pleased that we\u2019re able to exceed that and now be delivering 14% at 12. ", "The key to achieving that through the improved margin were driven by the strong flow through on the volume growth, the benefits of our restructuring program which is now substantially complete and improved productivity. We also made several moves in the past year to strengthen our strategic position. In July, we announced an agreement to acquire ADC which will significantly enhance our position in the broadband connectivity market. We also made some small technology acquisition through the year to strengthen our position in the data communication and touch markets. We had another year of very strong cash flow generating $1.4 billion, up approximately $180 million versus last year. We returned approximately 60% of this cash to shareholders almost $800 million in the form of dividend and share repurchases. ", "Last month, we announced our board of directors approved the $750 million increase to our share repurchase program and we also planned to request shareholder approval for dividend increase of 12.5% as part of our annual meeting in March. This increase would be effective in June 2011 quarter when approved. So we\u2019re happy with the fourth quarter. I think we finished the year strong, had a year of really good progress in a number of areas and not just for 2010. and now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Terrence who is going to review our Q4 results in more detail. ", "Terrence Curtin", "", "Let me start by reviewing the sales performance and then I\u2019ll get into earnings as well as cash flow. If you could return to slide four please. In the fourth quarter, we had both year-over-year and sequential sales growth in all of our segments excluding sub communications. Total company sales are just over $3.1 billion were up 16% year-over-year with growth primarily driven by the electronic components segment. Excluding the SubCom segment, growth was broad based across all the regions with Asia up 29%, the Americas up 25% and Europe up 16%. Currency translation did decrease our overall growth on a year-on-year basis by approximately 250 basis points. ", "On a sequential basis, sales were up 2%. Solid mid single digit growth and our network solutions and specialty product segments were partially offset by the expected decline in SubCom and lower growth in the component segment primarily due to typical seasonal declines in the auto business. Currency translation benefited overall company growth by approximately 80 basis points on a sequential basis as well as compared to our guidance. The currency translation above our guidance really drove our sales being involved the mid point of our guidance range. Now, let me get in some highlights of key markets in each of our segments and unless otherwise indicated, all changes that I\u2019ll discuss will be on an organic basis. So please turn to slide five. ", "Starting with the component segment on the left side of the slide. In the automotive market, our sales increased 26% versus the prior year and were down 3% sequentially. Year-over-year, sales were up 34% in the Americas, 25% in Europe and 22% in Asia. Sequentially, our sales declined as a result of the expected production declines in Europe and in China. Global vehicle production was in line with expectation at about 17 million units in the quarter and based upon current projections, we expect quarter one auto production expected to remain consistent with the quarter four levels. The increase in production in Europe will be slightly offset by production declines in Japan. Turning to the Datacomm market which includes sales of the communication equipment, server and storage markets, our sales increased 51% year-over-year and were up 9% sequentially, driven by both new customer program launches and continued spending on broadband infrastructure and data storage equipment. ", "In the industrial equipment market, sales were up 56% versus the prior year and 5% sequentially driven by increased capital spending and factory automation particularly in Asia. When you look at the segment overall, we do expect quarter one sales to be similar to quarter four at levels. We expect sequential growth in the automotive market to be offset by declines in Datacomm and the industrial markets due to inventory adjustments and distribution channel that we believe will work through in the first quarter. now turning to our network solution segment on the right side of the slide. Sales in the segment were up 15% versus the prior year and 6% sequentially due to increased capital spending in all of the end markets. ", "Sales in the energy market were up 11% versus the prior year with growth in all regions. Revenues were also up 9% sequentially due to the continued recovery by European utilities and normal seasonality. Sales to the service provider market were up 28% versus the prior year. sales were up 4% on a sequential basis with growth in Asia and the Americas while Europe remained at the strong levels we saw in quarter three. We continue see steady improvement in fiber optic network investment in most regions. And the enterprise networks market, our sales increased 12% versus the prior year and were up 3% sequentially, reflecting growth both in Asia and the Americas. In quarter one, we expected sales in the network segment to be down approximately 5% versus quarter four due to typical weather related seasonality. ", "And turning to slide six to cover specialty products and SubCom. Sales in our specialty products segment increased 18% versus the prior year and 5% sequentially. Sales to the aerospace, defense and marine market were up 16% versus the prior year and up 3% sequentially due primarily to an improved commercial aerospace market. In our touch systems business, sales were up 30% versus the prior year and 10% sequentially driven by additional retail and industrial business applications. In quarter one, we expected segments to be down approximately 5% sequentially primarily due to expected decline in the retail portion of our touch systems business. if you look at the right hand side of the slide, let me cover sub sea communications. ", "As expected, our sales decline 46% versus the prior year and 14% sequential. Booking is the quarter were $37 million and we ended the quarter with $475 million in backlog. As we covered on the last call, we have been awarded two contracts for about $300 million combined which are currently in the process of securing funding and we expect to have them backlog by the end of the calendar year. we expect revenue of approximately $150 million in quarter one and for the full year 2011, sales expectations remained in the range of $600 to 700 million. now let me discuss earnings which showed on slide seven. Our GAAP operating income of the quarter was $382 million which includes a non cash loss of $41 million on the previously disclosed sales of mechatronics business, $14 million of restructuring charges and $8 million of cost related to the pending ADC acquisition. ", "As I\u2019ve discussed in prior quarters, the restructuring program we started in 2007 will be completed in 2011 and in quarter one, we expect approximately $10 million of charges and about $30 million of charges for the full year. Adjusted operating income was $446 million in the quarter and the adjusted margin rate was 14.2%. margins were up 600 basis points versus the prior year due to the volume increases and the operating leverage from the prior cost actions as well as our ongoing productivity programs. Sequentially, margins were down slightly as expected. As I discussed on our last call, margins did benefit in the third quarter by approximately 80 basis points from favorable project execution in the SubCom segment and currency gains. Adjusted earning per share for the quarter was $0.72, up from $0.30 in the fourth quarter last year, reflecting the growth in volumes, a significant improvement in our operating margins driven by our gross margin expansion, a lower effected tax rate and as well as the benefit of share repurchases executed during the year. ", "So let me turn to slide eight to talk about gross margin and operating expenses. Starting at the top half of the slide, our gross margin in the fourth quarter was 31.7%. This improved 600 basis from the prior year gross margin at 25.6% due to the strong operating leverage we achieved on the incremental volumes. Sequentially, gross margin was down slightly due to the Q3 SubCom margin benefit that we did not expect to re-incur in the current quarter. As I covered previously depending on the end market mix and currency rate, we would expect gross margins to remain in the 31 to 32% range at the current sales levels of $3 to 3.2 billion. Looking at the bottom half of the slide, operating expenses were in line with the guidance I gave on the last earnings call of approximately 5% for RD&E and approximately 12.5% for SG&A. ", "Expenses were up $78 million year-on-year, driven by the increase in sales and up versus quarter three due primarily to currency exchange effects. In quarter one, we continued to expect that our RD&E will round about 5% of sales and that our SG&A will remain approximately 12.5% of sales. turning to slide nine, let me cover items on the P&L below the operating line. Net interest expense was $34 million in the quarter compared to $36 million in the prior year. it was slightly higher than we guided but we do expect a similar level for quarter one. Adjusted other income which relates to our tax sharing agreement was $12 million compared to $9 million in the prior year. for quarter one, I expect this will be approximately $14 million of income. The GAAP affected tax rate was 36% in the quarter and the tax rate on an adjusted income basis was 23%.", "The GAAP to tax rate was impacted primarily by a settlement of a pre-separation share tax matter. The impact of this was approximately $0.05 per share. The adjusted tax rate of 23% was slightly lower than our guidance due to the favorable tax and income mix at the end of the year. this had a positive effect of approximately $0.02 per share compared to our guidance level. In quarter one and for the full year 2011, we expect the tax rate on adjusted income of approximately 26%. Now let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet that starts on slide 10. our free cash flow in the fourth quarter was $443 million and this compared to $608 million in the prior year. higher earnings levels in the current year were partially offset by increases in the capital spending and working capital due to the higher volumes. ", "Our free cash flow for the year was a record at $1.4 billion, an accomplishment we\u2019re very proud. Our performance to the last two years continue to show our resiliency of our company\u2019s cash during and certainly some economic turmoil. Our adjusted cash tax rate in the quarter was 20% and we expect a mid teens cash tax rate in 2011. Turning to the working capital metrics, our day sales outstanding of 65 days was down one day versus the prior year and flat sequentially. Our inventory base on had excluding contracts from progress of 63 days was flat sequentially and up four days year-over-year. And as I mentioned previously, we expect to be able to maintain inventory days at this level moving forward. Continuing to discuss working capital, over the past two year, we\u2019ve made significant progress improving in this area. And just to highlight this specifically, we\u2019ve been able to reduce our net primary working capital which is AR plus inventory, less AP as a percentage of sales from 24% in 2008 to the current level where we\u2019ve been running around 20% and we expect to be able to keep it down.", "In capital spending, we had a $136 million in the quarter, approximately 4.3% of sales which was up from the prior year low levels of $58 million. We expect the capital spending for the full year 2011 to be approximately 4.5% of sales or in line with depreciation levels. Cash restructuring in the quarter was $38 million and we expect about $15 million in quarter one. Certainly, now that the restructuring efforts are winding down, we do have a tail from a cash perspective. This cash will wind down as we go through the year and we do expect about $130 million of cash outlay due to the cash restructuring events we previously completed. We expect 2011 free cash flow will be in excess of $1.2 billion including the restructuring spending I just mentioned and in the first quarter, free cash flow will be approximately $100 million as this is typically our lowest quarter of the year. ", "Let\u2019s move to slide 11 which get into the balance sheet and our liquidity. Our cash balance increased $175 million in quarter four and we ended the quarter with about $2 billion of cash. The majority of the remaining free cash flow that we generated in this quarter was used to return a $186 million of capital to our shareholders through the dividend payments of $71 million and the repurchase of approximately four million shares. We did also make a $69 million voluntary pension contribution during the quarter. As Tom mentioned earlier, our board of directors approved an increase to the share repurchase authorization by $750 million and we now have approximately $815 million outstanding on the authorization. Since separation, approximately $1.9 billion have been returned to shareholders due to repurchase and about 61 million shares.", "And we continue to expect share repurchases in 2011 with the near term rate and pace will be affected by the timing of the funding requirements related to the pending ADC acquisition. We expect to use of the $2 billion, about half or a billion dollars for the acquisition of ADC and we\u2019ll find the remainder of the 1.25 purchase price with that. As mentioned on this morning\u2019s press release, we continue to expect that the ADC acquisition will close in the current quarter and as we perform our integration planning, we continue to validate the strategic merits of the deal and we see no changes to the financial guidance that we previously provided. Before I turn it back to Tom, let me cover page 12 which highlights the change in our segment reporting structure.", "Affected with the new fiscal year, we had streamlined our management structure to further alignment of similar businesses. The specialty product segment has been merged with existing businesses and our SubCom business has been aligned wit the infrastructure business and our network solution segments. As a result of these management changes, we will go from four segments to three segments as you can see on the slide and the three segments will be transportation connectivity, communication and industrial solutions and network solutions. When transportation connectivity will include the automotive business from a current component segment and the aerospace defense and marine business from the specialty product segment. Communications and industrial solutions will include the non auto markets of the current component segment and the touch, medical and circuit protection businesses of the specialty product segment. ", "And finally, the network solution segment will include the current network solutions segment and the SubCom segment and will also include ADC once the acquisition is completed. We will provide a recast financial information for the new segments via 8K and we expect to file this by the end of November. Now let me turn it back to Tom.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks Terrence. Why don\u2019t we move to slide 13 which shows an overview of our orders since the fourth quarter of 2009 and I\u2019ll take a little time to describe the trend we\u2019re seeing in the business. In our largest business which is automotive, demand continues to strengthen. The industry is now projecting world wide 74 million units will be produced in our fiscal year 2011 versus 72 million in 2010 and that was recently upped in the last month. World wide production is now back to 2008 levels, well ahead of I think what any of us would have predicted a year ago, driven primarily by growth in the emerging market. And in the two largest markets China and the U.S. we expect the fiscal year 2011 auto production to be up 5% and 4% respectively. ", "Both those markets had huge growth in fiscal year \u201910 with China close to 50% and the U.S. in the high 30\u2019s and we expect that to slow down but to nice healthy level. If you look beyond the one year outlook, we continue to be really very bullish on the long term outlook for this industry as we get around to our customers around the world, it\u2019s clear that the investment and the commitment of hybrid and electric vehicles and building the infrastructures is well underway. So I really believe this is defiantly moved past the if this is going to happen and is now clearly into when this is going to happen and make sure we\u2019re well positioned to take advantage of that transition when it really begins to happen in earnest and as you know when you\u2019re talking a hybrid electric vehicle or a pure electric vehicle, you\u2019re talking a significant increase in our type of content. ", "In our industrial and infrastructure markets which collectively accounts for about 50% of our business, capital investment did begin to strengthen in the second half of the year and we do expect this to continue in fiscal year 2011, the big drivers underlying this are investments and factory automation, broadband infrastructure and energy infrastructure in both the broadband and energy infrastructure side of our business, investment in general have been relatively low the last few years as our customer cut back and we\u2019re now seeing a pick up and we believe that is sustainable. And then in our non consumer, our non automotive rather consumer markets which accounts for about 15% of our business and includes market such as PCs, mobile devices and consumer electronics, demand has improved from last year but this one hasn\u2019t recovered as much as we would have expected and I'd say, we\u2019re a little less certain about the rate of growth although we do, we would that this will pick up probably in our fiscal second or third quarter of 2011. ", "Let me turn now to slide 14. Now based on the trends I just described, the following is our guidance for the first quarter in the full year. For the first quarter, we expect our sales to be in the $3.05 to 3.15 billion range, essentially flat with Q4 and up organically by about 10% over last year\u2019s first quarter. The year-over-year increases is broad based across all of our markets offset by the decline in SubCom which we have been fore shadowing for a while. Our Q1 earning per share or adjusted earnings per share are expected to be $0.66 to 0.70, up about 45% from the prior year first quarter and down just slightly versus the quarter we just completed, our fourth quarter of fiscal year \u201910 where we generated $0.72. If you take the mid point of the Q1 guidance, $0.02 of the sequential decline is due to taxes and Terrence mentioned that and $0.02 is due to the lower expected volumes and distribution. And the way to think about this quarter is in essence we expect Q1 sales and adjusted EPS to be roughly at the same level of Q3 and Q4 of fiscal year 2010. ", "So the business has settled in at a nice solid $3 to 3.1 billion revenue level. For the full year, we expect sales to be in the range of $12.8 to 13.2 billion which is up 6 to 9% versus fiscal 2010 and remember fiscal 2011 includes a 53rd week which will occur in the fourth quarter. This additional week adds approximately 200 basis points or $240 million to the year-over-year growth. You take that out and look at it on our purely 52 week to 52 week comparison. We are expecting organic growth to be in the 4 to 7% range and sales to be in the $12.6 to 13 billion range. The key assumption underlying this full year production are that are auto production around the world will be at approximately 74 million vehicles, up above 3% but our SubCom business revenue as we mentioned earlier was going to be in the range of $6 to 700 million. this is down from $720 million our fiscal year \u201910 and for the remainder of our businesses, we continue to expect them to be driven by nice growth in the emerging markets and relatively low growth by historical comparisons in the U.S. and Europe. ", "This all translate into a full year adjusted earnings per share that we expect to be in the range of $2.85 to 3.05 on a 53 week basis compared to $2.54 in 2010 and this would be an increase of 12 to 20%. And again on a 52 week comparison, we have more of an apples to apples EPS would be up 10 to 18% on our organic growth of 4 to 7%. And this guidance assumes current foreign exchange rate and commodity prices. So before we open it up for Q&A, just a quick summary of all that. We thought 2010 was a good year for the company. As you know, the actions we began several years ago and accelerated during the down turn enabled us to significantly improve operating leverage that was really our number priority and we\u2019re now consistently generating 14% operating margins at the $12 billion sales level. And I think an important point to note is we\u2019re able to generate returns per share this year of 254 that was equivalent to the pre-crisis 2008 level when our sales were $14.4 billion. So the net of all that is we feel like we\u2019re operating at a much more flexible way.", "We\u2019re also gained strength in many of our end markets by continuing to invest aggressively and engineering during the downturn. We now have about 7000 plus engineers around the globe, close to our customers designing products. We feel that\u2019s our real strength of our company. And in this past year, we did make some strategic acquisitions. One of them, the big one ADC which we talked about earlier but we also made several smaller acquisition and the technology area of fiber optics connectivity, high speed data communications and touch systems which strengthened our portfolio product and technologies in those areas and we believe really all high growth technology driven areas which is where we want to focus any M&A that we do. And of course, we continue to strengthen the balance sheet during the year and we returned almost $800 million capital to shareholders. So all-in-all a good year consciously optimistic as we enter fiscal year \u201911 and now let\u2019s open it up to questions. ", "Question and Answer Session", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions). One moment please for the first question. ", "Tom Lynch", "Operator? No questions coming?", "Operator", "", "All right. Our first question is going to come from Matt Sheerin. Please go ahead. ", "Matt Sheerin ", "", "Yes, thanks and good morning, everyone. So my first question has to do with your guidance for fiscal '11. It looks like you're looking for EPS to grow at about 2X or more than sales given that there's potential headwinds on the margins, gross margin side with rising material cost, where's the leverage in the model on the operating margin side and below the margin line?", "Tom Lynch", "Nice questions. It\u2019s in both but it\u2019s primarily in the operating margins side. So if you take a 4 to 7% organic growth rate that and we\u2019ve been consistently dropping flow through on revenue of 25 to 30% in that range. So that\u2019s the significant contributor. We would expect in our planning for our operating margins and our gross margins to continue to improve through out the significant contributor. We\u2019re still getting the benefits of the restructuring that we\u2019ve done as well as productivity programs which we believe will largely offset in conjunction with selective pricing the current head winds in that commodity. And then of course, we get some leverage from the cash flow and some lower shares. Terrence you want to?", "Terrence Curtin", "Yes. Just right now, I think Tom explained up in the operating margin there. Below the operating margin right now, from a tax perspective, its pretty neutral year-on-year with the 26% I guided to. So that\u2019s not there and there is some benefit of both the share purchases we\u2019ve done last year to Tom\u2019s point and as I\u2019ve said on the call, we will continue with the excess capital we generated. There\u2019s nothing strategic to do it. So there will be some benefit but it\u2019s primarily through the operating margin expansion. ", "Matt Sheerin", "Okay. And the operating margin, that's going to come from both some improvements in gross margin and then leverage off the expense line, right?", "Terrence Curtin", "Yes. It will be improvement in the gross margin and it will also be as we certainly the quarter one guidance is similar to quarter four. We will leverage the SG&A as go and the revenue increases similar to the model that we told you about previously now. RD&E we still expect to be around 5% of sales. ", "Matt Sheerin", "Okay, thanks. And then just for my follow-up, you talked about a correction in distribution in the industrial market and in DataCom. Could you elaborate? It sounds like you're looking for just a one quarter correction. What kind of visibility do you have there?", "Tom Lynch", "Matt, you\u2019re correct. We do see it as a one quarter correction I think. With a strong rebound in the push out of lead time and folks scrambling for parts in a lot of industry last year, the multiple sources of components, de-stock inventory but the good news was I don\u2019t think in anything that anything got really out of hand. It just had a little bit of a more growth than I think in the channel than any of us kind of would have liked. So, we see that as a one quarter adjustment relatively minor but definitely there\u2019s a little more as we do our channel check and work very closely with our partners. Others are a little more in the channel than I think we both deals as optimum. ", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Amitabh Passi. Please go ahead. ", "Amitabh Passi", "", "Thank you. Tom, I'm just curious, why go ahead and put out a full year guidance this early? Just if you could elaborate what you're seeing, what gives you sort of the confidence and the conviction that you can do the 4% to 7% growth? I would love to hear just a little more in terms of your thought process.", "Tom Lynch", "Sure. Yes. Especially after the last couple of years right? Several things. When we look at our last two quarters and the current quarter we\u2019re in, the outlook quarter, we really do see demand pretty broad based stabilizing at the $3 to 3.1 billion level. When we talk to our customer, what are they planning and of course, all these things can change as we know but a pretty consistent thing across customer is about what they\u2019re expecting for the point that I have more confidence that we\u2019d have in a long time but clearly, its still uncertain and when we translate into with the business is going to look like, we felt we had a much stronger like depend on and certainly in the prior six quarter to talk about a year out. ", "And that\u2019s why we wanted to be clear with the big assumption. Automotive at 74 million units is not a big stretch from 72 where it is at now. You could argue there\u2019s some conservatism in some of those regions and there might be found aggressiveness and other could unbalance that. That looks like a reasonable number to us. If you go to back to last three year in the infrastructure business, there really wasn\u2019t I mean, there was everybody did about as bare minimum as they could, investing in infrastructure in terms of energy and telecom. So we see a lot of activity around the world whether it be fiber or the X sold out or just upgrading the grid, certainly alternative energy has a lot of momentum behind it. And then, probably the most uncertain is our consumer side but that\u2019s only 15% of the business. ", "But when we take all that in, it seem the better thing to do is to give a full year guidance with a pretty clear set of assumption and we\u2019ll update it every quarter but I'd say we feel it\u2019s pretty balanced right now. ", "Amitabh Passi", "Okay. And then just for my follow-up, you mentioned fiber to the X activity around the world. Could you just update us what you're seeing in the pipeline? And I'm also interested in knowing if there's any update on the Australia NBN project. We've seen a couple of system vendor announcements, Alcatel-Lucent and Nokia-Siemens. So I'm just wondering when you think the passive infrastructure vendors are announced and how you think you're positioned?", "Tom Lynch", "Yes. I know. I think that there is a lot of activity. NDN is probably one of the ones that\u2019s getting the most which is the big build out in Australia. Latest information we got is sometime, maybe this quarter, early next quarter decisions will be made on who\u2019s going to be awarded it. We feel good about we\u2019re going to have that sizeable participation in that. In Europe, we\u2019re seeing activity pick up for sure across several of the major telecom operators and it\u2019s reflected in our order rates and our business the last couple of quarters. And I think we had a nice product range before the ADC acquisition and once that closes, I think we\u2019re going to have an excellent product range through out the entire network on cyber connectivity as well as copper. ", "And while copper is a mature piece of it, its still an important part of the network but we\u2019re really excited about the cyber product range that we can bring to our customer literally from beginning to end of the network and customers increasingly are looking for that to simplify their lives. But we\u2019re bullish on broadband. That\u2019s why we did the ADC deal and we wanted to be the leader in broadband connectivity and the past decide. And we feel it\u2019s going to be really good for us.", "Terrence Curtin", "Just to add to Tom. On NDN, just on the progress, we would expect pretty little revenue in \u201911 based upon the work calendar. So for our share that we would hope to get, we probably won't kick in until more into \u201912. ", "Operator", "", "Question comes from Amit Daryanani. Please go ahead. ", "Amit Daryanani", "", "Just a couple of questions, first off, with your orders being down around 9% and I guess it's down 6% ex the undersea business, can you just talk about what gives you the comfort to guide revenues flat when orders are doing down?", "Tom Lynch", "Sure. Couple of things. Orders were really robust in Q3. So that backlog has it going away. I think you take the distribution side where there\u2019 adjustment going on, the way that adjustments taking care of is orders are being reduced. So if you look that one chart, I forget which one it is, it shows the book to bill over the course of the year. The book-to-bill was very positive which meant backlog bill. We\u2019re still in 0.99 and historically, this business over in the normal cycle is going to run a little more than one. Then if you take our most recent completed months that we\u2019re in, the order rate definitely supporting. It\u2019s a positive book-to-bill. So it\u2019s affording the revenue level that we\u2019ve guided to in Q1. ", "So we have a lot of data points there that gives us confidence. ", "Amit Daryanani", "Got it. And just back on the commodity headwinds, can you just talk about if there's any change in your hedging strategy as you go forward? And is there some explicit assumption you have in terms of commodity headwind that you saw in September and the December quarter guidance you're providing? ", "Terrence Curtin", "Yes. Amit, is serious. When you look at it certainly, our risk management process, I've been doing that for many years that has not changed. So we do fix but with gold and copper outnumber numerous months. Typically, the first six months going out. Last quarter, we did have about $10 million of extra costs due to metal net of our hedging program. So that was included in there but when you look at it, next year, we assume current market rates with our hedging program and that is a headwind that we do have growth in next year as part of our guidance. And we have like Tom said, both through pricing and our productivity programs, we feel we can mend. ", "Amit Daryanani", "Got it. And then just finally for me you guys are changing the segments right now. If I remember this I think right at the start of the recession you guys decided to split the specialty products and essentially the take was you were going to focus aggressively to drive better growth on it. And you're just kind of merging that segment into two other segments. What's the mandate to focus on it not successful or not as successful as you thought it was driving you to merge it into other segments now?", "Tom Lynch", "Yes. If you go back little over two years ago, when we were receiving of that specialty product segment, our top priority there was really to sort through the product pruning that was going on components segment of the divesture or the divesture activities, we had a clean up quite a bit of the portfolio and the restructuring activity was just coming in the full swing. We felt that taken these short smaller business that was kind of worrying that maybe we weren\u2019t getting enough attention with all that going on and putting them into a separate segment. I would help us focus on the bigger challenges in the company while at the same time, not loose focus on those four. ", "I think that was successful for us but as we went through the last round of strategic planning process and is very much one of the key focus areas and how do we leverage across our business and define opportunities to grow faster and how do we find more synergy in the company, it was pretty clear that the time had frankly, the specialty products sweeper service purpose that there was a lot of commonality in some of the products and some of the environments in both aerospace, defense and marine and automotive harsh environment, high end relay to go into aircraft, same products go in the an electric vehicle and lets get the synergies and those products and then our other businesses. ", "The really device and equipment connectivity puts them back into the re-organized communications business, communications and consumer business. And that\u2019s why we did it. I think the other point I'd make is we have three segments. Under there, we have about 20 businesses. And those businesses, sort of the integrity of those businesses has been intact pretty much since separation. There\u2019s a medical business, its really how we talk about the business. In Terrence section, there\u2019s a solar business, there\u2019s a general manager, there\u2019s a team that owns that P&L and at this point in time, these three segments we feel is the best way to aggregate and get the most out the synergy of having those businesses together. So it\u2019s actually a pretty much of non event in the company to change it around as I'm slugging the business and slugging it over here to learn any management changes or things like that. ", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Steven Fox. Please go ahead. ", "Steven Fox", "", "Hi, good morning. A couple questions, just first of all, just to be clear on raw materials, can you just quantify the impact a little bit better in the quarter on what you're thinking is a potential drag as you go into next couple quarters given where copper, gold and plastic prices are?", "Tom Lynch", "Quarter four that was just ended, it was about $10 million of increased cost sequentially and we do expect an additional $10 million going from quarter one. Before impacts of pricing and productivity, we take all our hedging and it\u2019s about a $50 to 60 million headwind in 2011 versus 2010. ", "Steven Fox", "Okay. And then when you look at just your global trends and what you're outlining, your sales into Europe I would imagine are benefiting from some export demand out of that region. Is it possible to quantify how much that's contributing to growth? Is it more than normal? Is it a big factor? Any color on that would be helpful.", "Tom Lynch", "Its mainly auto and then industrial equipment and large portion in particularly of the cars made in Germany are going to China and the U.S. China is specially consuming a significant portion of the high end cars of the German manufacturers. So they clearly the biggest impact for us in auto, the secondary impact is a lot of company ourselves included increasing plans to automate what is historically been very labor intensive operations in China and Japan and Germany really I think most consider them the world leaders in its kind of automation. So there\u2019s definitely a lot of export in that segment too. ", "So we\u2019re here to say take a snapshot about business in Europe. The export piece is very strong. The non export piece is a little tepid, no surprise given with the GDP is over there.", "Steven Fox", "And is it fair to say you expect that to continue? Is it baked into your full year outlook?", "Tom Lynch", "Yes. We do expect that to continue. ", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach. Please go ahead. ", "Craig Hettenbach\u00a0", "", "Yes, just Tom, following up on the comment on select price increases, given that the industry is now coming back into better balance and is not as tight, do you think there can be any resistance to that from your customers?", "Tom Lynch", "Definitely. I think there\u2019s always resistance. And that\u2019s why we say it\u2019s a lack. You really can break it down into sort of three types of our businesses. Our infrastructure business which tends to be large projects you negotiate a big project and you have established pricing for several years. And so, you tend to be locked into that. then there\u2019s anything that goes through the channel where we have the opportunity to periodically, typically once a year maybe sometimes twice a year adjust prices and I\u2019d say that\u2019s where you have the highest success rate and then the rest of the business which is the project in \u201910 that you\u2019re working with the OEM\u2019s out there. ", "They are putting out 50 more projects to bid and your bidding on them and really just have to be competitive and that\u2019s where you work on each one of those to optimize your price which often takes the form of a smaller productivity commitment that you give to the customer meaning they\u2019re asking for certain price down every year and we come in and point out, hey, here\u2019s what\u2019s going on with gold and copper and we try t get that price reduction to be a little less. Its operating on different fronts with the way I would say that I think that we would expect customers to as supply-demand continues to give back more balance to be a little more aggressive on price. But that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been used to operating in and that\u2019s why we do things like significant reduction in the foot print, rolling out lean with 2000 and now trained lean practitioners about the company to make sure that we have consistent fundamental productivity improvement across the board cause in electronics, you live in world of price erosion. ", "Craig Hettenbach", "", "Okay, and in autos you mention high-end German car export for China. Looking out over the next 9 to 12 months, based on just current design pipeline and production plans for your customers, how would you describe just changes in mix within automotive, in terms of dollar content implications? ", "Tom Lynch", "I would say that we\u2019re hearing from our customers what they\u2019re telling us to be prepared to do, we do not see a significant change in mix. It takes a really significant change in mix to move our content off the $62 to 63. So we do not have in this for sure, in this one year outlook or guidance, we don\u2019t have any change in mix of any substance to take in. ", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Shawn Harrison, Longbow Research. Please go ahead. ", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Just regarding the channel, now that you're seeing some, I guess [sell-in] pressure could you maybe describe the sell-through environment? Have you seen any adjusting for seasonality change in terms of product sales going through the channel?", "Tom Lynch", "No. I'd say so though its been pretty stabilized or stable which is encouraging. So we haven\u2019t met the number that\u2019s with our partners. We work very closely cause that\u2019s always a clear indicator of how to sell through the moves. Is there something going on? So sell through is moved, is pretty solid right now. Sell in was a little higher than sell through last quarter. Maybe a little bit at the end of the first quarter. Not drastically higher. We\u2019re thinking that it is a kind of a $15 million adjustment on our sale grow in a quarter going forward. So we\u2019re not looking at anything massive but its enough to notice. ", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "I guess, too, then I mean, lead times seem to be part of the factor here. Do you think your lead times kind of across the board are back to maybe more normalized levels?", "Tom Lynch", "Yes. I would say that there\u2019s a few product line, not so much in the inter connect product but still have longer than normal lead times where it is real global capacity constraints but if you look in the bulk of our business, I'd say we see it in our past two backlog going down, all the indicators are that lead times are pretty close to normal. ", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Okay, and then just kind of a follow-up for Terrence. In terms of just pension assumptions, liability assumptions for 2011, anything changed versus 2010 that we should be aware of here on the income statement or the cash flow statement?", "Terrence Curtin", "Not all. I mean we took typically just sits on the cash flow. We typically made $70 to 90 million of normal cash contribution in the year. That\u2019s what we\u2019re planning and our free cash flow guidance. And then on the pension expense, it\u2019s going to go up a little bit but not much. That\u2019s meaningful Shawn. So when we look at it, we\u2019re well funded to begin with. Most of our plans are frozen especially in the United States. We don\u2019t have as much volatility as other. ", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Steve O\u2019 Brien, JP Morgan. Please go ahead. ", "Steve O'Brien - JP Morgan", "", "Can we talk about the pacing of the 4% to 7% organic growth in fiscal '11, starting the year at 6% to 9% growth? Will there be sort of a settle-in, I think maybe like Tom mentioned here, or is it maybe a modestly slowing year-over-year growth trend for the remaining quarters in terms of or maybe you can put that in context of seasonality as well?", "Tom Lynch", "Sure Steve. Kind of give you a couple points. You go back to the year we just ended. Revenue builds gradually through the year. So seasonality wasn\u2019t as apparent because of the recovery coming of such a little base. So we don\u2019t. If you take our SubCom business aside, we build, kind of built the revenue a 100 million a quarter. 278, 27, 28, 39, 30 X would be SubCom. So kind of the steady march of recovery with the last two quarters settling in including SubCom around 31, the first quarter 31. So you do have in the first half of fiscal \u201911, we\u2019re running at the 31 rival and you compare that to the first half of \u201910, you\u2019re going to have a high organic growth in that period. Then we will have a in the second half. ", "Our current assumption for the second half is that the stronger seasonal period for us slightly improving economic condition but we\u2019ll have growth but it won't be tie as the year-over-year growth we have in the first half because we\u2019re coming of a lower base in the first of \u201910. So we kind of see it as steady gradual march through the year. No hockey stick, no hey, all of a sudden, everything gets better and the second half of our fiscal year \u201911 which is another reason to the other question why we saw enough confidence to give a full year guidance. ", "Steve O'Brien - JP Morgan", "Great. And I guess on the -- sort of the same token for a follow-up here, we talked, I think, last quarter about the cyclicality of network solutions in specialty products lagging the recovery but so maybe being a little bit later cycle. Should we think about those businesses potentially having another couple quarters of acceleration before the overall moving back to the trend of the overall business? ", "Terrence Curtin", "Steve, when you look at it, as I said and during the call, we do expect network solutions. They had a nice recovery here at the past couple of quarter. They do get impacted so network solutions specifically by win or war, both in the utility energy business as well as in the service provider business where we do actually seasonally slow. So what we do expect coming off quarter four that network solutions will be down about 5%. What that typically says down in that level going into quarter two and then accelerates in quarter three and four, you expect my comp sets seasonal increases later in the year but being a little bit stronger as we some of the initiatives that Tom talked about both in energy infrastructure and broadband kick in. ", "So we do see network solutions being back to its seasonal pattern but when it comes back in the summer, it will be a little bit stronger. ", "Tom Lynch", "And I think that\u2019s going to net into the high single digits year-over-year growth \u201911 versus \u201910 that we see every and our assumption is that the recovery continues. ", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from William Stein, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. ", "William Stien - Credit Suisse", "Hi, can you help us understand what happened with the operating margin in network solutions? You saw a good up tick there. It's also the business that you're going to be putting ADC into, and I'm trying to find out if that was related to this commentary around fiber-to-the-node and fiber-to-the-home deployments or if it's something else?", "Terrence Curtin", "If you look at it, well, its couple of things. Number one is it is the volume coming in across all the segments and it has but not later. So the fact to Steve\u2019s question, it did continue to strengthen through its seasonal strong period and we got very nice follow through as you mentioned and in it. So when you look at it, it continues to improve and its really come in and improvement in that volume across our other 10 markets. So what came through this is pretty balanced. We will step down a little bit going into next quarter, just through the seasonality but the margin improvement we saw last quarter is what we expect our network solutions to march up to as it comes off the low point that\u2019 been there.", "William Stien - Credit Suisse", "Okay, so less related to mix and more related to volume? Is that right?", "Terrence Curtin", "Definitely. ", "William Stien - Credit Suisse", "Okay, and then there were some comments in your prepared remarks around the adoption of hybrid electric vehicles. Is there something going on there that kind of is representing a forecast for outsized growth in those types of vehicles relative to traditional that you know about and maybe you can share with us on a region basis?", "Tom Lynch", "Yes. I would say it\u2019s not in the next couple of year but we\u2019re changed at least from my own personal direct observation of going on particularly in China and visiting with our customers in China. Its their level of investment and developing the vehicle and the government, the level of support and investment in working to, with companies to develop the charging stations and even experimenting now in certain cities in China if you are having electric scooter, you can go to a charging station where that charging station exists, you can go to them and plug in and charge right now, I think it\u2019s no charge because they are trying to get the habits going to adapt to electric vehicle.", "So I was with a customer three weeks ago in southern China, OEMs and I mean they are full out working on this and its impressive. And in China, its expected the initial focus so that the government can help it along is going to be in taxis and buses as the first wave. So from difference from two years ago, a lot of talk had to due to extra now lots of company investing and you actually see charging stations. I don\u2019t know how effective they are yet or anything like that but its not on the drawing board anymore, there\u2019s some real product. So I'd say that\u2019s the difference. You certainly see the U.S. company are adjusted with it and as you know, our biggest automotive business is in Europe. ", "And so we\u2019re right in the middle of working with all of our customers there and what they\u2019re trying to do. So this is in planning or slide ware. I mean we\u2019re seeing the customer spend lots of money, demanding lots of products from us so that they can move the ball forward on this. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be significant business in the next few years but we kind of see this, same happening 2015 and beyond. I meant they\u2019ll be some business before it ended but net of getting position now for that. ", "William Stien - Credit Suisse", "Great, that's helpful. Thank you. One really quick one if I can, there were some comments around lead times and the book-to-bill. To me it seems very related. I mean we can expect when lead times are coming in for book-to-bill to decline, and it has no -- it seems to me to have little to no relation to the forecast. If the lead times are coming in you'd expect orders to slow. Am I thinking about that the right way?", "Tom Lynch", "I understand your question. I think I do. Well, I think you\u2019re right. When you have demand that far exceeds supply, we do it on our supply as you put lots of orders in, you want to make sure you\u2019re in line. I think less of that happened this time because where everybody would just a year and half ago. and so, we fully expected the book-to-bills there to come down and get to their kind of normal rate. 1.1, 1.2, 0.99 and so, I think that\u2019s there\u2019s no surprise in that in an offense, its another sign of things getting back to normal in terms of lead times, supply demand, synchronization, steadiness of order rates, at least that\u2019s what we hope, that\u2019s what it seems to be pointing to. ", "And that\u2019s what our assumptions are based around.", "", "Keith Kolstrom", "", "Operator, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "", "Okay. Our last question will come from Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead. ", "Unidentified Analyst ", "", "Yes, good morning. This is actually [Samuel Nee]. I'm in on behalf of Jim Suva at Citi. I was wondering if you can provide some details about the longer strategy of the undersea fiber business given the growth of bandwidth consumption? I know you were awarded two contracts recently and expect sales in the range of $600 million to $700 million this year, but if we look out two to three years what does that segment look like as a percentage of total sales? And maybe highlight larger products that you're focusing on?", "Tom Lynch", "Couple of questions in there. it\u2019s a very important business to us. We have the leading market position there, both front and we have significant strength both in our core fiber transmission capability that was really invented by this group back in the Bell Lab, this day before it was acquired by Tyco International and came with Tyco Electronics and separation. So great technical capability a very capable, fleet capability which is very important to being able to efficiently and make money as laying the cable. Coming of the boom cycle of three year, settling into a what we think for a couple of year will be this kind of $6 to 800 million range. ", "This year, we\u2019re calling it $6 to 700 million range. And then, we don\u2019t really comment on the big project. There\u2019s only a generally kind of 15 of them at a time and our customers require that because these projects tend to be held very close to the vest by the carrier consortiums that are building them but we would expect them in the next few years for activity to pick in the Atlantic as network area is pretty old and the bandwidth is limited. ", "Unidentified Analyst ", "", "Thank you. I appreciate it. ", "Tom Lynch", "The last three years has really been in Asia, Middle East and Africa which we think there\u2019s still a lot of work to do there but everything we see sometime in the next several years in the Atlantic will get some activity again. ", "Unidentified Analyst ", "", "Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. ", "Keith Kolstrom ", "", "Okay. that wraps our call for today. Please contact the IR team with any questions you might have and thanks and have a great day.", "Terrence Curtin", "Thanks everybody.", "Operator", "", "Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be made available for replay after 10:30 a.m. today through November 4th.

With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch; and Chief Financial Officer, Terrence Curtin.", "During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information, and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release.", "In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning, and we ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items.", "The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com.", "[Operator Instructions] Now let me turn the call over to Tom for some opening comments.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. If you can turn to Slide 3, I'll give you a quick summary of Q3 and an overview of our Q4 outlook.", "Q3 results were as follows: Sales of $3.5 billion were up 8% sequentially. This was slightly below our expectations, due to further weakening of the euro which had about a negative $50 million effect and a slower-than-expected recovery in our Network Solutions segment.", "Adjusted operating margin improved 100 basis points sequentially to 14% and very importantly, sequential improvement in all of our segments. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.79 were at the midpoint of our guidance, despite the lower sales. And this is an improvement of 16% sequentially and 4% year-over-year. This year-over-year EPS improvement was on a slight sales decline.", "Free cash flow is very strong at $414 million and that was up 19% over the prior year.", "Uncharacterized Q3 for us is a quarter of good execution. Strong cost control and productivity improvement enabled us to improve operating margins back to the 14% level despite lower-than-expected sales. And importantly, margins improved across all segments.", "In CIS, margins improved 100 basis points sequentially and are essentially at prior year levels on sales that are 12% lower than the prior year. We do expect additional margin improvement in CIS in the fourth quarter.", "We completed the acquisition of Deutsch in April. The integration is on track and as expected. In Q3, Deutsch added about $0.04 of EPS as expected. We're excited about the opportunities this acquisition will provide. They have excellent products and technology as we've discussed before. We're going to add strong channels, the scale to drive cost down and better customer service, and the results we're seeing are a little better than planned, despite the markets being a little softer. We're very -- we're really excited about the quality of the team that joined TE.", "And the cash flow, as we mentioned earlier, was very strong and we completed the sale of our Touch and Services business which generated approximately $400 million of proceeds.", "We entered a little bit on the market environment. We entered the quarter with order momentum building across most of our markets and in particular, in Telecom Networks and our CIS businesses, as the economic outlook was improving in the U.S. Inventories in the channel were back in line, and we experienced a seasonal lift we typically see at this time of the year, especially in our Networks business. So things were tracking pretty much as expected.", "In mid-May, this momentum began to stall and orders began to soften, especially in Telecom and our Industrial and Appliance businesses. We haven't seen a pronounced decline, but we have seen a softening.", "Demand in the automotive and commercial aerospace businesses continues to be solid and we are building in the momentum in the consumer business.", "These trends, coupled with the uncertainty in Europe which is having an impact from a demand and a foreign exchange perspective, and the lower-than-expected growth in China, is resulting in a reduction in our guidance for Q4. I'll go through the details later in the call.", "I do expect us to maintain our margin in the 13.5% to 14% range in Q4, despite the softness, and to deliver another strong cash flow quarter. We also plan to resume our share repurchase program in Q4, and I'll comment more on capital allocation later.", "Before we move into the review of our results and outlook, I'd like to recap the organization changes we announced last week, so if you can turn to Slide 4.", "These changes have been in the planning stage for some time. The regrouping of our business units into these 4 segments had 2 primary objectives. Enabling us to best leverage our capabilities for the customer, and further optimize our efficiency. And we also believe this will provide improved information regarding the performance of the company for our investors.", "The changes in our segment structure are also enabling several of our top business leaders to get expanded or different roles, which I believe is really great for the organization's vitality and future evolution.", "The most noteworthy change, for purposes of this call, is Terrence moving into a segment leadership role. I'm really excited for Terrence and the company. And we're also very fortunate to have Bob Hau succeeding Terrence. Bob, most recently was the CFO of Lennox International, and prior to that, was at Honeywell. Bob is a talented financial leader, with strong multi-industry experience and operating skills, and he'll join us in early August. If you can please turn to Slide 5, and I'll talk about our Q3 sales.", "Total the company sales of $3.5 billion were down 2% year-over-year on an actual basis and down 3% on an organic basis. Currency translation due to the weaker euro, negatively impacted year-on-year growth by 400 basis points or about $143 million, and the Deutsch acquisition contributed $174 million in revenue.", "On an organic basis, year-over-year, sales increased slightly in Asia, but were offset by broad-based weakness in Europe and continued weakness in the North American telecom market.", "In Asia, automotive continued to be strong, offsetting softness in our CIS businesses. In China, we had another quarter of double-digit automotive growth, but most other markets were slower than normal.", "Europe, which accounts for about 1/3 of our total revenue, was down 4% organically from the prior year level and flat sequentially. With the exception of Energy, all of our major businesses were down versus last year. We expect a further slight decline in Europe in Q4, due to the auto seasonal shutdown, and reduced industrial spending at OEMs and in the channel.", "And in general, Europe has been slow for a while and the decline we had seen has been gradual. Steady, but gradual.", "In the U.S., our auto business has been strong and demand in our Telecom and SubCom businesses have been weak. On an organic basis, which excludes Deutsch, our U.S. revenue was down year-over-year and up sequentially. We expect similar trends in Q4 with Telecom weakness and a slowdown in Industrial, offsetting another good quarter in auto and commercial aerospace.", "I'll now turn it over to Terrence to walk through the third quarter results, and then I'll come back to cover the outlook in more detail.", "Terrence R. Curtin", "Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Just before I get started with third quarter performance, I want to remind everyone that the segment reporting changes that Tom mentioned earlier will be effective with the first quarter of fiscal 2013, which begins on September 29. We will report current results in this new structure for the first time, as part of our January 2013 release, and we would expect right now, to file an 8-K with recasted segment historical P&L information by December, which should be well in advance of the January earnings call.", "Now let me give you some highlights to the key markets in each of our segments. Unless I indicate otherwise, all changes will be on an organic basis, which excludes the effect of currencies and acquisitions. So if you could please turn to Slide 6.", "In our Transportation Solutions segment, sales increased 13% on an actual basis versus the prior year, and 6% organically. Sequentially, total sales were up 10%, driven by the acquisition of Deutsch which added $174 million in sales in total, and the breakdown of that between our businesses are $96 million in automotive and $78 million within our Aerospace, Defense and Marine unit.", "Overall in the automotive market, our sales performed as expected, within an organic increase of 7% versus the prior year. Sales were up 22% in Asia and 11% in the Americas. While in Europe, sales were down 4%.", "Global vehicle production was approximately 20.5 million units in the quarter, which was up 10% compared to the prior year. By region, vehicle production was up 20% in the Americas, 22% in Asia. However, the EMEA region remained soft, with production down 8%. The strong year-over-year growth rates in Asia and North America were once again driven by the rebound following the disaster in Japan, as well as our strong market position.", "We expect fourth quarter production to be about 19.5 million vehicles, so we're down about 5% sequentially, in line with typical seasonality driven out of Europe.", "In the Aerospace, Defense and Marine market, sales were flat versus the prior year. Strong demand and increased share in the commercial aerospace and oil and gas markets were offset by declines in the Military market. For the Transportation Solutions overall in the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to be down slightly sequentially, due to the seasonal decline in auto production.", "Part of our sales that relate to Deutsch are expected to be about $180 million which would be up 4% sequentially versus the third quarter, and is -- which is also high single-digit growth when compared to Deutsch standalone versus its prior year. Please turn to Slide 7, so I can cover our Communications and Industrial Solutions segment.", "In this segment, total sales declined 12% on an actual basis, and 9% organically versus the prior year. Sequentially, sales were up 8% organically, which was in line with expectations. In the Industrial market, organic sales were down 14% versus the prior year, but were up 5% sequentially. While we did see temporary improvement in quarter 3, customers, both direct and in the channel, became more cautious around mid-quarter. And due to this, and based upon current order trends, we expect quarter 4 in the Industrial market to be down about 10% sequentially.", "In the DataComm market, which we include sales to the communication equipment, server, storage and wireless equipment markets, our organic sales were down 15% versus last year, due to reduced broadband and wireless spending, particularly with customers in Asia.", "Sales did show a nice sequential improvement and were up 10%. And in quarter 4, we expect revenues in this market to be similar to quarter 3 levels.", "In the consumer area, consumer device revenues were down 4% organically versus the prior year, due to continued softness in the PC and consumer electronics markets, that were partially offset by strong growth in both the mobile and tablet markets.", "Sequentially, our sales grew 9% organically and we expect sales in the fourth quarter to be up 5% to 8% sequentially as well. We are seeing improvement related to the new program wins and new product launches in both the tablet and mobile phone areas.", "In the Appliance business, we were down 3% versus the prior year, due to soft demand in Asia, which was more than offset by growth in the U.S., and sales grew 8% sequentially in this market.", "In the fourth quarter, we expect the CIS segment revenues to be down about mid-single digits sequentially, due mainly to normal seasonality and a softer demand from customers in the Industrial and the Appliance businesses. So please turn to Slide 8, and let me get into the Network Solutions segment.", "Total sales were down 13% on actual rates and down 9% on an organic basis versus the prior year, driven by our Telecom and SubCom businesses. Sales did improve 5% sequentially which was lower than we expected.", "Organic sales to the Telecom Networks market were down 15% versus the prior year, but up 9% sequentially. Year-over-year declines were once again due to reduced carrier spending in the U.S. and Europe.", "As I just mentioned, sequentially sales were up about 9% in this market, but that was only about 2/3 of what we have expected. We saw a nice order momentum coming out of our second quarter, the March quarter, but we did see order rates begin to slow in mid-May in the Telecom market, and currently, we expect sales in -- for the fourth quarter to be down about 5% sequentially.", "Demand in this market, particularly in the U.S. continues to lack consistency. However, the longer-term trends remained attractive, based on the demand for higher speeds and more connected devices.", "In the Energy market, sales were up 3% versus the prior year, with growth in all regions. And we had 6% growth sequentially. We have seen some of the softness in orders. However, we expect revenues in quarter 4 to be up slightly versus quarter 3, driven by continued investment in distribution, transmission and power generation around the world.", "In the Enterprise Networks market, our sales were down 2% as data center investment growth was offset by declines in office network spending.", "And finally, in our SubCom business, our sales declined 21% year-over-year as we expected. We did book about $110 million of projects during the quarter. However, funding of additional order projects continues to be slow. We expect sales in the fourth quarter of approximately $120 million versus our prior expectation of $140 million, due to the push out in these customer fundings.", "For the fourth quarter overall, Network Solutions sales, we expect to be down slightly on a sequential basis, due to the softness in the Telecom Networks business. Let me now shift to earnings, which start on Slide 9.", "Our GAAP operating income for the quarter was $371 million, which includes $94 million of charges related to the acquisition of Deutsch and restructuring charges of $25 million. The Deutsch acquisition-related charges include $68 million of noncash fair value purchase accounting adjustments and cash acquisition charges of $26 million. The $26 million is made up of transaction costs of $15 million and restructuring charges related to cost synergies of $11 million.", "We continue to expect $75 million of total cash charges related to the Deutsch acquisition. About 1/2 of this cash portion will be incurred in 2012, and the remainder in 2013.", "As Tom mentioned, the Deutsch integration is on track and we expect the EBITDA to exit the year at approximately a 28% level, which is slightly ahead of where we reviewed with you when we did the acquisition plan, when we told you would be about 27% at this time.", "Looking at adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income was $490 million in the quarter, with an adjusted operating margin of 14%. This performance is a strong improvement, both in dollars and rate, both year-over-year, as well as sequentially. Both gross and the operating margins were in line with our outlook for the third quarter, despite the lower-than-expected sales in the quarter. The 100 basis-point sequential improvement in operating margin, include an improvement in all segments, driven by the increased volumes and the cost actions that we initiated over the past year in our CIS and Network Solutions segments.", "As Tom mentioned, we do anticipate revenue levels in the fourth quarter to be down sequentially. However, we do expect operating margins to remain in the 13.5% to 14% level with additional improvement in the CIS segment.", "Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.79 and this was up 16% versus the prior quarter, due primarily to the fall through on higher sales and the benefits of our cost and productivity actions. So let's turn to Slide 10.", "If you look at the top half of the slide, our gross margin in the quarter was in line with guidance at 31% on lower-than-expected volumes due to the cost actions I just mentioned and the operating leverage on the sequential volume growth. We expect gross margins to be in excess of 31% in our fourth quarter.", "Looking at the bottom half of the slide, operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 17% as expected. In quarter 4, we expect research development and engineering, as well as SG&A to be approximately 5% and 12.5% of sales, respectively.", "Now let me discuss items on the P&L below the operating line. Please turn to Slide 11.", "Net interest expense was $42 million, up from $37 million in the second quarter, due to a full quarter of interest on the debt that we issued related to the Deutsch acquisition.", "As we discussed when we announced the Deutsch acquisition, part of the debt raised was a pre-funding of our upcoming bond maturity in October. Because of the pre-funding, our net interest expense will remain slightly elevated, again in the fourth quarter, before being reduced in 2013 by about $8 million per quarter, once we pay down the October maturity. We expect a net interest expense of approximately $40 million -- $41 million in the fourth quarter.", "Adjusted other income, which relates to our tax sharing agreement was $9 million. And in quarter 4, we expect other income of approximately $11 million.", "The GAAP effective tax rate was 25% in the quarter, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 26%, which was in line with our guidance and we expect the adjusted tax rate to be about 26% again, in the fourth quarter.", "Now, let me turn to free cash flow and working capital that starts on Slide 12.", "Our free cash flow in the second quarter was $414 million, a very strong result, and up 19% compared to last year. Cash from operations was just below $500 million. And with the strong year-to-date performance, we now expect our free cash flow to exceed $1.3 billion in 2012. At this level, free cash flow will exceed our long-term target of 100% this year.", "Capital spending during the quarter was $115 million. And for the full year, we expect capital spending of approximately 4% of sales, in line with our long-term expectations of 4% to 5% of sales.", "Working capital performance in the quarter was very strong and levels are in line with our expectations. Receivable days outstandings were 62 days and inventory days on hand, reduced to 66 days. The inventory days are a 5-day sequential improvement, and I believe we've done a very good job managing our working capital in this uncertain environment. If you could please turn to Slide 13. Let me discuss sources and uses of cash outside of free cash flow.", "We began the quarter with $2.9 billion of cash and ended the quarter with $1.3 billion. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $90 million which reflect the 17% increase to $0.21 per share per quarter, and we used $2 billion in April to acquire Deutsch. And when you look at this slide, the $2 billion is shown, both in the acquisition line and the repayment of Deutsch debt of $642 million.", "In addition, we received proceeds of $394 million from the sale of our Touch and Services business.", "Outstanding debt was $3.76 billion at the end of the quarter, which is down about $200 million from last quarter due to the commercial paper pay down in the quarter. As I mentioned on the last call, we plan to reduce our debt levels to around the $3 billion level in 2013.", "As Tom mentioned earlier, with the strong free cash flow we expect for the year and the proceeds from our divestitures, we plan to restart our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter. And I want to remind you, that we have $1.5 billion still remaining under our authorization.", "Before I turn it back to Tom to cover the outlook, I'd also like to very quickly say, I've enjoyed my tenure and time here as TE CFO over the past 6 years, and I'd like to thank everyone, both my finance team, all of our employees, as well as our investors and analysts for their support. I'm very much looking forward to my new role, leading the Industrial Solutions segment and the opportunities that we have in the space, and I'm also confident that Bob Hau will be an excellent CFO going forward. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Tom.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Thank you very much, Terrence. If you turn to Slide 14, I'll talk about what we're seeing in our order trends.", "As I mentioned earlier, the order rate started to slow around the middle of the third quarter, particularly in CIS and Networks. And right now, orders are continuing to run around the $3.4 billion per quarter rate, which is down about 3% organically versus our last outlook. So what we saw in March and April were orders running in the $3.6 billion range, slightly higher. And then it began to soften.", "And as we all know, there's a great deal of uncertainty in most markets, particularly as it relates to the weak economy in Europe.", "In our Transportation segment, book-to-bill was 1.01. Orders continued to be solid with steady demand in the automotive and commercial aerospace markets. In CIS, book-to-bill was 0.97, with particular softness noted in the Industrial business and in the distribution channel, as customers continue to be very cautious.", "In Network Solutions, excluding SubCom, book-to-bill was 0.99. But spending by telecom carriers continues to be less predictable and below expected levels. The net of all this is demand in our Telecom businesses, including SubCom, is at one of the lowest levels in several years due primarily to the slow global economy.", "We're the leading provider of fiber connectivity. And based on the fundamental bandwidth expansion needs, we believe this -- the long-term growth of this market is going to be in the mid to high single-digit range. And we very much earn a strong position to capitalize on this growth.", "If you turn to Page 15 or Slide 15, I'll cover the current outlook.", "For the fourth quarter, we expect our sales to be in the range of $3.325 billion to $3.425 billion, which is down 2% to 5% sequentially. EPS are expected to be $0.72 to $0.76 per share, or down or 4% to 9% sequentially. Versus our prior guidance, the difference is due to a weaker economic outlook, a weak Telecom market, and the weakness in Europe and the continuing weakening euro. The euro itself is causing a decline of about $80 million in sales and a negative $0.02 earnings per share impact. If you turn to Slide 16 for our full year outlook.", "Full year sales are expected to be $13.25 billion to $13.35 billion, which is down slightly versus 2011 on an organic basis. Earnings are expected to be $2.82 to $2.86, also down slightly versus 2011 adjusted earnings per share of $2.95, excluding the extra week that we had in 2011.", "The euro has created about a 300 basis-point headwind to our overall sales growth, compared to last year, and about a $0.09 negative impact.", "A few final thoughts before we open it up for Q&A. It is clearly a challenging economic environment, but I think you can see where we're holding the operating margins, that we're taking the appropriate action. I continue to feel really good about our portfolio, the range of connectivity products and solutions we offer. We did make 2 big acquisitions over the last year and a half to become the leader in fiber optic connectivity and to become one of the top 2 players in hours activity, and I really think the integrations are going well. The synergies are on or ahead of plan, and this is just going to make us a stronger company for the long time. And at the same time, we continue to focus the portfolio, most recently with the divestiture of the Touch and Services business.", "We're getting back on track in tablets and smartphones. A small part of our business still, but we have a little momentum there. And in -- really importantly, our operating leverage is -- leverage continues to improve. And within that, as we mentioned, CIS margins are picking up momentum again, with 2 quarters in a row improvement and we expect Q4 to be at the third quarter.", "When you look at performance versus 2011 on a 52-week basis, second half margin will be about 50 basis points higher this year, and EPS will be about equal with the second half of 2011 on sales that are 3% lower. So again, we're managing the middle of the P&L very well in my opinion. And second half EPS will be up about 17% versus the first half of 2012.", "And I think our strong suit, which is our cash flow, it's going to continue to get stronger. And as Terrence mentioned, we'll start regular share repurchases this quarter.", "Just a little more comment on capital allocation. We're pretty much completing our first 5 years since we separated. And in that time, we generated over $7 billion of free cash flow. We used about $4.4 billion of that for return on capital and about $3.4 billion for M&A. So the ratio is about 55%, 45% return on capital. And our priorities were to #1, strengthen the needs of the company and make sure that the strategic position of the company got stronger. And of course secondly, any capital we didn't use for that, to make sure we return promptly to the shareholders.", "When I look forward, our priorities are going to change. I think #1 will be a consistent return of capital. We'll continue to look for bolt-on M&A in targeted markets, but I think you can think of us kind of a 2/3, capital return, 1/3, reinvest in the company. So I think we're positioned to do that. We like the make up for the portfolio and we certainly expect to get, to continue to generate strong cash flow.", "I think the bottom line of all that is it's definitely uncertain out there, but we're really confident in our strategy and in our ability to execute well through the challenging environment. So thank you, and now, we'll open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I just have 2 questions. Tom, maybe when you look at the operating margin profile, you guys are clearly doing a good job of hitting the 14% target on sub $3.5 billion revenue now. The mix though looks like, of margin to just Transportation has been doing a lot of the heavy lifting. How do you think of margins with the other 2 segments? And could you maybe talk about what gets the other 2 segments to 14% off margins, in terms of for a revenue run rate or for the cost initiative, especially in the Network Solutions side?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Sure. Yes, I think your comment that Transportation has been carrying the load is right. And Networks, I think the issue there is with the bottom of the cycle. We think that I would expect that group of businesses to get back to 15% as the revenue comes up. I think inherently, it's -- the gross margins in that business are good. Some of the highest we have in the company. So it's really a volume, more of a volume issue. Clearly, we continue to drive productivity there. On the CIS, I think it was a combination of 2 things. One, the market softened and the channel correction that happened in the first half of the year, in response to that, we took a lot of cost out. So there's clearly significant cost actions we've taken in that business. And now as revenue -- even though it's not picking up, you can see us improving the margin and we should get significant lift in that business, as the margin -- as the revenue picks up.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And then Tom, maybe I'm reading too much into this. But I think you said, that you guys intend to return 2/3 of the free cash flow back to shareholders. That seems a high number at 67%. Whereas in the past, you've talked about 50% to 60%. Could you verify that? And then would the split between buybacks and dividends change on a go-forward basis?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Well, as I said, we ran about 55, 45 return to M&A in the first 5 years. And if my memory serves me right, about 2/3 of the return was buyback, and 1/3, dividend. So dividend is about $1.4 billion and return's about $2.9 billion in that period. I do think because we've made 2 significant acquisitions that really fill the 2 key strategic areas that by -- almost by definition, going forward, that there'll be much more focus on a consistent return of capital and bolt-on acquisitions. I would never say never, but that's what I say when I think -- when you think in terms of the model, the 55%, the 60% to 70%, is how I think of it as a return. I would expect us to continue to raise the dividend, as long as global economies are sound and our earnings are keeping in line with our target dividend yield. I hope that answers your question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from line of Matt Sheerin representing Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Just a question on the commentary on the CIS business and specifically, the channel softness. Obviously, you went through an inventory correction there. And it sounds like distributors are being more cautious. But what is sell-through look like in inventory levels? Are they bringing down inventories yet again? Or are they just being super cautious here?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Matt, I think it's more of the latter, super cautious. A quarter ago, when we were all together, I think we were feeling cautiously bullish as the inventory correction was over and we saw in Q2, and in Q3 actually, the lift in sequential revenue through the channel and their sell-throughs were going up. But as this slowdown began to happen in mid-May, with U.S. jobs peaking and all those other things, everybody's just starting to dial back a little bit. I don't think the inventory and the channel, a problem. I think just that -- what we've gone through over the last 5 years, a couple of times collectively, everybody is managing that much more closely, and including ourselves, where our inventory days are actually down this quarter. I think it's just -- everybody's a little bit gun-shy.", "Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "You're getting the sense that the distribution point-of-sales has weakened as well, going into this quarter?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "No. I think the slope is just changed. It was ramping, and now it's flattening, and I think that's just leading the caution.", "Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then on the OpEx side, it looks like you're holding margins fairly well, given the volume softness across different parts of your business. If we're in this sort of a component cycle that's stuck here and we continue to see softness, are you looking at other cost-cutting measures, whether it be in CIS or other businesses, particularly networking, where it doesn't look like things have bottomed yet?", "Terrence R. Curtin", "I would say, Matt, I think as we proved over the last year, if we do, we will continue to assess where are we from a volume level and we will take actions as appropriate. So I think what you can expect, and I think what you saw, like we did in CIS over the past year -- CIS was an area that we had to adjust it. We're happy that in the third quarter, we're back to prior year OI levels even on lower volume. Essentially in there, we're going to prove it. So we see markets change that fundamentally, we sort of had a higher level that we will take -- we'll evaluate further cost out. So...", "Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "It doesn't sound like you're at the point now where you're ready to do that. You feel like things have at least, fabbed -- aren't you getting materially worse? Is that fair or...", "Thomas J. Lynch", "I'd say there's not much visibility, Matt, but what we do have is a pretty robust set of alternatives of what we do, depending on the circumstances. And even though, as we entered the second half of the year, we were expecting, I'd say modest recovery and normal seasonality, we weren't -- we kept our cost structure more conservative to that. And that's why, we were able to get the margin to where it is. So that's -- we're taking a very conservative view, not in a way that would hurt our responsiveness to customers. But it's uncertain out there, and so we're managing it accordingly.", "Operator", "And we'll go to the line of Shawn Harrison representing Longbow Research.", "Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC", "I just wanted to talk a little bit about Deutsch. It sounds as if margins are going to be better exiting the year than you anticipated, and high single-digit revenue growth year-over-year. Maybe if you could just speak to where that revenue growth could get over the next 12 months? Can you see it accelerate, given the feedback you're getting from the channel? And then, why is profitability running a little bit better than expected?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "I think a couple of things. On the profitability, the teams had been tremendous at getting at the early synergy opportunities ahead of schedule. So that's helped. The revenue is off slightly, and that's economics, but it's still up year-over-year and the business is solid. I'd say it's -- we're not calling next year yet. It's a little outside our window, and we'll talk about that next quarter, but we're very bullish about the business. We do expect that we'll get lift through the channel because they -- especially in their Aerospace and Military business, they didn't really have much there and we bring a lot there. We're the biggest player to those channels. So I mean, we'll definitely be able to help that there and that's part of that channel strength comment before. And I think we'll continue to find more opportunities for cost synergy. Just because of our size, helping them buy materials cheaper, and things like that. So we feel good about it. It's a little bit hard to call the market, the end-demand environment, but -- much like we did with ADC, the end-to-end system we can offer in fiber, we have that end-to-end hours connectivity we can offer into the Industrial and commercial market, every application we can serve. So we're very, very excited about that.", "Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. And then as a follow-up, just with restarting the share purchase program and understanding that you have some debt coming due, how aggressive do think you'll be in terms of repurchasing stock during the fourth quarter?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Well, we're going to get started. As you know, this quarter, I think our main thing is to be consistent within a certain range. And I think that's the thing that -- we have bought back a lot of shares, but when we've made acquisitions, we've turned it off. They were big acquisitions. You can expect us to be consistent in -- and I'd say, think about the 150 to 250 range.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I just wanted to get a little bit of detail on what you're seeing or what you're hearing from customers in the networking segment, and clearly there's lots of long-term demand drivers, but as you've noted in that segment, it continues to be weak. Do you have any sense from your customers about when they expect to see a pickup in that market?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Yes. We talk to them regularly. I think it really -- it's a customer-by-customer situation in that business. Last year, Europe was very strong, for example, and the customers were more aggressive even than we thought. This year, they've turned that back. I think it's some of that uncertainty. In the U.S., it started very slow because of all the strategic activities that was going on in the U.S. telecom market. So we have seen the U.S. pick up. It's just not anywhere near the rate, and it was slow last year in the second half. So I think it was a combination of caution, as well as -- if I'm going to spend a little more capital, and I believe that at -- overall, CapEx spending is down, a little more going into the wireless versus the fiber, right now. That's not unusual a few years back. The big push in the fiber to the home, or fiber deep into the premise-type program, those have slowed down. No surprise. We fully expected that. So it's really a case-by-case. And we've seen China slow a bit. It was very strong for us last year, slowing down this year.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, great. That's helpful. And then in terms of the consumer business, consumer devices. That has been a segment where you've been struggling. This quarter, you mentioned PC's down, but you said tablets were a bit better. Can you give us a little more detail? And do you think you're gaining share in that market?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "I think we're growing with the market now, Sherri. I think, as you know, we had -- before the double whammy, the customers -- our customers that were losing share, we were strong with them. We hadn't established with the customers that are winning share. So in the last year, it's been about stabilizing the business, both from a top line and a market position and a cost perspective. I think our team has done a tremendous job of doing that. And now we have, we've won several important programs that should -- I used to call it a beach head. I think it's more than a beach head for us now. Still a small part of our business. But this last quarter, in terms of the programs you want and the orders we got, we show good [ph]. So I'd say we're now growing with the market, and that tablet and smartphone market is growing 40% to 50% or 30% to 40%, something like that, and we're finally growing with that, even though it's a small part of our business. So for us, the proof point is, we can serve these customers. We have the technology, and we can get more than 1 or 2 wins. We still have to build on that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jim Suva, representing Citi.", "Samuel Meehan", "This is actually Samuel Meehan, on behalf of Jim Suva. I want to get a couple more details about Europe. When you look at the weakness in Europe, European automotive, have you seen any mixed shifts or model push outs that would have a significant impact on content dollars per vehicle?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "No. Not really. I'd say the strength is still in the high end and a lot of that is exported from Germany to the U.S. and China, and that part is still robust. Most of the weakness is in the Southern Europe OEMs. So we have not seen any negative shifts in content because of mix of cars.", "Operator", "Now we have a question from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.", "Ruplu Bhattacharya", "This is Ruplu filling in for Wamsi. Just -- you've talked about the margins and transport connectivity. I just wanted to touch on that again. Some margins improved quite a bit, 140 basis points sequentially. How much of that was Deutsch and how do you see -- how should we think about margins going into the September quarter? Do you think you can maintain that higher margin?", "Terrence R. Curtin", "#1, Deutsch as we talked on our last call, both in Transportation as well as the total company, is about 10 to 20 basis points of NOI benefit. So when you look at that part of the question -- when you look at the fourth quarter because we will have seasonal slowdown in Europe, we do participate in the shutdowns that the OEMs have. We do expect our margin in Transportation to be about 16% in the fourth quarter. I think when you look at what's offsetting that, we do expect a further improvement in our CIS segment, going the other way, that helps us to cost improvements that we've had there in CIS. The combination is going to allow us to keep our margin up in that 13.5% to 14% level, Ruplu.", "Ruplu Bhattacharya", "Okay, got it. Just as a follow-up on subsea. I see you've lowered the guidance a little bit from 5 20 to 4 90 for the full year. Last quarter, you talked about one contract coming in later this year. Is that the contract that is being pushed out? And you also mentioned something about $110 million. When did those come into revenue?", "Terrence R. Curtin", "If you look at that, Ruplu, the 110 we booked during the quarter was actually a number of smaller projects, really in the oil and gas area. The one project that we've talked about last fall, you're correct. That customer has not completed his funding yet and that's really why the revenue is down from the 140 that we expected last quarter, in fourth quarter, down to the 120. The 110 that we'd talked about, they will be contracts that start up next year and it will be as part of next year.", "Operator", "Again, we have a question from Amitabh Passi with UBS.", "James F. Hillier - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "This is Jim Hillier for Amitabh. I was hoping in light of some of the macro trends, you can provide us any color on the current pricing environment as well as how lead times are currently trending?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Pricing overall I'd say, not any big change. I mean, I think there's always pricing pressure in the business. But we're not seeing any unusual pressure. It always feels like a lot of pressure. But nothing unusual here. So I think we'll continue to be in that -- I'd expect to be, plus or minus at 2% price erosion range.", "Terrence R. Curtin", "And on lead times, lead times have been at normal levels. I mean, certainly on certain products for certain customers and applications, that's specific, but on an overall basis, you look at our lead times, there's no extension or contraction of them. They've been at normal levels for most of this year.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "I think what we see more is just change orders. A little more frequent. So it's people waiting, waiting to buy until they get a little more sure. So it's not so much that the fundamental lead times are reducing, but we do see a little more churn in the order.", "James F. Hillier - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And if I could also follow-up on your telco business. It appears that while spending has been weak, if look at the budget outlooks for some of the major North American carriers, spending looks more back half-weighted this year. And from your customer conversations, do you think that ultimately we could see some improvement in this business by year end? And also as a follow-on to that, if you any update on the NBN ramp, that would be really helpful.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Say, for us, we're only 2 months away from our year end. So could there be, yes. I'd say the general feedback has been it's coming. It's coming. And it's been a little slower than obviously, than we expected. Could it happen by the end of the calendar year? I mean, our fundamental view is that pent-up demand is happening because of this. Because you still have to be able to invest more in the wireless part. You still have to get the signal in the ground to have the coverage and the capacity really work. So I'd say we expect the investment to pick up in our portion of the network, but it's hard to call the timing right now. I mean, a quarter ago, we were feeling pretty good in seeing the ramp, that it was our Q3 and Q4 which would have been the June and September quarters. We got half of what we expected in Q3 and it's not going to -- right now, our call is that it's not going to happen in Q4.", "Terrence R. Curtin", "And on your NBN -- NBN for our 2012 is about $20 million. We're going to -- we started to get some of that program, started to ramp here on our quarter 3. A similar amount in quarter 4. Next year, right now, we would expect that to increase up to $50 million, $60 million, as that program continues to ramp.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie Capital.", "Mike Wood - Macquarie Research", "Tom, with the recent management changes, are you expecting any sort of -- after everyone takes over and gets set in the job, are they supposed to come back with cost savings initiatives or growth initiatives, investment suggestions?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "We always expect that. I think with this -- look, I think we'll get some fresh looks at things. Right? But all these 4 leaders have been in the company from anywhere from 3 to 25 years. So they may know the company pretty well. We -- they've been part of the senior team for several years now. So they understand even the business they're going into, while it may be new for them to run, they understand it pretty well. So -- but I do think that my comment on vitality, and what I mean by that is, it's good when people shift around, especially if it's not that disruptive because they've been around and they already know the business. So I do expect to get new ideas. Absolutely. I don't expect us to turn the place upside down, as a result of it. But I do expect that we're going to be stronger as a result of these changes.", "Mike Wood - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And on the Transportation side, your orders were above the growth of global OEM production. Your sales reported were slightly below that. Has that segment also been impacted by the destocking that you'd mentioned, just given the uncertainty ahead of the plant shutdowns in Europe?", "Terrence R. Curtin", "No. No. Really, Mike, when you look at it, what you saw in the third quarter of our sales being a little bit less in production, really just due to our Asia content per vehicle and what we've got in Japan, just being such a weight on the production growth. In the fourth quarter, we expect our sales to be greater than production and we expect it to be that way for the year. So it's really just how the production builds were going around the world.", "Operator", "And we will go to the line of Mike Wherley with Janney Capital.", "Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "I just wanted to ask on the restructuring. So you're not talking about any further actions right now. But the restructuring that you've already done, is that going to roll through immediately in the fiscal fourth quarter? Or will it be more of a fiscal 2013 event?", "Terrence R. Curtin", "Most of the restructuring has to do with the Deutsch integrations. So when you look at that, it mainly relates to Deutsch and the integration of Deutsch into our structure. That will come in the relationship as we have the Deutsch integration. There are some tailing items that are coming. But most of those costs are already in, or will be in, in the fourth quarter. So some of those costs you see are tails related to prior actions.", "Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay, so in the CIS segment, for example, is the benefit already being realized in the third quarter? Or will there be some upside in the fourth quarter?", "Terrence R. Curtin", "As I've said, we do expect CIS margin to go up sequentially. There is a little bit more benefit because the volume's coming down. But there will be a little bit of benefit in the fourth quarter.", "Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just on the smartphone and tablet commentary. Are you getting on to more platforms? I mean, I know you mentioned a few wins. But is it about a broader set of customers? Or is it more content uptake on each platform that's sort of helping you out there? Which is it more?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "It's more customers. It's a couple of customers we really haven't had much of a position with, and now we have a starting position with them. So we have more customers in a broader way and in a deeper way than we did a year ago, is the way I think about it.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to the line of Craig Hettenbach with Goldman Sachs.", "Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Tom, you mentioned -- or commented on the stable trends in the automotive market. Can you talk about just how suppliers and customers are managing inventory through this environment? Did you see any type of change through the quarter?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "No. I think -- I mean, everybody is tight. Where we see it is, as I kind of mentioned earlier, a little more churn in the releasing of orders. So which -- I think it's typical. Right now, in Europe, we're going into the shutdown season. So the Southern OEMs are going to shut down for more than normal, but that's no surprise. We've been expecting and planning that for months. I think it will be kind of a normal shutdown in the North. But inventory levels, whether on the lot or in the channel, seem to be in pretty good shape, and our inventory levels are in good shape.", "Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then if I could just follow up on the smartphone and tablet piece, you commented, you think you now have a beach head. Any thoughts around the types of technology? I know you've done antennas, how the kind of connectors fit in, and is there an opportunity to kind of expand your content on programs as you go forward?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "I think there's an opportunity to expand it, but within the products that we know best. So right now, our focus is on the key things we do, antennas connect, and connecting systems. So -- no, we're not -- not to say we will never stray from that, but I think there's just so much opportunity as we continue to get better. The good news is we have the technology. We have the products. It's for us. It's -- our problem in the past has been more about execution and the pace of execution, and we're really improving that. And now we have to build a track record. We earn a couple of programs, do well, and then we earn a few more. And that's the way we're -- the approach we're taking.", "Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and how much -- I know you guys have talked about the management change about a year ago, in terms of the customer interface and things like that, how much has that come into play, in terms of the ability to gain traction now?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "The changes we did with our channel?", "Terrence R. Curtin", "In consumer.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "In consumer, I'm sorry. That's helped a lot. Organizing around the vertical markets which -- it took us a while to take the CIS and break it into these global vertical businesses. But it's -- one of the first we did was consumer and that has made a massive difference, as well as the leadership that's in that group. So they've made all the difference in the world. We have better customer intimacy and relationships and we're executing better. And we just have to keep doing it.", "Operator", "And next, we go to the line of Anthony Kure with KeyBanc.", "Anthony C. Kure - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Just a couple of quick ones. Can you just talk about China, specifically how it progressed through the quarter, and if you saw any inflection points, maybe to the negative and then any change in that, relatively recently, just maybe talk about the linearity of China through the quarter if possible?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "I think China has been steady, but slower than we thought. When we sat there a quarter ago, we would have been expecting, and as you know, the government was keeping interest rates up, trying to cool things off, trying to cut back on some of the speculation in housing that was going on and trying to head that off and of course, balance that with economic growth. We saw that for sure, the first 2 quarters. We thought by the third quarter, that, that would begin to pass and that stimulus would happen. Now, there's still applying stimulus. It was announced and things like that, but we haven't really seen it pick up. Auto has been still very robust, although slowing a little bit slower than it's -- for sure, than it has the last couple of years, but still high. 15%, 18% for us. But a lot of our other businesses are flat to -- even slight. In some cases, slightly down. Now, some of that, is the exports are down because of Europe and U.S. But it's -- I haven't seen an inflection point. No. I'd say our people on the ground there expect things to get better because of what the government is saying. But it's hard to call.", "Anthony C. Kure - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful color. And I guess in a similar vein, instead of China, maybe on the enterprise IT market, I'm just hearing consistently now that the sea level folks make -- the decision makers here are really taking a sharper eye on budgets in the second half of the calendar year. I'm just wondering, is that -- are you seeing that? And has that had any differences among the geographies, either better or worse?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "I'd say we're seeing it pretty broad-based. That second quarter to third quarter, our business that serves those markets picked up, recent sequential pickup, we would have expected that. Again, go back 3 months, we would have expect some sequential pickup in Q4. We don't expect that now in this outlook. So I agree with you. We're feeling that as well.", "Operator", "And we have a follow-up from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I just want to maybe talk a little bit about the commodity cost, how that's playing out in the September quarter and your progress there? And then secondly, given the fact that FX has been a fairly severe revenue and to some degree, and EPS headwind for you guys this year. Any confidence on a hedged FX on a rolling 12-month basis that you guys come up with annual guidance?", "Terrence R. Curtin", "Amit, it's Terrence. So 2 things. Let me take the second piece first. So #1, we do hedge transactionally. We don't hedge translationally. I mean, you are right if you look at this year. It is a significant headwind that we're dealing with, almost $400 million with the euro weakening. I don't see us changing our policy around hedging translation because of -- our earnings are also hedged because that translation comes through at the OI margin. When you look at metals. Metals is a slight benefit right now. As you know, we have a risk management process that we do on how we fix. So really when you look at it, metals are a slight benefit, not significant due to the position we put in place when copper and gold and silver were a little bit higher. So we're relatively fixed out for the next 6 to 9 months pretty firmly. There may be some benefit if metals stay where they are and later next year. But right now, it's pretty minor benefit.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And it goes on the metal hedging. It's still a rolling kind of 2 quarter-out process, right?", "Terrence R. Curtin", "It actually goes out 18 months. But the more current it is, the heavier we are fixed from a ratio of what we buy, and then it sort of goes out overtime. But you're right, it's a rolling 18-month program.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "This is Tom. Before we cut off the call. Just a few closing comments or 1 closing comment. Terrence and I have been together since we separated in the year before that in the business, and it's been -- for me, it's been fantastic. Many of you, if not all of you out there have had the opportunity to deal with Terrence and the consummate", "Pro. A guy who loves, and committed to the company, and he's made it a lot better. And in his new role, he's going to make it even better. So I know, it's not easy for him to unplug from this part of the job. But boy, I'll tell you, he's done a good job. He's left our organization in great shape. He's been integral in recruiting a tremendous successor. And he's going to take this other business, in my mind no question, to another level. So thank you, Terrence for everything you've done. And thanks, everybody, on the call. I appreciate it.", "Terrence R. Curtin", "Thank you, everyone.", "Keith Kolstrom", "Thanks for joining our call. Please feel free to follow up with the IR team, with any follow-up questions. Thanks.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

Welcome to the TE Connectivity Quarter One Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.", "And I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Keith Kolstrom. Please go ahead, sir.", "Keith Kolstrom", "Thanks. Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity\u2019s first quarter 2013 results. With me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch; and Chief Financial Officer, Bob Hau.", "During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today\u2019s press release. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning, and we ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items. The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com.", "Finally, for participants on the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call, I would like to remind everyone to please limit themselves to one follow-up question.", "Now, let me turn the call over to Tom for some opening comments.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. If you could please turn to slide three and we\u2019ll get started. First quarter results were in line with our expectations, as strong margin performance offset slightly weaker than expected sales, particularly in our Network segment.", "Orders were up 3% versus prior year to $3.1 billion and strengthened through the quarter in most of our businesses, primarily due to improved economic conditions in the U.S. and China. And excluding SubCom, our book-to-bill for the quarter was 1.02, which compares to about a 0.98 last year.", "We also had another strong free cash flow quarter generating $304 million. And of that, returned $267 million to shareholders through dividends and the repurchase of approximately 5 million shares. We expect to return over 1 billion to shareholders for the full year as we also indicated on our prior call.", "I\u2019m encouraged by the order trends, also encouraged by our strong execution on productivity and the traction we\u2019re making on the cost reduction programs we announced last quarter. And as a result, we do expect increased sales and earnings in the second quarter and we expect to deliver a strong second half.", "Please turn to slide four. Total company sales of $3.13 billion were down 1% versus the prior year and down 4% on an organic basis. Currency translation negatively impacted year-on-year growth by $43 million and the Deutsch acquisition contributed $148 million in revenue.", "Versus the prior-year, revenue in our Transportation and Industrial segments were up low single-digits due to the addition of Deutsch. The Network and Consumer segment declined in the quarter. The Network decline represents a continuation of weak CapEx spending and many segments of the broadband network. Consumer was down slightly due to weak PC demand, more than offsetting our improving position in tablets and smartphones.", "By region, compared to the prior year, revenues were up 4% in the Americas, down 2% in Europe, and down 5% in Asia. Within Asia, China was up about 4%. However, the rest of Asia was down primarily due to weakness in Japan.", "Please turn to slide five and I\u2019ll provide some highlights of our segment performance. Transportation had another strong quarter of performance with sales up 3% and adjusted operating income up 10%. Overall, global light vehicle production was up slightly versus the prior year with growth in the U.S. and China offsetting declines in Europe and Japan. Commercial vehicle production continued to be soft in Q1, but orders have strengthened early in the current quarter, and we expect sales in this segment to continue to grow in Q2.", "Please turn to slide six. Revenues and adjusted operating income in our Network business were down 8% versus the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, the market for broadband network equipment, particularly in the wireline portion of the market, continues to be soft. And we don\u2019t expect to see this improvement till late in the second half.", "Project activity in the SubCom business remains robust, but the funding continues to be slow. And we actually expect this business to bottom in the second quarter. So we have a strong pipeline, but projects coming into force have been slow.", "With respect to the Network segment overall, I still continue to be bullish despite the fact that we\u2019re in this pretty extended lull in demand on the wireline side. The underlying trends would say that the network has to continue to be built out with small base stations coming and the need to drive fiber close to the home to get the data rate that consumers and businesses demand. We think the market will be coming back. It\u2019s been hard to call the timing, but we\u2019ll still remain bullish on the underlying market trends.", "Now during this lull, we\u2019ve been pretty aggressive, as we mentioned last quarter, in taking costs out. So much like we did in automotive in the downturn, we\u2019re positioned in this business for a really strong rebound in sales and earnings growth as demand picks up.", "Please turn to slide seven. Revenue in the Industrial segment was up 2% as the Deutsch acquisition offset continued weak demand in the industrial equipment and solar markets. Adjusted operating margins up 12%, were down as expected due to the low sales level. Based on normal seasonality and improving order trends, we expect steady sales and margin improvement over the balance of the year. And we expect our margin in this segment to be up several points by the end of the year.", "Please turn to slide eight. Sales in our Consumer segment were down 4% versus the prior year, with adjusted operating margins up 300 basis points and adjusted operating income up 32%. We\u2019re finally beginning to see the results of our efforts in tablets and smartphones, and getting increased number of designing with the important customers in this segment.", "However, this growth was offset by general weakness in the PC market, which is still a large portion of our Consumer Devices business. Adjusted margins improved in this segment over the prior year, primarily as a result of improved productivity and cost reduction actions.", "Now, let me turn it over to Bob, who\u2019s to going to cover the financials in more detail.", "Bob Hau", "Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Let me discuss earnings, which start on slide nine. Our GAAP operating income for the quarter was $293 million, which includes restructuring charges of $92 million and Deutsch acquisition-related charges of $5 million. Adjusted operating income was $390 million with an adjusted operating margin of 12.4%, up 30 basis points from Q1 last year.", "GAAP and adjusted EPS were $0.65 for the quarter. GAAP EPS included $0.15 of restructuring and other charges, and $0.01 of acquisition-related charges, offset by $0.16 of income related to tax items. The tax income was primarily related to the settlement of an audit of prior year tax returns as we continue to make progress on resolving our pre separation shared tax liabilities.", "Please turn to slide 10. Our adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 31.6%. Despite sales that were slightly lower than expected, both gross and operating margins were above our outlook for the quarter as a result of increased productivity and rigorous cost and spending controls. Total OpEx spending was $599 million in the quarter. And this was up about 7% versus the prior year largely due to the addition of Deutsch.", "The right side of the slide details items in the P&L below the operating line. Net interest expense was $33 million for the first quarter, about flat versus the prior year. I expect approximately $32 million of expense per quarter for the remainder of the year. Adjusted other income, which relates to our tax-sharing agreement, was $5 million versus our outlook of $9 million.", "On a GAAP basis, taxes were a benefit in the quarter, due primarily to the settlement of an audit of prior year tax returns as I mentioned earlier. The adjusted effective tax rate was 23%, slightly lower than the 24% to 25% guidance. Both adjusted other income and adjusted tax expense were lower, and the net effect was no impact to EPS compared to guidance. For the remainder of the year, I expect other income of about $8 million per quarter and tax rate of 23% to 24%, which is slightly lower than what we guided last quarter.", "Please turn to slide 11. Cash from continuing operations was $393 million. Our free cash flow in Q1 was a very strong $304 million. This was a very good start to the fiscal year as free cash flow is typically the lowest in the first quarter. We continue to expect free cash flow to approximate net income going forward.", "Capital spending during the quarter was $124 million or about 4% of sales. This is consistent with historic levels of approximately 4% to 5% of sales. Working capital levels are in line with our expectations. Receivable days outstanding were 63 days and inventory days on hand were 74 days, both up slightly versus the prior year primarily due to the addition of Deutsch. Our businesses continue to do a very good job managing working capital.", "Now, let me discuss the sources and uses of cash outside of free cash flow shown on the right side of the slide. We began the quarter with $1.6 billion of cash and ended the quarter with about $1 billion. During the quarter, we returned a total of $267 million to shareholders. We paid dividends of $89 million and repurchased 5 million shares for $178 million.", "The cash flow statement shows a slightly lower dollar amount for share repurchases due to the timing difference on actual payment of funds. We continue to expect additional share repurchases of $150 million to $250 million per quarter in fiscal 2013.", "Outstanding debt was $3 billion at the end of the quarter. As I have discussed on last quarter\u2019s earnings call, debt was reduced by approximately $700 million in early October with the pay off of notes that had matured. We expect debt levels to remain at approximately $3 billion for fiscal 2013. And finally, on December 26, Standard & Poor\u2019s raised the credit rating on TE from BBB to BBB+ with a stable outlook based on our stronger performance.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Tom.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks, Bob. Please turn to slide 12. We are beginning to see some positive signs in the U.S. and China as order strengthened during the quarter. I mentioned this earlier. And this momentum has continued into January, the first three weeks of January. All segments except Network had a positive book-to-bill in the quarter. And our overall book-to-bill was 1.02 excluding SubCom. As a result, we are a little more optimistic that we will see continued demand improvement as the year progresses.", "Please turn to slide 13. Based on the order trends, we expect revenue in Q2 to be in the $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion range and adjusted EPS in the $0.68 to $0.72 range. At the midpoint, revenue would be about flat versus the prior year with EPS up 3% and adjusted operating margins would be between 12.5% and 13%.", "We expect approximately $100 million of restructuring charges in the second quarter as we are accelerating our cost improvement actions. On a year-over-year basis, revenues in the Transportation segment would be up about 5% primarily due to the addition of Deutsch, as growth in automotive is offset by a weaker demand for industrial and commercial vehicles. Networks will be down about 8% primarily due to weakness in SubCom.", "Please turn to slide 14. For the full year, we expect sales in the range of $13.3 billion to $13.7 billion and adjusted EPS of $3.05 to $3.25. And the midpoint of $3.15 is consistent with our prior guidance on lower sales of about $200 million. At the midpoint of this guidance, adjusted EPS would be up about 10% on revenue growth of about 2%.", "We expect the total of approximately $225 million of restructuring charges for the full year. And this is an increase of $25 million versus prior guidance as we plan to accelerate several actions in response to the current slow environment. We do expect stronger than normal earnings improvement in the second half and I\u2019ll highlight the key reasons for that.", "Global auto production is expected to improve slightly in the second half compared to the first half. We are expecting a modest pickup in Network and Industrial Solutions demand relative to the first half of the year, and slightly up versus the second half of last year, which is not very strong. We do expect SubCom revenues to return to the $125 million per quarter in the second half. And we have won the awards and now they need to go into force. And as I mentioned, the key there is getting the funding, but we believe we\u2019re getting closer.", "Momentum in our Consumer Device business continues. We have a number of new products we\u2019re launching that will go into the market in the second half. So that\u2019s another key milestone for us in this business contributing to the sales growth. And then we\u2019re expecting a continuation of a slow but steady recovery in the industrial vehicle market. As I mentioned earlier, the orders in that market segment have been very strong over the last four to five weeks.", "And then last but certainly not least, we expect to continue the margin improvement due to our Lean programs and the accelerated cost improvement action. So, about half the revenue increase in the second half is seasonally related. The other third is we\u2019re expecting stronger markets for automotive, commercial, aerospace, industrial.", "And then another third is we have some significant new product launches, particularly in our Consumer and Fiber businesses, Network businesses. And I think the key point is at the margin rate we\u2019re delivering now, we\u2019ve continued to improve operating leverage.", "So please turn to slide 15. Before we move to Q&A, I wanted to review the three scenarios I laid out for fiscal 2013 on the last call. And these scenarios really summarize how expect to perform at different sales levels, which I think is important to understand. To recap, at the low end scenario, revenue would be flat year-over-year and we expected to generate about 5% adjusted EPS growth as a result of productivity improvements and the benefit of share repurchases.", "The midpoint scenario assumed 3% sales growth with a modest economic pickup beginning in second half and adjusted EPS growth of approximately 10%. And at the high end of the range, a stronger recovery in the second half was assumed with sales growth of 5% and EPS growth of 15%.", "So, what happened in the first three months of the year, sales in the first quarter were slightly lower than expected. Margins were stronger due to the increasing impact of our productivity programs and cost and spending controls. Free cash flow continued to be very strong and it was in fact stronger than anticipated. And order rates did improve through the quarter in the vast majority of our businesses.", "So when we take that all in and all the data points in the macro world, these results in current order trends lead us to a view for the remainder of the year that anticipates revenue at the low to midpoint of prior guidance, and adjusted EPS at the midpoint.", "Revenue levels remains tough to predict in this environment. But on the positive side, we\u2019ve got off to a great start with our productivity and cost reduction initiatives. And we expect to carry this through the balance of the year. We expect another strong year of cash flow and expect to return over $1 billion in capital to our shareholders this year.", "As Bob mentioned earlier, we continue to expect $150 million to $250 million of share repurchase a quarter in fiscal 2013. And in addition, our board has recommended a 19% increase in the dividend to $1 per year. This increase would be effective with the June quarter and is subject to shareholder approval at the March annual meeting.", "So again, I think the bottom line for us is our strong cash flow and improving operating leverage should enable us to deliver very attractive earnings growth even at a low sales growth rate. So with that, let\u2019s open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Of course. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Good morning, guys. Just a question, I guess, on the Automotive segment. If you could maybe talk about the softness that you saw in the December quarter, specifically in EMEA. This was more demand driven or do you think there\u2019s an inventory correction that\u2019s occurring over there that could persist over the next couple of quarters especially related to dealer registered vehicles, if you may? Maybe if you could just talk about that part of the business and the inventory correction, that\u2019ll be helpful.", "Tom Lynch", "Sure. I think in the Automotive piece, it\u2019s more demand-driven, Amit, to your point about the low new registrations. That\u2019s offset a little bit by the fact that the high end, half the cars there are being exported to other parts of world. Where in China and the U.S. where the economies are picking up again, we didn\u2019t see too much inventory.", "I think inventory in auto chain, value chain or supply chain is in good shape. We did see some inventory corrections the last couple quarters in the industrial vehicle market. But now, we\u2019re starting to see that turn around. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s how I would summarize it.", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Got it. And so the expectation would be that that segment or that automotive in general should improve as you go forward through fiscal 2013, right, on a revenue basis?", "Tom Lynch", "Yes.", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "And then as a follow up, if we\u2019re just talking about the Industrial segment, can you just touch on the margin declines? You said it was fairly severe on a sequential and year-over-year basis. Maybe you could just talk about what happened there. And more importantly, the path to go back to 15% margin in that segment, is that going to be more revenue driven or do you think some of these cost takeout initiatives you have could help out that segment, especially in the back half of fiscal 2013? Thank you.", "Tom Lynch", "Okay. To answer the second part of your question first, it\u2019ll be both revenue and cost, which the cost piece is well underway. The drop-off, that\u2019s in high margin items. I mean that\u2019s a business that\u2019s over 50% through the channel into the industrial equipment portion of our Industrial Solution segment. So that tends to be very high margin.", "But we are seeing signs that the channel\u2019s starting to replenish. We need to see a little more of that before we\u2019ll move from cautiously optimistic to bullish. But it has a, I guess you could use the word mix to describe it. It\u2019s just high margin business that dropped off.", "And then coupled with the solar business that was twice the size it is today a year ago because of everything that went on with the shift to China and then the ultimate significant collapse of the business. But I\u2019m pretty confident of our ability to drive the margins back up to near company average or company goal over the next four or five quarters.", "Operator", "And we do have a question from the line of Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.", "Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research", "Hi. I wanted to focus in on, I guess, the cost profile, both the savings generated this quarter from raw materials and efficiency gains and kind of what you have left there. And then also, the accelerated restructuring program at $225 million this year, what does that mean for restructuring savings for fiscal 2013?", "Tom Lynch", "Shawn, I guess the second question, the $225 million restructuring, we begin to get a little bit at the end of the year. But most of this doesn\u2019t start to hit until next year, given the nature of plant realignment and shut down and things like that. So for example, we\u2019ve announced about half of them already, which is where we spent the $100 million.", "Now, once you announce, we need to move equipment, transition it to the receiving plant. Then that will typically take some time of the year. So as we said last quarter, we didn\u2019t really expect to see too much benefit, maybe a little. I mean, we\u2019re pushing and accelerating very hard and maybe get a little bit at the very tail end of the year.", "Bob Hau", "Shawn, the other aspect, you heard Tom say the restructuring charge for fiscal 2013 prior guidance was $200 million, now $225 million. So not only are we accelerating the actions we had already kind of laid out, but there\u2019s a slight increase in the restructuring charge and the actions we\u2019re taking.", "That will translate into about $85 million worth of annual savings. We had previously said we\u2019d see $75 million of annual savings as we exited 2014, so full year benefit in 2015. That $75 million is now $85 million. So there\u2019s a higher return from the increased spending.", "Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research", "In the raw material savings you saw this quarter, I mean, do you think you\u2019ve eked out as much as you can from that or will you see more benefits as the year goes?", "Tom Lynch", "I think we\u2019ll see more benefit. That was a nice contribution to our gross margin. It\u2019s a program that\u2019s been \u2013 we call the war on material. It\u2019s been driven hard for several years here and it includes everything from upgrading the capabilities of the organization to how we design products to faster localizing of material sources.", "And over the last couple of quarters, all that have heavy lifting really started to come into fruition. So I would expect to continue to see this level of productivity through the balance of the year. And it\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019re optimistic about the ability to improve margins over the balance of the year.", "Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research", "And then just as a follow up, Network Solutions, taking maybe a little more bearish view. If I exclude the Subsea business coming back in the second half and the broadband project, what gives you confidence that the business bounces back over the next 12 months to 18 months? I know you\u2019re taking more restructuring charges, but I just didn\u2019t get a good sense today that you have maybe a lot of confidence in that bouncing back.", "Tom Lynch", "I thought we\u2019d have more confidence by now. But it\u2019s not quite where I\u2019d like to be to your point, Shawn. We\u2019re seeing signs. You need to go around the world. So in the emerging markets, there\u2019s still double-digit growth. Pockets of growth in Europe. I think the U.S. finally had a little bit of growth in the first quarter in our revenue, which says that some of the investment is moving back into the wireline.", "Really, a lot of spending has been around expanding capacity on existing towers and then just deploying LTE, of which we don\u2019t participate that much in our Network business. I think the next phase, which we thought would happen a little faster, I think is taking a little longer, which is pushing small base stations out and further near the home or the office because they\u2019re not going to be building that many more towers.", "And those base stations, there\u2019s going to be a lot of fiber connectivity to that. And then, we believe \u2013 you see what some of the carriers around the world are doing. They\u2019re upping the bandwidth. They\u2019re providing to the home and it is a way to raise the price. So, we haven\u2019t changed our view on the underlying thesis of this business, which is you got to have the bandwidth.", "And over time, that fiber is going to continue to get closer to home. But it has taken longer than we thought. So, we think a little bit of an uptick by late this year, but we\u2019re not counting on anything. Not about, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s about. It\u2019s just sort of a gradual pickup. That\u2019s our current projection.", "Operator", "And we do have a question from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Hi. Thank you. I don\u2019t know if I missed it. But did you give the number of orders this quarter?", "Bob Hau", "I think we did.", "Tom Lynch", "We said that our book-to-bill was 1.02 for the quarter excluding SubCom.", "Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "But you didn\u2019t...", "Bob Hau", "And $3.1 billion.", "Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then just looking at the order rates, it seems like everything is improving with the exception of networking. Just wanted to get a sense of where you seeing improvements throughout the quarter and do you think you\u2019ll see consistent improvements in orders as we move through the year in all the segments? Maybe a little more detail on the segment areas. Thanks.", "Tom Lynch", "Yes. That is our current view that starting with Transportation, I mean, not big increases, because it\u2019s running pretty strong right now, but a pickup. I think the industry is forecasting 1 million more cars queued first half, second half. So that\u2019s a little lift in the business first half and second half. We are seeing signs talking to our big OEM customers in the Industrial business and the distributors.", "We\u2019re seeing orders for distribution pickup. But I think once everybody got through sort of the first wave of January uncertainty in D.C., we did see orders pickup. So four out of our last six weeks, you take the two holiday weeks out, orders had a lot of \u2013 were pretty robust, which was more than in prior years at that time of the year because it\u2019s going to be a pretty soft time. And often at times, it\u2019s very hard to call.", "So then you go into the Consumer business. We definitely have nice momentum albeit we\u2019re still small in tablets and smartphones. But we have more designs than we did last year at this time. We\u2019re executing them well. So those orders are picking up. PC is going down, but I would expect Consumer business will gradually ramp. The second half should be higher than the first half that we have some significant new products we\u2019re launching there.", "The balance of industrial energy expected to be steady. It\u2019s been a little slow particularly in Europe, but staring to see signs that that\u2019s loosening up a little bit. And that\u2019s a very seasonal business. So as we go into \u2013 coming out of the second quarter and go into third quarter, our Telecom and Energy businesses pick up because they\u2019re outside businesses. So there is a typical kick to that.", "So there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s probably the biggest jump from first half to second half at SubCom. We have all the awards. It\u2019s just those awards working through the funding. And of course, that\u2019s the business where we can jump the most. So I think it\u2019s pretty balanced. With Networks showing the lowest growth, I think we\u2019re not bearish, but we\u2019re conservative, I hope.", "Operator", "And we do have a question from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Please go ahead.", "Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research", "Thank you. Good morning. Two questions. First of all on the Consumer segment. I believe you just did 9% margins in that segment, which is a nice recovery. Tom, given all the product shifts that you mentioned for the next few quarters, what does that imply for the Consumer margins going forward and where could they go, maybe longer term? And then secondly, you mentioned one-third of the second half recovery would be around new products. I was wondering if we could get some key examples of what you\u2019re referring to there. Thanks.", "Tom Lynch", "Sure. We would expect Consumer had a nice pickup from, of course nowhere to go but up you could say, from this time last year to 9%. And really, well-run to get there launching new products and we mentioned before new team. Our expectation is to pick up another point or two in the operating margin through the year. So the target is at the end of the year in double-digits in this business.", "We believe when we model it \u2013 and it is in many ways the hardest to predict business because the cycles are the shortest. We do have a nice infrastructure in Asia to support this business. So it\u2019s low cost infrastructure. Most of our leadership team is there. So we\u2019re on the ground close to the customer.", "We believe this can be low double-digits, nice return on capital, nice earnings growth model. We would expect this business to grow, core organic growth to be higher than the other businesses, part of that because of the share and part of it the nature of the growth of smartphones and tablets, et cetera. So I\u2019d say the important thing for us in this business is to get double-digit margin by the end of the year.", "Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research", "And then just on the new products?", "Tom Lynch", "The second part of your question was new products?", "Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research", "Yes, just sort of examples of what you were referring to in terms of helping the second half?", "Tom Lynch", "You can imagine we can\u2019t get into too much. But look, we\u2019re really focused on miniaturization in the connector space. So high speed, really high speed, high performing, high reliable cables and then flexible antennas, so that they\u2019re design friendly for the device designer.", "So those are the three big things and we have new products coming in all those. We\u2019ve launched some new products in the first half as well. But we have another round of that coming in the second half that has some potentially higher revenue associated with it if we execute and the demand for the end products are there.", "Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research", "Great, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.", "Tom Lynch", "Sure.", "Operator", "We do have a question from the line of Amitabh Passi with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS", "Hi. Thank you. Bob, just a clarification. It looks like the implied EPS for the back half of the year is about $0.90 a quarter versus the $0.65 and $0.70 in the first half. You may have touched on this. Just curious how do you see that ramp in the back half and that seems like implied operating margins would be almost kind of in the mid 30%s?", "Bob Hau", "See, you\u2019re correct, about $0.90 per quarter in the back half. And that\u2019s really driven by a combination of the seasonal growth that we typically see an outsized portion of our earnings in the second half of the year, given the sales growth that we see driven by seasonality plus the new products that Tom talked about.", "The other benefit we have is in our cost reduction programs whether it\u2019s our Lean efforts with the TEOA, TE Operating Advantage, our war on material that we talked about earlier in getting both raw and component, material costs down on a year-over-year basis. We continue to accelerate that. And of course, the accelerated restructuring as well as a slight increase in restructuring all benefit us as we enter the second half of the year.", "Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS", "Got it. And then just a follow up for you Tom, you touched on Network Solutions. You talked about the potential small cell opportunity. We\u2019ve also heard some updates from AT&T, Deutsche Telekom. Just wondering, what kind of visibility do you have into any sort of potential bills with these two large operators? And any sense of timing? Do you think they\u2019re more a 2014 type event? Do you think you could see some benefit this year? Just some thoughts around at least some of the more publicly announced updates from some of the larger carriers.", "Tom Lynch", "Well, there\u2019s been definitely big announcements of total amounts of spending. And then you got at the doubles in the details where it\u2019s going to be spent.", "Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS", "Correct.", "Tom Lynch", "I think for us, we would expect a slight increase in spending in the U.S. in our section of the network. And probably a little more than that in Germany, but it is a carrier by carrier. We really have to go carrier by carrier. I\u2019d say in the greenfield, building fiber quickly.", "In the U.S., it went through a significant investment in the sort of three to five years ago, pushing for the traditional telcos, pushing fiber and video on that fiber close to the home or to the home depending on the operator and then a lull there. But now, we see the pickup. And the carriers in the U.S. are talking about significantly increasing speeds. I think that\u2019s the best news for us because that puts the pressure on everybody else.", "And as you get to 200 megabits, 300 megabits, that people are talking about and even in some of these experimental systems, they\u2019re being built at a gigabit, you really got to bring fiber right to the home. So I mean, we\u2019re very bullish. We\u2019ve been off on the timing. We\u2019re adjusting the cost structure accordingly, but we continue to be bullish on that.", "It only takes a couple of these operators to really drive it deep because then they begin to deliver quite a different experience for the consumer. And it enabled a lot different experience. And so, that typically, based on my history in the cable industry, that typically will lead to everybody getting more aggressive. But all of our customer have to figure out their business model. And I think...", "Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS", "Are there any regulatory hurdles that you think need to be cleared, both in Germany and the U.S., for deployments to accelerate?", "Tom Lynch", "I don\u2019t think anything significant now, not that I\u2019m aware of.", "Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS", "Okay. Thank you.", "Tom Lynch", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "And we do have a question from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.", "Matt Sheerin \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Yes, thanks. Good morning. Just a question regarding the accelerated restructuring program, could you be more specific about the areas? I know you talked about Networking, Industrial, Consumer. Could you parse that out? And on the Networking business, is that where you taking the biggest cut? Because with the pressed revenue, even ex-Subsea, trying to figure out what revenue run rate you need to get to get back to double-digit operating margin?", "Tom Lynch", "As we laid out last time, Matt, it hasn\u2019t changed that much. We just found more. Let\u2019s say that\u2019s really the \u2013 we\u2019re digging for every opportunity. And three more months went by and we identified another $25 million investment with a pretty good payback. And it\u2019s going to be primarily in the Networks and Consumer.", "I think it\u2019s fine-tuning in Industrial. There\u2019s some difficult work there to get the footprint in order and rebalance. But fundamentally, those businesses are pretty healthy. And we\u2019re pretty confident as the revenue comes back, we have significant operating leverage. But when you look at the margin levels of Consumer and Network, we needed to take a lot of cost out. And we found it and we think we can do it without really mortgaging the upside of revenue.", "So I think we\u2019ll run in, I believe, around 3.4% annual somewhere for that segment. We probably need to get, let\u2019s say, into the \u2013 3.2% rather. We\u2019re running about 3.2%. We probably need to get to 3.4%, 3.5% to get to the double-digit. I would expect at 3.6%, we should be somewhere in the 12% to 13% range.", "There\u2019s a lot of leverage in the \u2013 it\u2019s high gross margin business in Network. And it\u2019ll be higher with the costs we\u2019re taking out and the synergies that we continue to extract across all the businesses. And one of the reasons we put those four businesses together because they all basically are in the same industry and in many cases touching the same customers. So the goal was to become much more efficient than they were grouped in other segments.", "Matt Sheerin \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Got it. And on the use of cash, you talked about the dividend and buybacks, not much mentioned on acquisitions. I know in the last couple of quarters, you\u2019ve talked about doing niche sort of tuck-in deals, nothing really big. Is that still part of the strategy and any specific areas where you\u2019re looking to fill voids?", "Tom Lynch", "We really haven\u2019t changed our strategy. If you could find the right opportunity at the right price, we would like to be bigger in energy and industrial. They\u2019re really good businesses. They play to our strength, highly engineered, high quality, reliability, got to last the life of the piece of equipment. I mean that\u2019s what we do best.", "So we have a number of opportunities that we\u2019re looking at. But there\u2019s nothing really even warm, I would say. And also to ourselves, we want to make sure we fully capitalize on Deutsch. I feel very good about the integration on that. So we\u2019re careful. Let\u2019s get that under our belt and running well before we would do anything else. I mean, we\u2019re looking and knocking though.", "Matt Sheerin \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And we do have a question from the line of Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Jim Suva \u2013 Citi", "Thank you very much and congratulations to you and your team there at TE Connectivity. I have two questions. The first one is on the Networking. Can you talk to us a little bit more about your confidence in that? Like are there carriers giving you roadmaps for the small base stations? Because it just seems like the whole LTE upgrade cycle so far, you guys are not positioned to capture that.", "So are you actually getting firm orders from that or is that hypothetical which you foresee happening? It just seems like this segment continues to disappoint. And so, I\u2019m just trying to get the disconnect about why it\u2019s not coming to fruition.", "Tom Lynch", "I wouldn\u2019t use the work hypothetical, Jim. But I would say it\u2019s still at the architecture stage. And so there isn\u2019t really much. What\u2019s being deployed that\u2019s called small base stations today are these digital antenna systems. But that\u2019s not really what the carriers and the equipment providers are really thinking when they say small base stations. So, small base stations are on the drawing board, in test pilots in the field. But it\u2019s not being deployed, I would say, yet.", "Jim Suva \u2013 Citi", "And what\u2019s typical timeline for deployment of that?", "Tom Lynch", "Well, I think when it starts, it\u2019s going to be a long drawn out deployment because you\u2019re talking about really taking these base stations almost like cable amplifiers today. Now, you see, for every so many houses you have a green or brown box that has a cable amplifier in it. I mean that\u2019s almost what a small base station is. It\u2019s getting something to repower the \u2013 boost the signal close to your house.", "Today, the only thing you really have are the towers. And they\u2019re running out of capacity with all the data that\u2019s going through them. And as you know that it\u2019s not very easy to get a new tower built. But I would expect it to be a long deployment as small base stations get rolled out. I mean, as I said, what we\u2019re selling right now and we\u2019re seeing a little pickup is more the traditional backhaul, more up the \u2013 there\u2019s more fiber going up.", "The current towers and antennas, they\u2019re switching off slowly from coax. So, there\u2019s changes in the network that way that we\u2019re benefiting from. But I mean, the big one for us is when fiber to the home continues to pick up. And it is in different pockets around the world. It\u2019s just not broadly deployed and small base stations get deployed. That\u2019s when we would expect to see a nice pop in our demand.", "Jim Suva \u2013 Citi", "Great. And then my follow-up question is on the operating margin. I believe you had kind of a goal of 15% and there were certain revenue metrics of when you thought you\u2019d hit that as well as the timeline of hitting that 15%. Can you just refresh my memory on that?", "Tom Lynch", "Sure, Jim. I think right now, we feel in the $15 billion revenue range down a little bit from what we\u2019ve said. That part of the goal or the restructuring to accelerate that. And if we can do it faster, we will without upsetting the apple cart. But think about it as 15% in the $15 billion range. Six months ago, we were talking about $15 billion to $16 billion range. So we\u2019re pulling that in.", "Jim Suva \u2013 Citi", "And then the timeline?", "Tom Lynch", "Well, if you to take our forecast, let\u2019s say, it would probably be sometime late next year you\u2019d start getting at a $15-million run rate.", "Jim Suva \u2013 Citi", "Thank you and congratulations to you and your team at TE Connectivity.", "Tom Lynch", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We do have a question from line Anthony Kure with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.", "Anthony Kure \u2013 KeyBanc", "Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just a couple of quick questions. First, on the book-to-bill as it relates to the different segments specifically on the Consumer side. Can you just speak to \u2013 given the shorter cycle nature of Consumer products, does the first quarter book-to-bill reflect second quarter revenue only or is the order book here have a long review than the shorter cycle nature of Consumer products?", "Tom Lynch", "I would say, Anthony, generally it would reflect \u2013 it\u2019s a good indicator of the quarter to come. We did see in Q1. And part of the reason we were a little down on sales because with this kind of book-to-bill, we would have expected to be in the sales range for Q1. So, what we did see was a little more scheduling out of orders.", "And it was almost a phenomenon of, look, I want to get in line. The customer is saying I want to get in line for the order, but I don\u2019t really necessarily want to take it in early January depending \u2013 could something, the fiscal cliff, et cetera. I think just that extra uncertainty and so trying to protect themselves. So that would explain to me a little bit of the book-to-bill.", "So the encouraging thing is in January, we\u2019ve seen the book-to-bill get even stronger. So I think if it would\u2019ve turned down, that would have said that would just a pushing out of orders. We\u2019re really at a different order rate and we\u2019re not seeing that much for the second quarter. So Consumer itself, I would say, generally is indicative of the next quarter generally.", "Anthony Kure \u2013 KeyBanc", "Okay. So it doesn\u2019t reflect then the new products that are coming online in the second half?", "Tom Lynch", "Only the new \u2013 yes, not the new products in the second half, no. There\u2019s no orders in for that.", "Anthony Kure \u2013 KeyBanc", "Okay. And then my follow-up is just on a little bit more on the Consumer. You mentioned obviously the puts and takes within the business itself, PC being weaker. Can you just remind us what the weighting is PC versus smartphone and tablets for that business?", "Tom Lynch", "Bob, take that out real quick here.", "Bob Hau", "PC is about 35% of the business. Mobile and tablet is about 45%. And then the remainder would be business equipment, those types of things.", "Tom Lynch", "And in business equipment, it\u2019s everything from cameras to copiers to Nintendo and things like that.", "Bob Hau", "And those will be the percentages for the Consumer Devices business within the Consumer Solutions segment.", "Anthony Kure \u2013 KeyBanc", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Bob Hau", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "We do have a question from the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie. Please go ahead.", "Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie", "Hi. Good morning.", "Tom Lynch", "Good morning.", "Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie", "The outperformance to global vehicle production that you\u2019re expecting for 2013, can you provide some color on your visibility to that and the main drivers whether it\u2019s luxury vehicle outperformance or content growth?", "Tom Lynch", "I\u2019ll make sure I understand your question, Mike. Our outperformance of the vehicles, you mean us growing faster than...", "Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie", "Global auto production, correct?", "Tom Lynch", "Yes. Well, I think there\u2019s a couple of things there. There is the electronic content. So if production is growing 1% or 2%, you\u2019re going to have anywhere depending on the mix of cars in the world anywhere from 3% to 5% of content. Then you\u2019re going to have a couple percent of price erosion. And it is different region by region. So if production is going up, you would expect our revenue to go up a little more than the production numbers.", "And then I think we have had a strong performance, continuing to gain share in places like China and the U.S. where we really invested in both places in the downturn. And because of the fragile nature, a lot of supply chains at those times we\u2019re able to garner a little more business. So that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been tracking \u2013 those three things have been why we\u2019re tracking slightly ahead.", "Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie", "Okay. And does the $125 million SubCom quarterly sales pace that you\u2019re expecting in the second half, is that more of a chunky drawdown of some of this shadow pipeline or is that more of a sustainable pace that we should expect heading into your next fiscal year?", "Tom Lynch", "Right now, we would say that\u2019s more of a sustainable pace. In the past when we\u2019ve seen this kind of pipeline, it\u2019s usually a signal that we\u2019re going back into an up-cycle. But we need to see that start to happen. So I think that some of these projects break loose in the next two quarters.", "That\u2019s going to tell us a lot that this cycle really is starting to recover or is it going to stay on the bottom. I think we have enough signs that we\u2019re starting to see recovery. And then what will the slope be. Will we go back into another boom or will we go into a more steady build cycle? And that\u2019s really the call.", "Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie", "Got it. Thank you.", "Tom Lynch", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "And we do have no further questions in queue at this time. Please continue.", "Keith Kolstrom", "Thanks everybody. We appreciate the questions as always and have a good week.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

Hillier - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Mike Wood - Macquarie Research", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the TE Connectivity Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Keith Kolstrom, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Keith Kolstrom", "Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's second quarter 2013 results. With me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch; and Chief Financial Officer, Bob Hau.", "During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information, and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning, and we ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items. The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com. [Operator Instructions]", "Now let me turn the call over to Tom for some opening comments.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone.", "Please turn to Slide 3. I'm pleased with our overall performance in this quarter. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.76 was a record for the second quarter and $0.06 above the midpoint of our guidance. Sales of $3.27 billion were in line with expectations. Adjusted OI margin of 13.6% was up 60 basis points versus the prior year and up 120 basis points sequentially.", "We generated $353 million of free cash flow and during the quarter returned $319 million of capital to shareholders through dividends of $88 million and share repurchases of $231 million, giving us a total share repurchase of about $409 million in the first half. The strong OI performance -- OI margin performance is another step towards delivering 15% margins at the $15 billion revenue level.", "Our favorable earnings performance was due to higher revenue and strong margin results in our Transportation segment and continued productivity and momentum across the company. Orders were $3.4 billion in the quarter, up 4% versus the prior year and up 9% sequentially. Book-to-bill, excluding SubCom, was 1.06 and was above 1 in all 4 of our segments. This is a reference point, book-to-bill in our first quarter was 1.02.", "The economy does continue to send mixed signals, but based on our order trends, we continue to expect a strong second half due to the normal seasonal pickup, improvements in the industrial and telecom markets and strong productivity performance.", "For the full year, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $3.10 to $3.22 on sales of $13.075 billion to $13.375 billion. Earnings per share was up slightly from our guidance last quarter. The outlook in our Transportation segment has strengthened. It's more than offsetting foreign exchange headwinds and a reduced outlook in our networks business in the second half compared to the prior forecast.", "Please turn to Slide 4. Total company sales of $3.27 billion were in line with our expectations, as I previously mentioned. On a geographic basis, sales in the Americas were up 5%, excluding SubCom, due to another quarter of strong U.S. automotive demand and the Deutsche acquisition. This more than offset continued softness in networks and industrial.", "In Europe, sales were up 2%, again due to the Deutsche acquisition, which more than offset the weakness in those markets in our industrial networks markets. Our automotive sales in Europe were down about 1% versus the prior year on a decline in European auto production. Asia sales were down slightly in the quarter. Growth in China and Korea was more than offset by weakness in Japan. Strong performance in our Transportation segment and the addition of Deutsche more than offset weaker networks revenue and foreign exchange headwind.", "Please turn to Slide 5, and I'll provide some highlights of our segment performance. We had another very strong quarter in our Transportation segment. Sales were up 9% and adjusted operating income was up 31% due to increased organic revenue, the addition of Deutsche and very strong operating performance. The strong performance was in spite of a slight decline in global vehicle production around the world.", "On a regional basis, vehicle production remained strong in North America and it's picking up again in China. This offset weakness in Europe and Japan. Another important development was an increase in demand for industrial and commercial vehicles, primarily driven by demand for heavy trucks in the U.S. and China. The Deutsche acquisition is serving us very well in these markets. We expect continued strong results in the second half, with quarterly results similar to the Q2 levels.", "Please turn to Slide 6. Results on our network segment were down 11% versus the prior year, down 8% excluding the SubCom business, which is very soft right now. This resulted in about a $30 million decline in operating income. Demand across our networks businesses continues to be slower than we anticipated. We are seeing additional project activity in our telecom and SubCom businesses and feel we are well positioned to capitalize on these when these projects come into force. We have reduced our second half outlook in this segment, but do expect to improve our adjusted operating margin to the high single digit range exiting the year.", "Please turn to Slide 7. Revenue in the industrial segment was up 4%, in line with expectations, as the addition of Deutsche and continued strength in commercial aerospace and oil and gas markets offset weak demand in the industrial equipment and energy market. Organically, sales were down 7%, as expected. Adjusted operating margins were up 170 basis points sequentially, but below prior levels due to the decline in organic sales. Orders were up 10% sequentially, and we continue to expect sequential sales and margin improvement over the balance of the year.", "Now please turn to Slide 8. Sales on our consumer segment were down 7% from the prior year, largely in line with our outlook. Weakness in the PC market, still our largest devices market and a slow but gradually improving appliance market more than offset our improving position in tablets and smartphones. We do continue to be very selective about the projects we are going after in the consumer markets. In addition, we are seeing some delays in customer programs, and as result, we have reduced our second half outlook in this segment. Despite the sales decline, we continue to improve profitability in this segment and expect adjusted operating margins to be around 10% as we exit the fiscal year.", "Now I'll turn it over to Bob, who will cover the financials in more detail.", "Robert W. Hau", "Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Let me discuss earnings, which start on Slide 9. Our GAAP operating income for the quarter was $359 million, which includes restructuring charges of $78 million and Deutsche acquisition-related charges of $6 million. We now expect a total of approximately $275 million of restructuring charges for the full year, an increase of about $50 million versus prior guidance. We are increasing our restructuring spending in 2013 and expect a substantial reduction on our level of restructuring actions next year.", "Our adjusted operating income was $443 million, with an adjusted operating margin of 13.6%, up 60 basis points from Q2 last year. Our adjusted EPS was $0.76 and GAAP EPS were $0.66 for the quarter. GAAP EPS included $0.13 of restructuring and other charges and $0.01 of acquisition-related charges, partially offset by $0.03 of income-related tax items. The tax income was primarily associated with the expiration of statutes of limitations related to non-U.S. tax audit periods.", "Turning to Slide 10. Our adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 32.2%. This is an 80-basis-point increase versus the prior year on relatively flat sales as a result of continued progress on our TEOA programs that's driving increased productivity and cost reductions. As you know, TEOA is our version of lean and is delivering results across the business.", "Total OpEx spending was $609 million in the quarter, up slightly versus the prior year. Increased expenses related to the addition of Deutsche were mostly offset by cost reduction and productivity initiatives. The right side of the slide details items on the P&L below the operating line. Net interest expense was $30 million in the second quarter, and I expect approximately $32 million of expense per quarter for the remainder of the year. Adjusted other income, which relates to our tax-sharing agreement, was $8 million, in line with guidance. The adjusted effective tax rate was 23%, which was at the low end of our guidance of 23% to 24%. And for the remainder of the year, I expect other income of about $8 million per quarter and the tax rate to be 23% to 24%.", "Turning to Slide 11, I'll discuss our balance sheet and free cash flow. Cash flow from continuing operations was $446 million, and our free cash flow in Q2 was $353 million. We continue to expect free cash flow to approximate net income going forward. Capital spending during the quarter was $125 million or about 4% of sales. This is consistent with our anticipated spending rate of approximately 4% to 5% of sales going forward. Receivable days outstanding were 61 days and inventory days on hand were 71 days. We work to reduce working capital levels following the Deutsche acquisition, and they are now in line with our expectations.", "Now let me discuss sources and uses of cash outside of free cash flow shown on the right side of the slide. We began the quarter with $1 billion of cash and ended the quarter with about $1.1 billion. During the quarter, we returned a total of $319 million to shareholders, we paid dividends of $88 million and repurchased about 5.7 million shares for $231 million. The cash flow statement shows a lower dollar amount for share repurchases due to a timing of difference on actual payment of funds. Beginning in the June quarter, dividend paid increased by approximately 19% to an annualized rate of $1 per share. We continue to expect additional share repurchases of $150 million to $250 million per quarter for the remainder of fiscal 2013. Outstanding debt was $3 billion at the end of the quarter, and we expect similar levels for the remainder of the fiscal year 2013.", "Now I'll turn it back to Tom.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Thanks, Bob. Please turn to Slide 12. Orders were up 9% versus the first quarter, and our book to bill was 1.06, excluding Subsea. All segments had a positive book to bill, as I mentioned earlier. And in the Transportation, industrial and network segments, orders were all up about 10% sequentially or more. Although, as I mentioned, networks -- the increase in networks was lower than expected. Orders were down slightly in Consumer.", "Please turn to Slide 13. Based on our order trends, we expect revenue in Q3 to be in the $3.325 billion to $3.425 billion range, and adjusted EPS in the $0.80 to $0.84 range. We expect adjusted EPS to be up approximately 4% versus the prior year due to improved productivity, cost reduction and our share repurchase program. Revenue is expected to be up sequentially, with growth in all segments. Versus the prior year, revenue will be down about 4% as weaker demand in networks and Consumer, coupled with the weaker euro and yen more than offsets growth in our Transportation segment.", "Please turn to Slide 14. For the full year, we expect sales in the range of $13.075 billion to $13.375 billion, and adjusted EPS of $3.10 to $3.22. As I mentioned earlier, our adjusted EPS outlook is up slightly at the midpoint compared to what we guided last quarter, primarily due to our strong Q2 performance. This, coupled with continued strong performance in our Transportation business, is more than offsetting foreign exchange headwinds to about $0.05 per share in the second half and a reduced outlook in our networks and Consumer businesses. This full year outlook represents a strong improvement sequentially in the second half, as adjusted EPS versus the first half will be up in the range of 28% -- 20% to 28%. This is driven due to the sales increase of 4% to 9%, improved productivity and reduced share count.", "Let me make a few comments about the range and put it in perspective. The midpoint scenario assumes revenue about flat with the prior year, with a modest economic pickup beginning in the second half and adjusted EPS growth of approximately 10% overall. The high end of the range would be a 1% sales increase, driven largely by a stronger recovery in the second half, particularly in our industrial and networks business. Adjusted EPS growth would then be about 13%. At the low end, revenue would be down about 2%, and we would expect to generate about 8% adjusted EPS growth for the year as a result of productivity improvements and the benefit of share repurchases.", "In summary, we had a strong Q2 and expect to deliver a strong second half, with second half adjusted operating margins above 14%. And for the year, we expect to deliver adjusted EPS up 10% versus the prior year. Our key assumptions for the second half: Global auto production expected to be up slightly in the second half, and Industrial Transportation demand increasing, particularly in the heavy truck area, the trend we're already seeing. Networks and Industrial demand -- Industrial Equipment demand is improving versus the first half level, but it still does remain slightly below last year's second half.", "SubCom revenue is expected to be up about 100 -- up to $100 million in Q3, that's an absolute level of $100 million in Q3 and return to about $125 million in Q4. In Q2, we ran $80 million, which is a low point in many years. And we expect continued margin improvement to our -- due to our lean programs and the acceleration of our cost improvement actions. And as I mentioned, we expect to deliver 14% plus operating margin in the second half.", "For the full year, we expect free cash flow of about $1.3 billion. And as we pointed out last quarter, we expect to return in excess of $1 billion of capital to shareholders.", "So with that, can we please open it up for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll go to Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Ruplu Bhattacharya", "This is Ruplu filling in for Wamsi today. Just wanted to start by asking you about the Transportation segment margins, very good performance. Just wondering, was that more seasonal, maybe because of commercial vehicle market picking up? And how do you see that progressing as we go forward in the second half of the year?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Thanks, Ruplu, a couple of things. Not so much seasonal, but I would say the pickup in commercial vehicles, that which, as you recall, really was soft last year, especially in the second half, has nice leverage on the margins. And the Deutsche business that we brought in has very strong margins. They're very highly engineered products that operate in very difficult environments, and they do command nice margins. So that's the biggest thing, as well as just continued strong execution. And with the 3% organic growth in the light vehicle, bringing that flow through to the bottom line.", "Ruplu Bhattacharya", "Okay. And just looking at the book-to-bill numbers, I mean, they're again very strong. How have they trended so far in this quarter, in the third quarter?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "The trend is continuing to be about that level through the first 3 weeks of April. So continuing what we saw build through the second quarter so far.", "Ruplu Bhattacharya", "And the last one for me, Bob, I think you mentioned the $50 million more in restructuring. I was just wondering if you could give some more details on which segments that this is targeting and when do you expect to see the benefits from that?", "Robert W. Hau", "Yes, the -- as far as the targeted segment, consistent with what we've seen really in the first half of the year, networks in particular, but also industrial and commercial -- or excuse me, Consumer, a little bit less obviously in our Transportation segment. In terms of benefit, we had indicated about $85 million of run rate benefit in 2015 from the $225 million. That number is now closer to about $100 million given the increased activity in that this year.", "Operator", "And we'll go to Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Just 2 questions for me. One, maybe just from a back to the Transportation side, the margin performance you guys had this quarter was at an all-time high, I believe. Maybe could you just talk about how sustainable that level is if revenues remain flattish? And then in addition, if you look at the European production data, it's been a lot more robust or declining at least less than what the registration numbers have suggested. So do you think that, that could end up in resulting in a more severe back half than what you guys are forecasting, assumptions being there might be an inventory build there? So just any thoughts on that would be helpful as well.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Sure. Regarding the Transportation margin, the Industrial and Commercial vehicle, because of the Deutsche acquisition, is a bigger part of that business now. So we basically doubled the size of our industrial commercial business with that acquisition, and those margins are higher than the segment average. So that's giving us nice leverage, which we expected. And we've improved those margins. We're actually running them slightly ahead on the cost synergies that were the goals that we set out when we did that acquisition. So that's helping. Regarding the European registration, a significant part of the Northern European auto production is exported. So the strength in the U.S. and China, you're going to look at those OEMs and their revenues aren't going to track exactly to the European registration for that reason. And most of the decline -- the severe decline is in the South. So we think we've got this all reflected in our outlook. And our second half is really -- I think I touched on, we continue to expect the U.S. market to be solid. China, after a slowdown last year, is picking up, we saw that in the first 2 quarters. And we continue to expect Europe to be soft.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Got it. That's really helpful. And then if I just look at the fiscal year guidance, I want to just make sure I understand this, you're basically lowering your full year revenues by $275 million or so, which you had 90 days ago. But it looks like about $165 million of that is really FX driven. Should we be talking about what the rest of that $110 million downtick is driven by? And then if my math is right, versus the 90-day guide that you had, that $165 million is a $0.04, $0.05 EPS hit, which means had you not had FX, you actually could have raised the midpoint by $0.06 rather than $0.01, is that accurate?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Yes, yes and yes. I think you got the numbers right quickly. And as far as of the rest of the revenue decline, it's mostly in networks. SubCom continues to be slow. We are seeing -- we're seeing the seasonal pickup but we're not seeing it as much as we expected, I would say, in any of our networks businesses. So second half will be better than first half. Orders picked up, as I mentioned, in the second quarter versus the first quarter, but not as robust as we had originally. I think when you dig inside things, both SubCom and telecom have a lot of project activity, which is encouraging. I'd be a little more concerned if the project activity was light. But we are seeing activity, so we think that bodes well although it's been hard to call the timing.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research.", "Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC", "Just quick clarifications and 2 actual questions. First off, on the $100 million of savings, is that a '15 run rate as you said, or is that '14?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "That's a 2015 run rate.", "Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay, perfect. And then the 2 questions. Just on distribution, I guess, are you seeing acceleration in that business? And is it accelerating at the same rate as kind of the overall orders or a little bit better? And then second on the networks business, typically when you see project activity build, how long does it take before you actually see that turn into actual revenues?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Yes, so on the distribution, we are seeing the book-to-bill is pretty consistent with our overall book-to-bill of 1.06 in the quarter, so we've seen that pickup pretty broad based across the world, which is encouraging, knock on wood. On the networks project business, it is hard to call. In SubCom, it's really hard to call because you can -- especially in the last 1.5 years, we've been selected for projects. We haven't -- it's not in our backlog, because until you actually sign up and signed the contract, but we've been selected, but in many cases, the projects haven't started yet. So they can take longer. I'd say, typically in the telecom business, the majority of these are accelerated builds. There are some -- there are -- the encouraging thing as well is there's some new fiber-to-the-home builds throughout the world. So I'd expect those to start showing up in revenue early next year.", "Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC", "Is it broadly geographic or is it Euro-centric or U.S.-centric?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "I'd say, in the U.S., it's kind of continuation of fiber is pretty well established, although it's not -- still not that deep in the network other than one of the carriers. So it's, I'd say, add-on business in the U.S. In Latin America, Middle East and Asia, it's new projects. And in Europe, it's continuation of all projects. But it's pretty sporadic in Europe. I would say Europe is still soft. There's a few carriers that are accelerating, but overall, it's soft.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.", "Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I was hoping maybe you could start just more broadly on inventory levels across the supply chain. I know you touched a little bit on automotive and distribution, but just maybe holistically, how do you feel about customer inventory levels?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Generally, pretty good. Again, I think after what happened 3 or 4 years ago to everybody in the supply chain, everybody has been more cautious and gotten better at this. I know we feel like we have. Our connections with the customer, our planning processes, our double checking, triple checking is much more rigorous than it was before. So in general, and I've spent a lot of time in the last quarter on the road with our customers and our distribution partners, and that's one of the first questions we talk about. I would say it doesn't feel like there's any kind of inventory issues.", "Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "That's helpful. As a follow-up question, can you help us understand or remind us, what it was that you guys did that enabled you to increase your design win activity in the mobile segment as some of the larger OEMs, and then what the new outlook is on timing for some of those new programs to ramp?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "I would say a couple of things. One, we're starting from a low base, to be frank, so winning a few more awards is better than we were. The big thing is we put new focus and new leadership in the business about 18 months ago that had a lot of experience in that space. And that's helped us on our speed-to-market. I felt -- I feel like we've always had good products, but we haven't always been great in the speed side of it, so that's improved. As I mentioned, we are being selective there, we're trying to really focus where we bring some technology to the customer and not focusing on the more commoditized side of the business.", "Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Maybe just to follow up a little bit on that. I mean, how much of the full year change to your revenue were some of these new programs outside of the FX part? And then do you guys have good visibility on when some of these new programs could ramp?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "It's a couple of programs. It's really no more than that and one that we didn't do and one that pushed out. So there's no -- there's not really a substantial change, it's not like a dramatic change in the number of programs in our pipeline. It's really a couple.", "Robert W. Hau", "Mark, we do get a typical seasonal lift into the second half of the year, particularly around the consumer devices element of the Consumer segment, which we have baked into our guidance.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Just a question on the full year guidance. Looking at your guidance for the June quarter and then full year on a revenue basis, it looks like September is going to be sort of flattish to up a little bit sequentially, which is seasonal. Yet to get to your full year EPS guidance, it looks like you're going to see fairly significant margin expansion with strong EPS growth on a sequential basis. So where is that coming from? Is that a mix issue, do you expect cost to come out through this cost-cutting program. Just trying to reconcile the difference there.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Sure. No, I think it's really 4 main areas. You could call it mix, I'd say it's strength of our Transportation business, particularly in this commercial vehicle, which is one of our strongest margin businesses, so that's one. It is continued productivity. And Bob mentioned the program that we call TEOA, which is our version of lean, is really, really starting to deliver results for us. You'll see it in the P&L and in productivity, but it's on-time delivery, it's quality. So that, our productivity levels are up nicely from where they were even 1 year ago. There are the benefits of the early stages of the restructuring just starting to kick in. And as Bob mentioned, we're doing it faster, we're trying to get it behind us and doing it faster. And then the benefits of the strong cash flow that we're primarily using for -- in return of capital to shareholders and shows up in the lower share count.", "Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And what's the assumption on share count for the June quarter with your guidance?", "Robert W. Hau", "We're planning roughly $150 million to $250 million per quarter on share repurchase. We did a little more than that in Q2. We closed out the quarter on an average fully diluted at, what, about 4.25 million shares, it will go down 2 million or 3 million per quarter for the balance of the year.", "Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And just lastly, we've seen gold come down and copper has been down in terms of pricing, when do you expect to see that favorably impact your margins?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "We'll see a little bit of a tailwind in the second half. But as you know, we hedge quite a bit, so we won't get the full benefit if it stays down until -- you really won't start to see that until next year. But year-over-year, we've got a little benefit. It's not a lot.", "Operator", "We have a question for the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.", "Kevin LaBuz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "This is Kevin LaBuz on behalf of Sherri. Taking a step back and looking at last year, you're expecting to see demand improve in the back half of the year and it turns out that didn't materialize. Just now fast forwarding to this year, wondering what gives you more confidence in seeing that growth come about or the improved demand in the back half of the year?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Sure. Well, we usually get a little bit of a lift sequentially. So we feel pretty confident about that. I'd say the main thing is the order rates in Q1 and Q2. So we're 4% year-over-year, and as I mentioned, that's continuing and even a little bit better than that in the first 3 weeks of April. So that gives us a lot of confidence around Q3 and early to Q4. I think the question, it's really a kind of a Q4 question in a way. If this order rate continues where we are, things will be good. And to your point, the economy, I think, in general, kind of plateau-ed and softened a little bit in the summer last year and that's affected our fourth quarter. So we feel more confident at this point because of the way the order rates are running year-over-year and what our channel partners are saying, what our customers are saying. But we've got to see it continue this way through this quarter. The order rates continue strong through this quarter and into the early -- the very beginning of the fourth quarter.", "Kevin LaBuz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "All right, that's helpful. And just looking at the distribution channel, have you seen any signs of restocking there?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "I don't know but -- maybe a little bit. I think it's really tracking demand, though. Frankly, because I think everybody is being careful about restocking in advance in light of the last 2 or 3 years where strong Q2, early Q3 momentum and then things petered out a bit. So I would say a little bit of restocking, but nothing else significant. It just feels like responding to customer and demand more than anything else.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Jim Suva with Citi.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Can you just take a step back and think about, as you run the business, kind of longer-term, help us understand kind of the organic true company in a normal environment sales growth opportunities for TE Connectivity? Maybe break it down into some of the major material components, such as content growth, what we -- you think over the long term will happen, unit growth maybe from automobiles. And then are ASP declines embedded in your content growth or then do we kind of deduct some type of ASP declines? And really how we should think about organically growing the company and maybe hopefully someday we get back to a more normalized environment.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Great question. Yes we think about this all the time. It's -- thinking ways in the last 5 years, it's hard to call any kind of trend, but if you look over the long historical trend around our connector business, which is about 75% of our business, you -- that's in the 5% to 6% range over a long trend, that hasn't been that high over the last 5 years. So of that -- so I would say 5% to 6% is probably the long-term trend when we look at the continued growth of electronics. And that really is about probably 8% volume, unit volume growth on average -- or maybe, yes, 6% unit volume growth rather, 2% price erosion, 2% to 3% content growth, in those ranges, plus or minus 1%. And it really is kind of market by market as well. That's the way we would build it up. So -- but historically, the industry has grown in that 5% to 6% range.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Amitabh Passi with UBS.", "James F. Hillier - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "This is Jim Hillier for Amitabh. In the Network Solutions business, if I look at this on a sequential basis, it looks like the operating margin showed a sequential drop with only a modest change in revenues quarter-over-quarter. Could you discuss the factors behind the margin softness and what's giving you the confidence that operating margins can improve to the high single-digit range exiting the year?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Yes, the slight margin erosion -- well, the margin is really low. I mean -- and it's primarily due to overall compared to where we've run in prior years, the volume being way down. SubCom is essentially breakeven right now, a little bit above that. So we believe that's at the low end of the cycle. So the improvement from the rate we're at, picking up 200 to 300 basis point over the next 2 quarters is first and foremost volume driven, most of which I would say is seasonal related, a little bit of project related. And secondly, the actions that Bob described, the actions we've been doing to -- in light of it being down longer than we thought, taking additional costs out to sure up sort of the baseline margin level. So it's a combination of those 2 things.", "James F. Hillier - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, got it. And then as a follow-up on Networking Solutions, if you could talk about your broader expectations for telecom and IT spending in the back half of the fiscal year, that would be helpful as well.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "For the back half -- well, for the back half of our year, which would -- is the -- ends in September 30, I think we feel more -- a little bit of a pickup on SubCom because of projects coming into force. So $80 million in the second quarter and getting back to the $100 million to $125 million kind of run rate at the end of the year. Telecom picking up, mostly seasonal, but a few projects ticking in. And then I'd say our enterprise and datacomm business flattish over the next 2 quarters. So it's really driven more by telecom and SubCom. So spending in those areas.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie Capital.", "Mike Wood - Macquarie Research", "You'd previously talked about the National Broadband Network contribution to the network segment growth this year. Has that also gotten pushed out or can you give us an update there?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "NBN ramped up in the quarter. In fact I was down there about 1.5 months ago and they're going aggressively. So I would say we're kind of at the run rate we expect to be over the next few quarters. So the big nice jump up in Q1 and Q2, and it's probably going to continue to run at that level for a couple of quarters as really just deploying the resources to accelerate that. So yes, we're well positioned there, we're shipping product, it's materializing. It's been -- it's taking a little longer than I think the original plan, but not unusual with a project of this magnitude. But it's real and we're shipping. It's one of the largest projects we have done.", "Mike Wood - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And of the roughly, I think you said $2.2 billion is China sales you had last year. Can you talk about how much of that is related to automotive and what you saw there in the quarter and what you're outlook is? I think China luxury vehicles are pretty strong in the first quarter.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Yes, we had a 20% growth in our China automotive business in the first quarter. We have a real strong position across every level of the market in China. And automotive is about 1/3 of our total revenue that we do in China, and we're pretty well spread out across our other businesses in China as well. It's the biggest local business per se, meaning that the products are all consumed in China, there's really no export in that. About 2/3 of our other business ends up in products that get exported.", "Well thanks, everyone, appreciate your time today. Just kind of just to reiterate, we really do feel good about this quarter. I think the operating leverage of the company continues to get better. The cash flow continues to be strong. The integration of Deutsche has gone very well. We're really pleased with the people mostly and the products. And I think we're adding a lot to the value proposition that Deutsch already had. We are looking for a nice pickup in the second half of the year, the current order rates are right in line with that. And I think importantly, at those revenue levels, expect to generate around 14%. And as I mentioned, we're definitely on track to do between dividend and share repurchase about $1 billion of capital return to shareholders. So thank you very much, and talk to in a quarter or if not before.", "Operator", "That does conclude our conference for today.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Keith Kolstrom, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Keith Kolstrom", "Thanks. Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's third quarter 2013 results. With me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch; and Chief Financial Officer, Bob Hau.", "During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information, and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning, and we ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items. The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com. [Operator Instructions]", "Now let me turn the call over to Tom for some opening comments.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Thanks, Keith, and good morning to everyone. If you would please turn to Slide 3. Q3 was a good quarter for the company. Sales and earnings exceeded the high end of our guidance range, and we had another terrific cash flow quarter. Orders were $3.4 billion for the quarter. Excluding our SubCom business, orders were up 2% versus last year, and book-to-bill was 1.02. Book-to-bill was over 1 for the third quarter in a row, and was at or above 1 in every one of our segments, excluding SubCom. This is the third quarter in a row of year-over-year quarters growth.", "Sales of $3.45 billion beat the high end of our guidance due to continued strength in the transportation market and improvements in the telecom market. In addition, due to project timing in the telecom market, we did benefit in Q3 from about $20 million of revenues that we originally expected to hit in Q4. We expect total company revenues in the second half to be up about $25 million versus the guidance midpoint we gave in April.", "Adjusted operating income margin was 14.8%, up 80 basis points versus the prior year and up 120 basis points sequentially. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.88 was $0.06 above the midpoint of our guidance due to the stronger sales and continued strong productivity performance. Free cash flow was $431 million, and we returned $314 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases.", "For the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the range of $3.30 -- $3.35 billion to $3.45 billion and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.88 to $0.92. This represents approximately 1% year-over-year sales growth and 18% year-over-year EPS growth. We now expect full year adjusted EPS of $3.20, at the midpoint of our guidance. This is up versus the prior guidance midpoint due -- guidance due to the strong Q3 performance.", "Now if you'd please turn to Slide 4. As I mentioned earlier, total company sales were $3.5 -- $3.45 billion, which was $25 million above the very -- the high end of our guidance range, driven by the auto and telecom businesses. Versus the prior year, sales were down about 1%.", "Please turn to Slide 5, and I'll review our segment performance in a little detail. Unless I indicate otherwise, all changes are on an organic basis, which excludes the effect of currencies, acquisitions and divestitures. We had another outstanding quarter in our Transportation business. Sales exceeded $1.4 billion, which were up 8%, and adjusted operating margins were just under 20%. Global automotive production was up 3% to 20.7 million units, with strength in the U.S. and China offsetting continued softness in Europe. We also continue to see improvements in the heavy truck markets in the U.S. and China.", "The strong operating margin performance is due to the increased revenue, continued productivity improvements and the strong performance in our commercial vehicle business. We are capitalizing on the Deutsch acquisition we made last year, and the integration is going very well. We expect another strong quarter end in Q4, with revenues up about 10% versus the prior year on an expected vehicle production increase of 3.5% and continued strength in the commercial vehicle market. Revenues will be down slightly, about 3%, due to seasonality.", "For the full year, global auto production is expected to be up 2%, in line with the historical average. Due to our strong performance and the addition of Deutsch, we expect to be able to grow Transportation revenue by 7% for the full year.", "Please turn to Slide 6. Sales and earnings in our Network Solutions segment were slightly better than expectation, due mostly to improved demand in the Telecom Networks business. The pickup in telecom is due primarily to increased carrier CapEx spending in the U.S., as well as selected projects in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The fiber and wireless portion of our telecom business continues to be strong, offsetting declines in copper network investment. We've seen this trend for a while now. We also saw an increase in carrier activity around expansion of the fiber portion of the broadband network across the global market over the past several quarters. This is a good sign. With the ADC integration behind us, we feel we are very well positioned to capitalize on this activity as it turns into projects.", "On a year-over-year basis, total segment revenues were down 4%. Subsea activity -- project activity continues to be fairly robust, but funding continues to be slow. In the DataComm equipment business, we continue to see a weak IT hardware spending environment, although some signs of that stabilizing. And additionally, we exited the low-end magnetics components business, which had revenue of about $60 million per year.", "Sequentially, sales increased 15%, and adjusted operating margins improved 300 basis points. The revenue increase is primarily due to seasonality and an uptick in demand in the telecom market. One encouraging point is for the first time in 6 quarters, revenue increased in our telecom business on a year-over-year basis. Orders in the segment, excluding SubCom, were up slightly versus last year, and the book-to-bill was 1.03. In Q4, we expect sales to decline slightly versus Q3, with adjusted operating margins continuing to improve to near the 10% level.", "Please turn to Slide 7. Sales and earnings in our Industrial Solutions segment were in line with expectations. On a year-over-year basis, sales were down 4%, as expected. Orders in this segment increased 4% over the prior year, and book-to-bill was 1.03. In the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be about flat with the prior year.", "We see continued strength in the commercial aerospace and oil and gas markets, some signs of improvement in the U.S. and Asian industrial equipment markets and continued softness in the energy market and in U.S. defense spending. But overall, our industrial markets feel like they're stabilizing and feel like they're in better shape than they were this time last year. We expect to exit Q4 with segment-adjusted operating margins back near the 15% range due to favorable product mix, our ongoing productivity improvements and Deutsch synergies.", "Please turn to Slide 8. Our focus on improving operating margins in our Consumer Solutions segment continue to make good progress in the quarter as adjusted operating margins improved to 10%. Overall demand in the segment was a little weaker than the prior year. In Q3, orders did strengthen in the appliance business in the U.S. and China. However, we experienced slower growth in the mobile device market and the continuation of a weak PC market.", "In Q4, we expect sales to increase approximately 3% sequentially and adjusted operating margins to remain above 10%. In the Consumer Devices portion of this segment, we continue to be selective in the programs we are pursuing in order to drive margin improvement.", "Now I'll turn it over to Bob, who's going to cover the financials in detail.", "Robert W. Hau", "Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Let me discuss earnings, which start on Slide 9. Our GAAP operating income for the quarter was $439 million, which includes restructuring charges of $67 million and Deutsch acquisition-related charges of $3 million. We continue to expect approximately $275 million of restructuring charges for the full year and a substantial reduction in the level of restructuring actions next year.", "Adjusted operating income was $509 million, with an adjusted operating margin of 14.8%, up 80 basis points from Q3 last year. Adjusted EPS were $0.88, and GAAP EPS were $0.79 for the quarter. GAAP EPS included $0.11 of restructuring and other charges and $0.02 of income related to tax items.", "If you'll turn to Slide 10, our adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 32.8%, which was the highest level since separation. This is a 180-basis-point increase versus the prior year and about $50 million less in sales. The increase is largely due to continued progress in our TEOA or Lean programs driving increased productivity, with reductions in both material and conversion costs and improved profitability related to the integration of Deutsch.", "Total OpEx spending was $623 million for the quarter, up $27 million versus the prior year, primarily due to several nonrecurring expenses during the quarter.", "In the right side of the slide, details of the items of the P&L below the operating line. Net interest expense was $32 million in the third quarter, and I expect approximately $32 million of expense in the fourth quarter. Adjusted other income, which relates to our tax sharing agreement, was $10 million and largely in line with guidance. The adjusted effective tax rate was 23.6%, in line with our guidance of 23% to 24%. And in the fourth quarter, I expect other income of about $8 million and a tax rate of about 23%.", "Before I move to the next slide, I want to mention the 8-K we filed on July 1, which provided an update on the Internal Revenue Service's review of the tax returns of Tyco International for the years 1997 to 2000. While this was an update on the status of the review, I want to assure everyone that our view has not changed on the eventual outcome regarding these issues or the amounts we expect to pay in the future.", "I'm turning to Slide 11, and I'll discuss our balance sheet and free cash flow. Cash from continuing operations was $614 million, and our free cash flow in Q3 was $431 million. Year-to-date, free cash flow of $1.1 billion is up 25% versus the prior year. Capital spending during the quarter was $144 million or about 4% of sales, consistent with our anticipated spending rate of approximately 4% to 5% of sales going forward. Our receivable days outstanding were 59 days, and inventory days on hand were 68 days. Both metrics remain in line with our expectations.", "Now let me discuss sources and uses of cash outside of free cash flow, shown on the right side of the slide. We began the quarter with $1.1 billion of cash and ended the quarter with about $1.3 billion. During the quarter, we returned a total of $314 million to shareholders. We paid dividends of $104 million and repurchased about 4.8 million shares for $210 million. As discussed on prior calls, the dividend increased in the quarter by approximately 19% to an annualized rate of $1 per share. We continue to expect additional share repurchases of $150 million to $250 million in the fourth quarter. The outstanding debt was $3 billion at the end of the quarter, and we expect similar levels for the remainder of fiscal 2013.", "Now I'll turn it back over to Tom.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Thanks, Bob. If you could please turn to Slide 12. Based on the order trends we've been discussing, we expect revenue in Q4 to be in the $3.35 billion to $3.45 billion range and adjusted EPS in the $0.88 to $0.92 range. This strong performance would result in adjusted EPS being up approximately 18% versus the prior year due to increased sales, improved productivity, cost reductions and our share repurchase program. Revenue is expected to be up 1% at the midpoint of our guidance due to continued strength in Transportation. And the important thing here is this is the first quarter of year-over-year sales growth since FY '11.", "Please turn to Slide 13. For the full year, we expect sales in the range of $13.2 billion to $13.3 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $3.18 to $3.22. The full year midpoint assumes revenues about flat versus the prior year, adjusted operating margins of about 14% and adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 12%. Second half adjusted earnings per share would be up about 15% versus the prior year on flat sales. Our adjusted EPS outlook is up compared to what we guided last quarter, due primarily to the strong Q3 performance. For the full year, we expect free cash flow of about $1.5 billion and a return in excess of $1.2 billion of capital to shareholders.", "A few final comments before we go to Q&A. I'm really pleased with the execution momentum we are building. Our team around the world is doing a very good job of navigating through the economic uncertainty, focusing on our customers' short-term and long-term needs and delivering strong earnings and cash performance. And I emphasize the long-term needs because we continue to invest alongside of our customers.", "Our adjusted operating margins are near 15%, and I'm confident we'll reach this level at about a $14 billion to $14.5 billion revenue run rate. This -- our annual free cash flow continues to run about 10% of revenue and gives us attractive choices. It enabled us to become a world leader in fiber optic connectivity, with the acquisition of ADC, and in harsh connectivity, with the acquisition of Deutsch. We've also increased our engineering and R&D investment to approximately $700 million per year in order to strengthen our technology and product pipeline across our businesses. And last but certainly not least, the substantial cash flow has enabled us to consistently raise our dividend and return close to $4 billion through share repurchase in our first 6 years. In total, we have returned over $5 billion in dividends and share repurchases to our shareholders since fiscal year 2008.", "TE Connectivity has a very strong business foundation, and we expect to deliver improved growth as the global economy recovers. Electronics continues to proliferate, and this requires more connectivity. And at TE, we're really proud to be the world leader enabling this connectivity.", "So now let's open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I have a question and a follow-up. First of all, maybe you guys could just touch on the Transportation margins, and it improved by 90 basis points, I think, sequentially to 19.8%. Maybe you could just talk about how much of this expansion was due to mix versus leverage. And then going forward, do you think these margins are sustainable in terms of there's no onetime benefit that you guys may have had in the June quarter?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Amit, to answer the last question, no, I don't -- there weren't any unusual onetime benefits in that business in the quarter. We're really getting the volume leverage and we're getting the operating leverage from cost actions we took several years ago. And we're getting much better in that business at core productivity, which, historically, was not a strong suit but is becoming a strong suit. As far as sustainability, I think an important thing to keep in mind, we're performing very well, but auto production is going to be up 2% to 3% this year, which is the historical average. So there's not a windfall on auto production. It feels a little better than that in the U.S. because the U.S. is up, but Europe and Japan, for example, this quarter -- this past quarter, have been down. So I think this is just many years' worth of improvements in a number of areas and, at the same time, continuing to invest in that business to make sure we stay ahead on the innovation and technology curve.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Got it. And I guess my follow-up, maybe -- I guess, maybe I want to clarify, Tom, we should still be thinking of 25% conversion margins in the Transportation segment, I want to make sure that, that's the right way to think about it. And then the networking side, the 300 basis points of margin expansion you guys had this quarter was much better than what I was thinking. Can you maybe talk about was it always just driven by revenue leverage? Because I think most of that restructuring benefit is supposed to be a fiscal '14 story, so I'm assuming there's more margin expansion left going forward even if revenues don't improve substantially.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Regarding the Transportation 25% fall-through, I think that's the right way to think about it over the cycle. In an up cycle, you might get a little more than that. In a down cycle, you're going to get more negative than that. But on average, we see it at about 25%. In networks, I would say there's 2 pieces: there's the continued improvement in productivity; and we're getting volume. As you know, that segment has -- that's been down for several years now, and we've been hurt by that. And -- but we took advantage of that to continue to tighten up the cost structure. It isn't really from the restructuring we introduced this year or we started this year. That's not going to kick in until next year.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jim Suva with Citi.", "Nicholas Jones", "This is Nicholas Jones on behalf of Jim Suva. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in European auto sales as far as like registrations versus production? Because I've noticed your outlook came down another percentage point for the full year outlook.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Well, with respect to auto in Europe, I would say our auto business has consistently strengthened relative to our outlook for the year. It's been partially execution on our part but a better market, generally, every quarter than we expected. In Europe, it's definitely soft. New car registrations were down 6% or 7%. Some think they're bottoming. I hear that. But we do benefit from the fact that we're very strong. We're strong across Europe but particularly strong with the German OEMs, and a significant portion of their business is export to the U.S. and China. So the strength in the U.S. and China is definitely helping those OEMs.", "Nicholas Jones", "Do you think Europe is kind of stable and going to look up next year? Or is it still going to remain soft maybe for another year or 2?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "I would tell you that's hard to call. I think for us, we just stay close to the customers and make sure our lead times are tight. The recent trends and, I think, the industry is calling stabilization somewhat flat to slightly up next year. I don't -- we'll be giving you our view of that in November, when we talk about our fiscal year '14.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "In the Transportation segment, did you see any pull-in in the China commercial segment ahead of the class 4 emission standards that were supposed to go into effect July 1 for heavy trucks? And how long do you think the strength in commercial persists? Do you see this as sort of multi-quarter from here?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "I think there might have been -- not in our revenue, there wasn't any pull-in because we're not that strong in the -- most of the heavy truck business because it tends to be a very local business. That's what's exciting about Euro 4 now becoming the law of the land because that's where our strength really comes to play and the combination of Deutsch and TE over there. So we're starting to see a lift in our orders but no big pickup in our revenue because of an acceleration to kind of get under the wire with the implementation of Euro 4. The heavy truck market, our orders are still pretty robust there and especially in the U.S. So the construction side has been a little bit flat, but I think we're optimistic, given the general direction of the U.S. economy.", "Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So continued strength for a few quarters here, at least?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "We certainly have that built into the fourth quarter.", "Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And Bob, as a quick follow-up, are you baking in any of the margin improvement from lower raw material costs here in your near-term forecast?", "Robert W. Hau", "Yes, so we have single-digit million benefit in fourth quarter from lower copper, gold and overall raw materials in our business. We are certainly seeing a benefit of the decline that we've seen over the last couple of months.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel.", "Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Question on the networking business and the margin targets. I know you've talked about getting -- eventually getting back to sort of a mid-teens operating margin. A couple of years ago, you were running at $1 billion of so of revenue a quarter. Do we need to get back to those volumes or will the cost-cutting actions that you're seeing enable you to get there sooner or mix or whatever the other issues?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "I would say, Matt, it's in the 3.5 to 4, depending on the mix of the businesses, but we have a better cost structure than we did. And we also have the benefits of the Deutsch synergy -- of the ADC synergies. Of course, right now, we're -- our SubCom business is at a very low point, and it's just a little bit above breakeven. Our telecom business margins are solid in the double digits, so as revenue picks up there, we expect to get a lot of leverage there. So we definitely feel this business, as it gets back to what we historically would define as a more normal revenue level, should be in -- at or around the company average margin. We [indiscernible].", "Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then on the Telecom Networks and in Enterprise, on the Enterprise side, are you seeing any signs of reinvestments there? For instance, December quarter into the next year. And then on the Telecom Networks side, are you seeing any signs of life in China in terms of any pipeline there?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "On Enterprise, it's mixed. The Enterprise business, in general, over the last several quarters, I'd say it's been going sideways, flips up, goes down. And it's a very, very local business. For example, we're strong in India, and our enterprise market there has been very slow because of the economy. We're doing -- we're number -- middle of the pack player in the U.S., so we're picking up there, particularly in the data center. But overall, I'd say it's pretty mixed and relatively flat. That's how we see it for the next quarter. In the -- your telecom question again? I'm sorry.", "Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Yes, just a bit about your outlook for China recovery and pickup there.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "I'd say 2 things: China's slow, and China's a tough market. It tends to be a very low-end market, so that's an area where we've become more selective over the last 2 or 3 quarters. We are really focusing on the mid- to high-end solution where they're available and because we find it super competitive at the low end. And in general, that's how we look at the company. We're staying away from the true commodity space that isn't strategic or necessary to kind of defend the balance of the business.", "Operator", "And we have a question from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.", "Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on the operating margin comments. I think the 15% threshold, the revenue required to get to that had been $15 billion to $15.5 billion of revenue overall. And Thomas, if I heard you properly, you said $14 billion -- around $14.5 billion now? With the restructuring that you're putting into place that comes into effect next year, should we expect the revenue that you need to get to 15% operating margin to come down further?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "I would say that, that includes the $14 billion to $14.5 billion, but we're close. Obviously, we're $14.8 billion in the third quarter, and it's down $1 billion from a year ago due to a couple of things: the margin leverage from Deutsch, the tremendous productivity year we're having, a little bit of business mix right now. For example, Consumer, with 15% of the business last year, it's 12% of the business this year. Some of that's Consumer being down and Automotive being up. So I think we have some of those kind of trends. But I feel confident in the $14 billion to $14.5 billion. Of course, we're not going to put a limit on that, but that's the best way to think of it. And think of it on an annual basis because we have seasonality, as you know. So Q3 is typically our peak quarter in revenue, all other things being equal. We come down a little bit in Q4. Last year we -- our revenue went down 3.5% to 4.5% sequentially to Q4. This year, only 1.5% because of some strength in other business. And then our weakest seasonal quarter is Q1. So when we say 15%, we're talking about a sustained full year of 15%, which means in the peak quarters, we'd be needing to run above 15%. We need to run 15.5%, for example, this time next year to offset what will be a lower-margin first quarter because of the lower sales due to the seasonality.", "Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "For my follow-up question, there's been some talk about improved spending on broadband in the U.S., and I'm hoping you can help us understand how well you're positioned to benefit from that.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Sure. We -- as you know, there's been a lot of announcements by the big carriers over the last 6 months and some search companies that are getting new into that business as well about expanding the amount of bandwidth per home. And more recently, just in the last week, another carrier announced a different type of plan where you could, as a consumer or a business, sign up for 500 megabits. One has announced they're going to deliver 1 gigabit. So that is all great news for us if it comes to pass. It tends to drive the whole industry to increased spending. So we did finally start to see a little bit of increased spending in the fiber portion of the network. And in our wireless business, which is still relatively small at about $150 million annual revenue, we've seen a double-digit pickup in the last 2 quarters as the carriers are trying to augment their tower-based network with not quite small cells, but distributed antenna systems. So it feels better than it has in a while for us in terms of spending on our portion of the network. I think there's only a couple of data points yet, so we're not getting carried away with bullishness. But what the customers are saying, we're seeing the amount of RFP activity in the U.S., all definitely feels more -- we're more bullish than we were last year, for sure.", "Operator", "We have a question from Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research.", "Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC", "I had, I guess, a follow-up, first, on the commodities. Assuming the second quarter is kind of where we see commodities bottom out, when would you see the full benefit, would it be the December quarter or kind of the March quarter of 2014 before you would see that fully run through the model?", "Robert W. Hau", "I think the key to think about is, we have a hedging program in place for our key raw commodities. And essentially, what we do is we look out our demand out 18 months, and we hedge roughly 50% of that demand. So there's definitely a lag in the impact, both negative and positive overall, from commodity swings. So if you think commodities bottomed out in second quarter, it's Q4, Q1 that you start seeing that benefit roll through the P&L.", "Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. And then as a follow-up, we've earlier said that -- Tom, you may have said the operating margin target for Industrial is about 15% in the fourth quarter. I was just wondering if you can confirm that. And then second kind of should that business, with maybe some incremental restructuring gains and some volumes coming through, be operating long-term above 15%?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "I'd answer yes on both counts, Shawn. Yes, we did say we expect to be back to the 15% range, and we definitely view that as the business. It should be above average company margins, no question, with a little pick up in revenue, continued improvement in productivity and the benefit of some of the restructuring we're doing.", "Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC", "Is that a business where you would see maybe most of the benefit from a commodity tailwind?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "No, I mean, actually, we use the most copper in absolute terms than proportionally in the Transportation business. But industrial does -- will benefit. But there's a lot of copper and precious metal in the Transportation business because of the harsh environment, super harsh environment.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike Wood with Macquarie.", "Mike Wood - Macquarie Research", "In terms of the Transportation segment outperformance versus the global vehicle production, can you talk about how much of that is being driven by content on passenger vehicles versus the C&I or the Deutsch contribution there? And maybe along those lines if you can talk about whether Deutsch is still on track with that roughly $0.05 a quarter accretion? Or if the better C&I is helping that?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Yes, I would say the performance, relative to production, is kind of all of those things you mention, other than Deutsch is really in the commercial vehicle, so it doesn't play into the light vehicle revenue versus production numbers. But we're benefiting as well from market share gains that we began to get into dine in [ph] shortly after the financial crisis. As you recall, we continue -- despite the significant drop in the auto business then, we made the decision to continue to invest in engineering and R&D and, in some cases, increased our investment. And that's really starting to play out. We won some design wins that usually takes 2 or 3 or 4 years to turn into revenue. And that's clearly helping us. So I think the industry estimates are we've gained 3 points of market share in the last 4 years. We do -- I think we're still gaining a little market share in China as well, even though we have a high market share there. Electronic content mix, I would say it's a little bit higher than norm because of the high-end car sales are a little bit higher than norm. It's not a big number, but we're getting a small tailwind from that. And our overall margin in Transportation is benefiting from just the addition of the Deutsch industrial and commercial business as it was because that was a high-20s EBITDA business and the synergy that we are slightly ahead of plan on the cost synergy. Revenue, although picking up, is slightly below plan. But the -- that overall acquisition is clearly shaping up to be a real winner for us.", "Robert W. Hau", "And Mike, we are on track to deliver the incremental $0.12 or $0.20 accretion from Deutsch.", "Keith Kolstrom", "And Mike, also -- it's Keith. As a data point, the commercial vehicle business was about $200 million in the quarter, so about 14% of the Transportation segment total.", "Mike Wood - Macquarie Research", "Got it. Okay. And also on the Subsea business, how far does your backlog take you out there? You're forecasting $110 million next quarter, but with the $20 million quarterly order rate, I mean, is that -- is there risk that, that pulls back down to your trough levels?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Yes, our backlog, as you know, we don't put anything in backlog until we get that first big downpayment and are ready to go into force as we say in that business. So I think -- Q4, we feel pretty good about it. That revenue level, some business needs to come into force to hit the -- to continue that revenue level or move it up. We're encouraged by the fact that there's a lot of programs out there, but that's been the case for a while. A year ago, I would've thought the SubCom business would be higher than it is now. And it's just taking longer to get the funding, but there's some very big projects that we've been awarded that are what I'd call very sensible projects. Sometimes, in this business, you can be awarded a project, but you know it's -- there's a 10% chance it's going to get built. We have several that are well over the 50% chance and the funding is close. So -- but in terms of visibility in backlog, it's a quarter or 2 at max right now. When you hit the boom time, it tends to move out to kind of a year to 5 quarters.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Amitabh Passi with UBS.", "Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Tom, a question on Network Solutions. We're hearing incrementally from operators focused on upgrading their copper networks to the VDSL2 plus or Vector VDSL. Can you remind us what that means for your business from a content perspective versus fiber to the prem type networks? It seems like there's a bit of a shift towards upgrading copper-based networks versus taking fiber all the way deep into the network.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "I think both are going on. But overall, investment in the copper network, almost everywhere, has been consistently declining. One of our strengths is that we have a strong copper business as well. So most -- more than half of our business is in the fiber network. Three years ago, that was different. So we feel we're really well positioned. Our overall growth rate has been down, even though our fiber growth rate has been consistently in the mid-single digits to double digits because of the slowdown in the copper network. So as long as there's investment in the network, we typically feel good about it. In the wired, the Last-Mile, the backhaul, whenever their carriers are making that a priority again, we're going to benefit from that because we have a very -- we really have the full end-to-end fiber and copper network, which nobody has anywhere near both of those to the extent that we do.", "Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And just as a follow-up, if I look at the operating margin expansion in that segment from roughly 6% to 9%, was that largely all driven by volume? Or would you say structurally, this segment is now at a higher operating margin level relative to where it was a quarter or 2 ago?", "Robert W. Hau", "Amitabh, there's certainly a benefit from the sequential growth. Sales up, I think, about 10% sequentially. Clearly, we've been doing some significant restructuring. We'll see benefits of that into '14 and '15. We are seeing the benefits of our TEOA and general productivity in that business. I'd say, we certainly feel better about margins at 9%. But historically, 13%, 14%, and we anticipate, in the long run, our Networks segment will be about company average. 6% last year, I think -- or excuse me, last quarter was abnormally low, and we're certainly happy to see the 300 bps improvement sequentially.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research.", "Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC", "Just a follow-up on that last comment. I was wondering, in terms of some of the restructuring activities in the Networks business, can you just sort of maybe give us an idea of what the actions were that has helped margins, how much was completed or maybe completed towards the end of the quarter that gives you sort of comfort into this quarter as you get the full benefits of that and sort of an idea what's left to do that's important? And I have a follow-up question.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "I'd say you have to think about the restructuring in that segment in 3 buckets. Over the last year or 2, most of it has been related to the ADC integration. So that's where most of it was. The -- what we call the legacy TE business was pretty lean in that business. And we knew one of the very attractive aspects of ADC, after their phenomenal product line and strong position in the fiber network was, there was a lot of opportunity to move their cost structure, more like the TE cost structure. So that is largely -- that's the major contributor. With the market being lighter in the last couple of years, we've taken that opportunity to take additional cost out. And then the third piece of the puzzle is the restructuring that's in the works now that will benefit starting next year. So some of that is additional -- what you'd call additional ADC plant, though but we don't -- we're -- we've been together a couple years now, so we don't distinguish that much anymore. And some of it is our Lean programs are really enabling us to put what used to be in 3 plants in 2 plants, along those lines. So there's really 3 pillars to the restructuring piece of it.", "Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC", "Great, that's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, I know you're not giving guidance for the December quarter, but relative to what you're seeing in both your sales and your orders for this quarter, how are you feeling about typical seasonality off of this base? Are there any markets that you feel a little bit better about, a little bit worse about, as you look out towards year-end spending?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "When I think about the markets in general, so let's think how we felt 6 months ago, we feel better. A part of that is because 6 months have gone by. But I do think on almost -- most indicators in our business, like we just -- we've talked about in this hour, orders up, book-to-bill up, things like that, are pretty -- are much better than they were a year ago. So if that lasts through the fourth quarter, I think that should -- we should feel better about the first quarter than we did a year ago. But as you know, it was in May of last year, we were feeling, as we guided 15 months ago, about the second half of FY '12 -- May of last year, the orders started to turn down. And it happened across the world, not just in our world. That didn't really turn back up until November. The good news is the order rates are still holding, and we're in the end of July. So I'd say that's a really positive sign, but I'd like to get through the next few months, obviously, before we start talking about next year.", "Operator", "And our last question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.", "Kevin LaBuz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "This is Kevin LaBuz on behalf of Sherry. My first is on your Consumers side. Could you just talk about what success you've had gaining traction in smartphones and tablets? And I have a follow-up.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Sure. I would say we've had more success in smartphones than tablets. We have a beachhead in tablets; it's fairly narrow. In the last 1.5 year, we've done extremely well with the smartphones designed in Asia. So it's not broad-based, but it's -- we have real momentum there. So in the tablets, not so well there but better in the other tablet area. So it's mixed for us, and it's still relatively small for us. And we continue to be very selective because not all smartphone and tablet business is great business. So that's really been our strategy. I think what I really feel good about and our team feels good about and deserves credit for is we know we can be successful where we target. It doesn't mean it'll happen overnight, but we know we can do the miniaturization, we know we can ramp from 0 to 500,000 parts a week in the way that's required in that market. We know we can be cost competitive and make an attractive margin in the projects we're targeting. So I'd say we feel like we have -- we know we have much better capability in that market, but we're still being selective.", "Kevin LaBuz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "All right. And then my next question is on the networking solutions side. Obviously, you sound a bit better this quarter than you did last. So I was just wondering what changes you've seen over the last 90 days that have led to the better assessment.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Well, I think, for sure, the second half in Networks is always better than the first half because of the seasonality and you're in the summer and you're coming out of the winter. So it always makes the business better. As Bob pointed out, margins were unusually low and at the bottom of our experience in the last quarter, so we knew they would get better. We're really seeing and encouraged by the activity in the large portion of the network. So much CapEx went into, particularly in the U.S., LTE in the last couple of years. But you still need the wired portion of the network if you're going to deliver video in -- 30 second download video into your tablet or smartphone. You need to be fiber or very close to the home. So sort of the physics would say got to build fiber deeper. The recent RFP activity says, boy, there's more RFP activity. We saw the first year-over-year increase in our orders in 6 quarters. So all of those are positive signs. A year ago, all of those weren't happening, and we were not as bullish, to say the least. so we -- but we also know that 1 quarter or 2 quarters doesn't make a trend. But the most important thing is we have an outstanding product line, and we are well positioned around the world. I mean, we are -- we're calling on every major carrier, and they know who we are, and they know what capabilities we have. And so we're positioned -- as they decide to accelerate, we're positioned to help them and benefit from that.", "I think that was the end of the questions. I'll just take a minute to wrap up. Again, a very good quarter for us. I would say this quarter is a result of many years of hard work. And certainly, improving economic conditions in a few areas have been helpful, but most of this performance is due to the strong execution by the teams around the company. And we've talked a lot about the leverage this company has, and you really see it the last couple quarters that, with a little bit of revenue tailwind, tremendous leverage in the margins, the core productivity is the best I've seen since I've been in the company. And Bob mentioned our Lean program, which we called TEOA. We're becoming a Lean company, and it's showing up in everything we do and probably, most importantly, our ability to service the customer. We've gone through accelerating our restructuring, so we'll start to see the benefits of that next year. And then the cash flow is strong in this company. What really is, I think, a very good sign is it's been pretty linear this year. And if you look at our working capital statistics, at the same time, our on-time delivery statistics are getting much better. When those 2 things are moving in the right direction, that tells me we're executing well. The most exciting thing is there's still a lot more room for improvement. So thank you for being on the call, and have a good summer. And we'll talk to you soon. And with that, operator, we'll close things off.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Please go ahead.", "Keith Kolstrom", "Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2013 results. With me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch; and Chief Financial Officer, Bob Hau..", "During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information, and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release.", "In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning, and we ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items.", "The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com. [Operator Instructions] .", "Now let me turn the call over to Tom for some opening comments.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Thanks, Keith and good morning, everyone. This was a very good quarter for the company and we capped the year of strong performance in an uncertain economy. Q4 is especially noteworthy for several reasons. Our organic growth was 3.3% and the company returned to growth for the first time since early last year as continued strength in our Transportation Solutions segment was augmented with growth in our Industrial Solutions segment and then our Telecom Networks and Appliances businesses.", "Quarters excluding our SubCom business, grew 6% in the quarter and the strength was broad-based in terms of end market and region. Our $0.93 per share is a new earnings record for TE and it's up 22% versus the same quarter last year.", "We delivered 15.7% adjusted operating margin at a run rate of less than $14 billion in annual revenue. We did have a very favorable mix in the quarter but adjusting to more normal mix our margins were still above 15%. Our efforts to driving lean across the company, which is our TE operating advantage program are really paying off with customer satisfaction and margin improvement and we'll have more to come on this at our Investor Day in November.", "For the third consecutive year, we were selected at the top 100 innovator by Thomson Reuters. 5 years ago, we stepped up and refocused our renovation efforts and we have a terrific product pipeline and a wide range of intellectual property that should fuel our growth for several years to come. And we had another strong cash flow quarter, and for the year delivered $1.5 billion in free cash flow, our sixth consecutive year of 10% or better cash flow yield on revenue.", "For the year just ended, we increased adjusted earnings per share by 13% on sales, which were relatively flat. The team did a great job of delivering cost savings and productivity to more than offset the impact of a slow economy.", "I'm also very pleased with the integration of the Deutsch acquisition. The markets for Industrial Transportation and Commercial Aircraft are strong and we expect to deliver the sales and cost synergy ahead of the acquisition plan.", "As expected, Deutsch has added great products and people at TE. I'm also very pleased that we generated adjusted net income in excess of 10% for the year, and as I mentioned earlier, we are converting these strong earnings into strong cash flow.", "During FY '13, we returned $1.2 billion in capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In fiscal year '14, we expect to return over $1 billion in capital shareholders -- in capital to shareholders, and as shown in our press release earlier this morning, our board has recently approved an increase of $1 billion to our share repurchase authorization.", "Now please turn to Slide 4. Total company sales were $3.43 billion and were up 3% organically versus the prior year. The sales increase was driven by continued strength in the Transportation segment and improving demand in the industrial and telecom businesses.", "Please turn to Slide 5, and I'll review our segment performance. Unless I indicate otherwise, all changes are on an organic basis, which excludes the effect of currencies, acquisitions and divestitures. We had another outstanding quarter in our Transportation business. Sales were $1.4 billion, up 10%, and adjusted operating margins were again over 19% and in line with our expectation. Global automotive production was up approximately 4% to 19.6 million units with strength in the U.S. and China. European demand continues to be soft but does appear to be stabilizing.", "We also continue to see improvements in the heavy truck markets in several geographies. The Deutsch acquisition positions us very strongly in this high end harsh connectivity market.", "The strong operating margin performance is due to the increased revenue, continued productivity improvements coupled with a very lean footprint and the strong performance in our commercial vehicle business. We expect another strong quarter in Q1, with revenues up about 10% versus the prior year on an expected vehicle production increase of about 3%.", "Please turn to Slide 6. Sales and earnings in our Industrial Solutions segment were better than expected due to stronger end market demand and favorable product and channel mix. Importantly, we had a strong ordered growth -- we had strong order growth for the second quarter in a row, a solid growth in every region. On a year-over-year basis, sales were up 2% and orders increased 10%. Book-to-bill was 0.96. Orders were especially strong in the commercial Aerospace and Industrial Equipment markets. Energy was up 7%.", "In the first quarter, we expect sales to be up mid-to-high single digits versus the prior year with Industrial Equipment up close to 10% and Aerospace and Defense and Energy up low to mid-single digits. Continued strength in our commercial Aerospace business is more than offsetting lower spending on Defense program.", "Sales and earnings in our Network Solutions business were little better than guidance. Within this segment, orders and sales continued to improve in our Telecom Networks business, which is the business where we provide the connectivity for the broadband network for telecom carriers and cable operators. Across the world, we are seeing a gradual pick up in fiber rich broadband network deployment. This improvement was offset by continued weakness in our DataComm equipment business.", "In our SubCom business, project activity continues to be robust and funding continues to be slow. Revenue in the quarter was in line with expectation but the return to the growth cycle looks to be in the second half.", "For the segment overall in Q1, we expect a slight decline in revenue as the weaknesses of SubCom and DataComm more than offset the growth in the telecom business.", "Please turn to Slide 8. Sales in the Consumer Solutions segment were down 5% versus the prior year. The continuation of declines in the PC market and a slowdown in the growth in smart phone and tablets more than offset our growth in our appliances business. In Q1, we expect sales to be down mid-single digits as growth in appliances is offset by continued softness in the Consumer Devices business.", "I'm going to turn it over to Bob who's going to cover the financials in more detail.", "Robert W. Hau", "Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Let me discuss earnings, which start on Slide 9. Our GAAP operating income for the quarter was $465 million, which includes restructuring charges of $71 million and acquisition related charges of $3 million.", "Restructuring charges were $311 million for the year, which was higher than our $275 million guidance. Given the progress we made on projects already announced, we implemented additional items that we originally expected to occur in fiscal 2014.", "In fiscal 2014, we anticipate a substantial reduction in the level of restructuring activity with charges of approximately $50 million. Adjusted operating income was $539 million with an adjusted operating margin of 15.7%, up 220 basis points from Q4 last year.", "The improvement is driven by 3% organic sales, productivity from TEOA and benefit of accelerated restructuring. As Tom mentioned, we did benefit from a favorable mix in the quarter.", "Adjusted EPS were $0.93 and GAAP EPS were $0.92 for the quarter. GAAP EPS included $0.13 of restructuring and other charges and $0.12 of income related to tax items.", "Turning to Slide 10. Our adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 33.7%, which was a record level for the company. This is a 190 basis point increase versus the prior year, largely due to continued progress in our TEOA or lean programs driving increased productivity with reductions in both material and conversion costs and improved profitability related to the integration of Deutsch.", "Total OpEx spending was $617 million in the quarter, which is flat versus the prior year despite sales being up 3% organically.", "On the right side of the page, net interest expense was $30 million for the fourth quarter and I expect approximately $31 million of expense in the first quarter with a decline of about $1 million per quarter as we move through the year in 2014.", "Adjusted other income, which relates to our tax sharing agreement was $7 million and largely in line with guidance. The adjusted effective tax rate was 23.8%, also in line with guidance.", "In the first quarter, I expect other income of about $8 million per quarter dropping to about $6 million per quarter for the remainder of the fiscal year. And expect the tax rate of 24% to 25% throughout fiscal year.", "Now turning to Slide 11, I'll discuss our balance sheet and free cash flow. Cash from continuing operations was $595 million and our free cash flow in Q4 was $412 million. Full year free cash flow was $1.5 billion.", "Capital spending during the quarter was $183 million or about 5% of sales. This is consistent with our anticipated spending rate of approximately 4% to 5% of sales going forward.", "Receivable days outstanding were 61 days and inventory days on hand were 68 days, both metrics remain in line with our expectations.", "Now let me discuss the sources and uses of cash outside of free cash flow shown on the right side of the slide.", "You see we began the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash and ended the quarter with about $1.4 billion. During the quarter, we returned a total of $313 million to shareholders. We paid dividends of $103 million and repurchased about 4.2 million shares for $210 million. We expect additional share repurchases of $150 million to $250 million per quarter during fiscal 2014 consistent with the 2013 levels.", "Outstanding debt was $3 billion at the end of the quarter.", "On October 18, we filed the press release calling for the redemption of all the outstanding 5.95% senior notes, which were to mature on January 15, 2014. The slightly earlier redemption is part of our normal cash management. And while no decisions have been finalized regarding replacement of this debt, I do not expect our capital structure to change from the redemption and continue to expect that levels to be about $3 billion.", "Now I'll turn it back to Tom.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Thanks, Bob. Please turn to Slide 12 and I'll cover our outlook.", "As I mentioned earlier, we've seen solid improvements in our order rates over the last couple of quarters in most of the end markets we serve. And although the overall global economy feels like it has more momentum than it did this time last year, though, there's clearly still uncertainty given slow job growth, the weak economy in Europe and an unsettled U.S. government budget.", "When we take all these trends into consideration, this is our guidance for Q1. In Q1, which is our seasonally slowest quarter of the year, we expect organic sales growth of 4% to 7% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 14% to 20%. At the midpoint of the guidance, adjusted EPS would be $0.76, an increase of 17%. I feel like this is a really good start to our new year.", "In Q1, we expect continued strong performance in our Transportation and Industrial businesses with high single-digit year-over-year growth. We expect our Network Solutions segment to be down slightly as improving conditions in the telecom network marks -- -networks market are offset by the softness in our DataComm business and continued project delays in SubCom.", "We expect our Consumer Solutions business to be down mid-to-high single digits as Q4 trends continue into Q1.", "Please turn to Slide 13. Now for our full year guidance. Based on these current trends, we expect our organic revenue growth in fiscal '14 to be in the range of 3% to 7%. We do expect the continuation of solid demand in the Transportation and Industrial markets as well is in the Appliances and Telecom Infrastructure markets. We expect continued softness in our SubCom business as contracts coming into the force remains low until at least the second half of the year and we expect our Consumer Devices business to be about flat.", "We expect to continue our execution momentum and to deliver adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.50 to $3.80, which is about a 13% year-over-year increase at the midpoint of our guidance range. This improvement is driven by organic sales growth, another year of strong productivity and the increased benefits of restructuring.", "At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect to deliver 15% adjusted operating margins for the full year at $13.9 billion of revenue. We also expect a significant reduction in restructuring charges as our footprint is much improved.", "Overall, this was an excellent quarter, a very solid year of earnings and sales growth -- and our cash growth and I feel good about our momentum entering fiscal '14. I'm confident that if the global economy continues to recover, we are well positioned to deliver attractive sales and earnings growth.", "Now let's open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Amit Daryanani, representing RBC Capital Markets.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Two questions for me. One, maybe you could just talk a little bit on the December quarter guide. I think sales, you're implying will be down about 4%, so call it $160 million, $165 million down sequentially. but if I'm run the math and EPS implies that operating income will be down $190 million or so. That suggests detrimental margins of 50% plus, so will you talk about why is such a severe decline or detrimental margin in the December quarter and then maybe you can give us comfort on why you see them expanding to getting out of 15% by year-end.", "Robert W. Hau", "Thanks, Amit. First, regarding the sales guide. As I mentioned, this is always our seasonally lowest quarter, so we will typically see a 4% to 5% sequential decline in revenue. It is a little higher fall off in operating income but that's not unusual either, because we typically -- what always happens in this quarter is you hit the holiday, you have less work days so your productivity and efficiency suffers a little disproportionately. And on top of that we come off what is typically a very strong quarter when we're running all out at the end of September. So if you look at how we pattern from last year, first half second half, almost exactly the same pattern. So no real difference there, that's why I'm confident that the sales growth and margin, particularly the margin growth through the second, third and fourth quarter and 15% is the -- I feel confident about achieving that.", "Fair enough. that's all. But let me just ask you a question about the Transportation side. If I look at the September results and also the December guide, looks like the Transportation business is up about 10% year-over-year organically in both quarters. If I looked at the lower production numbers, that's up about 3%. So I guess, it seems you are seeing about a 7% content growth for September and December, net of ASP erosion . Could you to tackle why you're seeing such a big acceleration on the content growth and could that perhaps sustain for the next several quarters as well?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Yes. I don't think it's -- there's any sudden change in content growth. But I think it's a couple of things. One, we continue to do well around the globe and are growing in every market. And believe we continue to move up our market shares. Secondly, the Industrial Transportation business is very strong with the heavy truck market. And that's a pretty high end market for us. So that's also lifting our growth rates.", "Operator", "Our next question today comes from line of Mike Wood with Macquarie.", "Mike Wood - Macquarie Research", "I wonder if you could comment in terms of the range of possible outcomes for SubC sales next year. In the context of $90 million next quarter, which would be at like a mid-$300 million run rate, and obviously you've talked about the robust pipeline. So what visibility do you have there in terms of the timing, potential downside, potential upside?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Thanks, Mike. Right now, I'd say SubCom feels flat year-over-year but the second half is hard to call. I think there's probably more upside than downside based on the project pipeline and when we map the extent of this project pipeline to prior years, we know all projects will not come into force but if we look at the typical come into force rate, we would expect to see things starting to pick up in the second half and as we watch projects move through their funding process. That's where we'd expect though -- first quarter is pretty much what the first quarter is going to be. Second quarter is probably going to be close to that. Hopeful that the second half picks up and these contracts that we won come into force.", "Mike Wood - Macquarie Research", "Great. And then if can you comment also on the Transportation segment follow-up to that last question. Next year in terms of your vehicle production guide, you have more of a contribution from Europe than you had in your projection for this quarter and 1Q? What's the impact on TEL in terms of that greater contribution from Europe from a content standpoint, your out performance versus the global vehicle production?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Well Europe definitely has higher content. And Europe, you really have to break it down. On the surface, which is the local demand for cars in Europe, that's been weak. But particularly, the German OEMs, they've been strong as they export quite a bit and that's where we are strongest. So we don't see a dramatic change there. We see a slight improvement in Europe for us. So there's no big swing in our numbers based on Europe.", "Operator", "Next we'll go to the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Looking at your margin guidance for FY '14, a 15%. Could you talk about the drivers? You have got 2 segments -- consumer and the Networking business you're guiding sort of flattish, you're coming off of peak margins in the Transportation business. What are the drivers in terms of margin expansion within the different segments particularly in the businesses that are guiding flat?", "Robert W. Hau", "Yes, Mike, this is Bob. Across the board in 2014, we're seeing improvement in operating margin from all 4 of our segments. As you know, we had significant restructuring activity is 2013 and we see the benefits coming through into 2014. We've indicated about a $100 million at exit. Into 2015, we'll see that $400 million. In our 2014 numbers, you have probably between $60 million and $70 million of operating income improvement from those restructuring activities. And of course, we continued down the path of lean and our TEOA activity. So all 4 of our segments, obviously, participating in that where we have the good top line growth obviously in our Transportation business and Industrial where we're seeing mid-to-high single digit growth, we'll get some nice volume leverage in our Industrial and Consumer business -- I mean, our Consumer and Networks businesses where they're a little bit more flattish, margin improvement will be harder to come by.", "Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And Tom, on the DataComm, the commentary continues to be cautious there. Do you see any signs of life going into fiscal '14 and if you think it's going to remain flat and down year-over-year. Are you looking at additional cost savings in that business?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "I would say it's going to be down, but most of the decline is because we exited some very low-end business this year. When you take that out, we're going to be slightly down. I think that's mostly just the slow market. But we're in the middle of the pack player there. That business has gone through a lot of restructuring over the last year, so I don't anticipate any significant additional restructuring there. Never say never, but we stepped up to that about 6 to 9 months ago.", "Operator", "Our next question today comes from the line of Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research.", "Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC", "Just following up on Matt's question on the margin targets. It's just, would you be willing, Bob, just kind of give a may be a range where you think each of the 4 segments could be for the year in terms of EBIT margin?", "Robert W. Hau", "I don't want to get into guidance by segment but I think the key -- and I've mentioned this in the previous answer, if you look at the volume growth overall top revenue Transportation, Industrial being kind of mid-to-high single digits Transportation, obviously stronger than Industrial but in general, nice improvement. That's where we're going to see the higher lift from a year-over-year standpoint. Consumer Solutions and network, we're seeing real benefits from the restructuring actions that we took in 2013 and continued improvement in new products have higher margins but without the volume lift you're not going to get dramatic improvement in the operating margin. Now obviously overall, I'm doing very well grown from the 14.2% we had this year to 15% next year. But clearly, Transportation and Industrial are doing majority of the heavy lifting given the volume.", "Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC", "Got you. I guess on the restructuring savings, maybe another way to come with that question is on that $70 million -- or $60 million to $70 million expect of restructuring savings to fall on the '14, how much of that is Networks versus Industrial versus consumer?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Probably the easiest way to think about that is if you look at where the investment went to $300 million, roughly between networks and consumer, 70% of the spending were in those 2 businesses. So you'll see that majority of the benefit in those 2 businesses. 40% networks and about 30% consumer.", "Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC", "Got you. Got you, that's helpful. Then just as a follow-up. I guess, with commodities being down, how much of a tailwind from commodities you're baking in on a dollar basis to your '14 numbers?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Commodity is definitely helping on a year-over-year basis, you have to be a little cautious, number one, there's a lot of the year left and our commodities still move. Additionally, with our hedging program that benefit feathers in over time. But on a full year basis, if commodities were to hold where they're at today, there's probably $45 million to $50 million of tailwind for us on a full year basis.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Jim Suva with Citi.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "When we think about the outlook, just to be clear I assume that the stock buyback, I think you said $150 million to $250 million per quarter is built into your EPS guidance. And then also, am I correct that you are not building any potential acquisition so if you can talk about that a little bit because it seems like you past acquisitions are progressing better than historical and some of your peers do a lot of acquisitions. Are you now looking at the point where we should expect TEL to start a little bit more aggressive on acquisitions?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Yes, Jim. We have baked in the share repurchase at that $150 million to $250 million range, the range of repurchasing we had in '13 and we plan to continue that per quarter going into 2014, so that's baked in, a modest improvement in the shares outstanding minus reduction. In terms of acquisitions, we have not baked into our guidance any acquisitions we may or may not do into 2014. Obviously, if we were to conclude any acquisitions in the year, we've revised our guidance to that point.", "Robert W. Hau", "Just adding onto that regarding M&A. We have a robust pipeline. But as you know, we're pretty thoughtful about it. We really focus on strategic fit. But I would expect and we desire to continue to round out our product line and our overall connectivity portfolio. It's a big market. We have the broadest product line but we're not satisfied yet. So we're always looking, but we don't build that into our outlook.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Great. And as a quick follow-up, there's been some indications that the Australia fiber build out has been slowing down here, as well as some changes in China. Is that incorporated into your guidance, did you put in some conservatism there for it, and how should we think about those recent trends that are happening into those area, which once were a very highly attractive area and very robust outlook?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "I would say Australia for sure is still -- are very attractive. what's going on there, as you know, the changing government, they've got to sort through how they want to build the broadband network. The prior government was fiber to the home. This is more like fiber to the node. In both cases it's a lot more fiber in and a lot more broadband in the country had today. So it could affect us, $10 million, $15 million a year is our estimate right now, which we have included in our guidance. So we don't see -- I mean things could change, but we're not getting any indication and we're very close to the organization down there. On China, we are being [audio gap] in China, it's where we play in the network, it's a business you need to be selective in. I would say generally, this is reflected in our guidance, the market hasn't been as attractive as we saw a couple of years ago, a lot of competition, a lot of low-end competition, so much like we do on our energy business in the market like China. We're selective in playing were quality and reliability really matters. But from our telecom perspective, that business has been a slow business for us. The opposite side of the road on automotive so to speak, which has been, it continues to be a booming business for us.", "Operator", "A question today comes from the line of Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs.", "Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I was hoping you could help us, remind us about what your exposure is to the European market and I think there is some green shoots in the Automotive business and than maybe even in Telecom as we look into the 2014. So are you seeing any positive indications in Europe and can you help us think about how much TE might benefit from that?", "Robert W. Hau", "About a third of our business is done in Europe. The biggest part of that is Automotive. And a pretty significant portion of that business, 20% to 30% is exported out. So it's a little murky to walk through. But in general, we're strong in all our businesses in Europe and that has depressed our growth rates over the past 2 years but we have a strong, profitable businesses there, our best businesses, Automotive which as I indicated is continue to be a good business because of the export base. Our strongest Energy market is in Europe, which has been a slow this year, very slow, but we're starting to see signs of picking up. We have a pretty sizable telecom business in Europe, which is not very fiber rich yet. So we're encouraged about the prospects for that and we are seeing some green shoots so to speak in some areas of accelerated fiber build out. And our largest industrial equipment business is in Europe, which has been slow but is also, as we mentioned in overall Industrial business, showing signs of stabilizing and picking up. So I'd categorize Europe end market demand as being feeling a little bit better, but off of a low base. So it's nothing to get gleeful over yet but the stabilizing is the way it looks.", "Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "That's helpful. For my follow-up, can you guys just clarify on the restructuring benefits that you assume for fiscal '14, I know a $60 million to $70 million -- is that the $60 million to $70 million of benefit that you got for fiscal '14 overall or as you exit fiscal '14 you will be getting to $60 million to $70 million on a run rate basis?", "Robert W. Hau", "The $60 million to $70 million is for the full year. We'll exit a bit higher and what we've said is $100 million plus benefit into 2015 once we hit that full run rate.", "Operator", "And we have a question from the line of William Stein with SunTrust Robinson.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "I'm wondering if you can comment on the cash flow outlook for next year with the lower restructuring charge. How does that affect cash?", "Robert W. Hau", "Thanks, Will. I think we're going to continue to generate cash at around the net income level. So I'd say it's in that 14, plus or minus. I do expect some CapEx to increase year-over-year and restructuring charges are down but restructuring spending is about flat. So and the early stages of restructuring our cash outflow lags our charges and that eventually, it catches up. Bob, I don't know if you want to add on to that.", "Robert W. Hau", "Yes, the charges that you see or saw in 2013, that's $300 million plus, the cash flow is out really over 3 years, simply the majority of it is in 2013 and 2014. '14 it's up slightly, but not significant one.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "That's helpful. And then if I can just hit the margins, I know there has been a lot of discussion on this. It's like Transportation at a very strong level going higher and certainly for the company, you just go blew through the 15% target nicely in the quarter. How we think about aggregate to the operating line, and then is there a significant delta from 1 segment to the next with regards to the drop through?", "Robert W. Hau", "I'd say relative to the relationships of the businesses, Transportation and Industrial, which are a long cycle highly engineered, harsh environment businesses, which honestly is that we do best at, have a higher flow through than the Consumer, which is the other end of the spectrum where you need volume particularly in devices to get flow-through and volumes has been intermittent for us there. Networks is sort of the mix. Our Telecom Networks business, again, highly engineered products and harsh environment, high flow-through. So you'll typically get higher flow-through in Industrial and then Transportation and Telecom networks.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. [Operator Instructions]", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Just have a quick follow-up guys. Regarding the capital allocation, Tom, I think you mentioned at the onset of the call that you expect to return $1 billion back to shareholders. But if I do my math, at least at the midpoint of the buyback on that $150 million to $250 million range that would be $800 million alone and in your dividend policy, I think it's a little over $400 million. That would put you all up to $1.2 billion, I think. So does that imply that maybe the buybacks would be at the lower in the $150 million to $250 million range or do I just mishear the $1 billion comment initially?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "I said $1 billion, but it's early in the year. Last year was the year of no M&A, to be determined what happens this year. Well I think, think of that as what we see right now, that's what is the most likely range. What happened this year as we progress through the year, there were no M&A opportunities that made sense to us, so we increased the buyback. That could happen again or if we see the right opportunities that are strategic and help us strengthen the company and increase our growth rate, we'll go in that direction. But at this point, I'd say a $1 billion is the way to think about it in total.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "So that, I guess, Tom, that would imply the buyback would be $150 million a quarter then, right?", "Robert W. Hau", "Amit, actually the comment on the script was over $1 billion, so I mean, again, it's early in the year so.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "If you were to take it literally in a $1 billion, it would be at the low-end.", "Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Got it. So the way to think about it is at minimum it is going to be $150 million, and as you ramp through the year, and if you don't find or don't do enough deals, you can ratchet it up higher much as you did in fiscal '13?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "That's correct.", "Operator", "And speakers, nobody else is queued up at this time.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Thanks, everyone for calling in. Just one reminder. Our Investor Day, the first one in 2 years is in New York on November 19 and we look forward to hopefully seeing all of you there.

(NYSE:TEL) Q1 2014 Earnings Conference Call January 22, 2014  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Keith Kolstrom - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thomas Lynch - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer", "Robert Hau - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President", "Analysts", "Mike Wood - Macquarie", "Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Matt Sheerin - Stifel", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Jim Suva - Citi", "Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Steven Fox - Cross Research", "Amitabh Passi - UBS", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the TE Connectivity First Quarter Earnings Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Keith Kolstrom, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Keith Kolstrom", "Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's first quarter fiscal 2014 results. With me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch; and Chief Financial Officer, Bob Hau.", "During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information, and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release.", "In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning, and we ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items.", "The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com.", "Finally, I would ask for -- participants on the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call that everyone try to limit themselves to one follow-up question to allow enough time for everyone to get their questions in during the allotted time.", "Now, let me turn the call over to Tom for some opening comments.", "Thomas Lynch", "Thanks Keith and good morning everyone.", "If you turn to Slide, I think its Slide 3 that's the summary of our results. The company is off to a very good start in Q1. The majority of the markets we serve continue to improve and we are executing well. Following are some of the key highlights of the quarter.", "Orders increased 8% in the quarter and our book-to-bill is 1.03 excluding our SubCom business. This is the third consecutive quarter of organic orders growth. And the strength was broad based across all regions and in the majority of our businesses. Organically sales were up 7% overall and up 8% excluding SubCom.", "The transportation market continues to be very strong and we are the clear leader in this market and capitalizing on the strength. Our industrial markets and our telecom markets continue to improve in the quarter. This more than offset continued weakness in SubCom and DataCom.", "Adjusted operating margins were 14.6% up 220 basis points over the prior year, stronger revenue, productivity gains driven by our TEOA program, increased savings from restructuring and metal tailwinds drove this improvement. We are on track to exceed 15% adjusted operating margins for the full year at $14 billion sales level.", "Adjusted earnings per share of $0.82 was up 26% versus last year and $0.06 better than the mid-point of our guidance. Free cash flow is $266 million and put us on track for another year of 10% plus cash flow as a percent of revenue.", "As a result of the strong Q1 and strong orders performance, we are raising the mid-point of our full year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 to $3.75. This is an increase of 16% versus our prior year performance. And additionally, our Board has recommended that at our annual meeting in March, our shareholders approve a 16% increase in the dividend.", "Please turn to Slide 4. This Slide summarizes revenue by segment. I will now go into each segment in more detail unless I indicate otherwise all changes are on an organic basis which reflects the effect of currencies, acquisitions and divestitures.", "Please turn to Slide 5. We had another strong quarter in transportation sales of $1.44 billion were up 14% over the prior year and orders were up 13% with the book-to-bill of 1.02.", "Global auto demand continues to be strong running a little head of historical long-term vehicle growth levels. Vehicle production in the quarter was about 20.8 million units up 4% from last year. Revenue from the heavy truck market was also very strong in the quarter due to the improving economy and the acceleration of purchases and advance of new emission standard in Europe and China. And as I said last quarter, the Deutsch acquisition is really helping in this market.", "Revenue grew in all regions this quarter. Europe was up about 11% due to strong exports and slight improvements in local demand. We are encouraged by increased new car registrations across most of Europe in December, the first time it's been this broad based in a while. We do believe pent-up demand and gradual improvement in the economy are driving this and expect to have another solid revenue year with our European customers.", "In the Americas, revenues were up 15% due to continued strong demand and share gains from our investments made during the downturn. We expect solid production growth to continue through FY 2014.", "Asia revenues were up 17% with 30% growth in China and 27% in Japan. We expect to continue our momentum across Asia through the year.", "Our margin improvement was due to a combination of favorable mix with more heavy trucks than the industrial transportation market. Stronger overall volume, productivity improvements driven by our TEOA program and favorable metal cost. We expect another quarter of double-digit growth in Q2 and mid to high-single digit sales growth in the second half.", "Please turn to Page 6, market demand in the industrial solutions segment continue to strengthen through the quarter and our revenues were up 6% and orders were up 9%. This performance was inline with our expectations. Similar to last quarter, the industrial equipment, commercial aerospace and oil and gas market continued to have strong demand and we expect this to continue for the balance of the year.", "Our energy business grew 4% in the quarter, but we do see signs of softening in the next couple of quarters especially in Europe. We also believe the defense portion of our business should pick-up a bit based on the resolution of the U.S. government budget.", "Looking forward, we expect another good quarter in Q2, the sales up about 6% due to the trend we discussed.", "Please turn to Page 7, performance in our network solution segment was mixed in the quarter and overall in line with expectations. Sales of $713 million were flat versus the prior year. On the positive side, the telecom networks business grew 11% in the quarter driven by increased investments in fiber optics networks. The enterprise business was up 6% with growth in all regions, offsetting that our DataCom business was down 8%. We are making progress in high-speed system wins, but we do continue to lag the market in mid and lower speed, which is where most of the volume is today.", "The SubCom market continues to be slow in projects going into force but our backlog of awards continues to be strong. We still expect the business to pick up in the second half due to two new projects which we expect to come into force this quarter.", "Margin in this segment were adversely impacted by two assets write-offs, excluding these write-offs adjusted operating margins were about last year. We expect Q2 results to be up slightly versus Q1 and I would expect our normal seasonal second half pick up in the segment in addition to an increase in SubCom revenues as these new contracts come into force.", "Adjusted operating margins in the second half are expected to be back to double-digit based on \u2013 low double digits based on the expected volume increase.", "Please turn to Slide 8, revenue in our consumer solutions business was up slightly in the quarter, the overall trends in this quarter was similar to Q4 of last year, improving demand in the appliance market, declining PC demand and strength in tablets and smartphones. We are capitalizing on the stronger appliance market where we have the leading market share. We have adjusted into the PC decline in our consumer devices business and are making gradual progress in smartphones and tablets.", "Adjusted operating margin in this segment was similar to the prior year. In Q2, we expect revenue to be down 3% to 4% versus the prior year. However, adjusted margins are expected to be similar to the prior year levels.", "Now, let me turn it over to Bob Hau to cover the financials in more detail.", "Robert Hau", "Thanks Tom and good morning everyone.", "A quick footnote of Tom's market comments, effective for the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we realigned certain businesses principally the relay products business within our segment reporting structure to better align our product portfolio. Approximately $100 million of annual revenue, which was previously reported as part of the appliance business inside the consumer segment has been moved to the industrial equipment business in the industrial segment.", "We have included a Slide in the appendix of today's presentation, which provides the impact of each of the quarters of fiscal 2013 and 2012 for reference.", "Now, let me discuss earnings which start on Slide 9. Adjusted operating income was $486 million up 25% from the prior year. GAAP operating income was $479 million and includes $7 million of restructuring charges in the quarter. As I mentioned on the earnings call in October, we anticipate a substantial reduction in the level of restructuring activities in fiscal 2014, which charges for the full year of approximately $50 million versus $311 million of charges in fiscal 2013.", "Adjusted operating margin was 14.6% up 220 basis points from Q1 last year. The improvement is a continuation of a strong momentum that was achieved through the course of fiscal 2013 and a change versus the prior year is driven by 7% organic sales growth, productivity from TEOA, cost savings from restructuring actions taken in the last couple of years and favorable metal costs.", "Adjusted earnings per share were $0.82 and GAAP earnings per share were $0.85 for the quarter. GAAP EPS included $0.01 of restructuring and other charges and $0.04 of income related to legacy shared tax liabilities.", "Turning to Slide 10, our gross margin in the quarter was 33.6%. This is a 200 basis point increase versus the prior year due to volume increases \u2013 increased productivity from TEOA or lien programs and cost savings from restructuring. Total OpEx spending was $631 million in the quarter, which is up 5% versus the prior year. The increase resulted primarily from increased selling expenses to support higher sales levels and increased variable compensation cost partially offset by cost savings attributable through restructuring actions.", "On the right-side of the Slide, net interest expense was $29 million in the first quarter and I expect approximately $27 million of expense in the second quarter and similar levels through the remainder of the year. Adjusted other income which primarily relates to our tax sharing agreement was $7 million and in line with guidance. In the second quarter, I expect other income of about $6 million.", "The adjusted effective tax rate was 26.1%, which was higher than our guidance of 24% to 25% due primarily to a one-time expense of approximately $10 million related to a change in tax laws in Europe. I expect the tax rate to return to the 24% to 25% range through the remainder of the fiscal year.", "Turning to Slide 11, I will discuss our balance sheet and free cash flow. Cash from continuing operations was $387 million and our free cash flow in Q1 was $266 million. Net capital spending during the quarter was $121 million, or about 4% of sales. I continue to expect capital spending rate to be approximately 4% to 5% of sales for the full year.", "Receivable days outstanding were 62 days, which is down slightly versus the prior year. And inventory days on hand were 74 days consistent with prior year levels. Both metrics remain in line with our expectations.", "Let me discuss sources and uses of cash outside of free cash flow shown on the right side of the slide. We began and ended the quarter with $1.4 billion of cash. During the quarter, we returned a total of $315 million to shareholders. We paid dividends of $103 million, repurchased about 4 million shares for $212 million. We expect additional share repurchases of $150 million to $250 million per quarter during fiscal 2014. Our outstanding debt was $3 billion at the end of the quarter.", "Now, I will turn it back over to Tom.", "Thomas Lynch", "Thanks Bob.", "Please turn to Slide 12, and I will cover our outlook. As I said earlier, this was a very good start to the year for TE driven by a strong transportation market, continued improvement in most industrial markets and strong execution across the company. And order trends were strong in most of our businesses.", "Based on these trends, we expect Q2 revenue of $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion, which is an organic growth rate of 5% to 8%. We expect adjusted earnings per share of $0.88 to $0.92, an increase of 16% to 21%.", "In Q2, we expect another strong quarter in transportation and a good quarter in the industrial segment, network and consumer results will be largely similar to Q1. For the full year, we expect revenue of $13.8 billion to $14.2 billion, which is organic growth of 4% to 7%. We expected adjusted earnings per share of $3.55 to $3.85 and this is an increase of 13% to 19% and as Bob mentioned a $0.19 in our guidance from last quarter for the year.", "Just to close, the momentum we saw in most of our markets in the second half of our last year has continued through the first four months of this year, these improving market conditions coupled with our operating leverage improvements driven by TEOA and the accelerated restructuring last year should enable us to deliver strong performance in fiscal 2014.", "Now, let's open it up for questions, operator please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Mike Wood, Macquarie. Please go ahead.", "Mike Wood - Macquarie", "Hi. Thank you. Congratulations on the quarter.", "Thomas Lynch", "Thank you.", "Mike Wood - Macquarie", "In terms of just some more color on the European growth on the transportation side, it looks like you are forecasting 3% vehicle production growth for the full year next quarter. Recently you have been exceeding that by a substantial margin in terms of your sales. You have mentioned exports, how much of that is actually related to any kind of a pre-buy in the C&I side of the business in Deutsch related to the emission standards changing?", "Thomas Lynch", "There is clearly some of that, just to keep in mind of our total transportation, industrial transportation is in the neighborhood of 15%. So while it's definitely a good thing, it's not that much overall leverage on the segment.", "The European light vehicle market has especially with the German OEMs significant amount of exports and a lot of that is premium cars to the U.S. and China where we have very nice content. So that help to offset what has been for several years now weak global demand in Europe that is, as I mentioned, we are encouraged to see over the last couple of months and especially in December, our pick-up in year-over-year new car registration. It's not a long trend yet, but it feels like in talking to our customers its moving in the right direction.", "So we expect another solid year with our European customers.", "Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie", "Okay. And in DataCom, you'd spoken previously about skipping a product generation there moving too quickly to more advanced speed connector. But you are redesigning that 10 gigabyte speed connector. How is that acceptance going, are you just too late to kind of make traction in that particular product?", "Thomas Lynch", "I'd say we're doing well in high speed in terms of customer selecting us for next generation. It is going slower than we would have thought a year ago and that whole market if you watch the big equipment OEMs, there is a lot of dynamics in that market right now and the net effect for us is the switch to new higher speed solution it's taking longer. So, it's going to be, I think a couple of years before we meaningfully move the \u2013 a meter in our DataCom business. Given that I mean its good product line, important product line to us and it's also their products that ultimately move into other parts of our business down the road, but it's been slower than we would have thought for the reasons I said.", "Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie", "", "Okay. Thank you.", "Thomas Lynch", "You're welcome. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "", "Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Which geographic regions did you see the strength in industrial transport. And Tom even for that 15% of revs you're talking about, what sort of growth did you actually see in that part of industrial transportation? And have a quick follow up on margins.", "Thomas Lynch", "", "The overall growth was well north \u2013 was north of 10%, very, very robust double-digit. Again, some of that is go forward, we did see very nice growth in China and Europe, solid growth in the U.S. What I would expect will happen is that will moderate especially in China and Europe where the new standards are being implemented, that will moderate in the second half, but I would expect the U.S. will continue to improve as the economy improves.", "Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "", "Thanks Tom. On margins then should we expect the margins to sort of play out at this level, so maybe the mix becomes less of a benefit, but you continue to see volume growth as Europe improves through the course of year?", "Thomas Lynch", "Yes, Wamsi. That's a good way to think about it. We won't have as much favorable mix from the industrial transportation group. We will continue to see nice volumes and get the benefits of that. And the metal levels made them pretty steady now for couple of quarters. So, while there is year-over-year tailwinds on a sequentially through the year, I wouldn't expect that. So I would think of the transportation business continued nice sales growth really solid sales growth in this margin neighborhood.", "Robert Hau", "Wamsi, I would expect that mix to moderate which means the year-over-year margin expansion will slow. In this quarter we're looking at 440 basis points, we will continue to see that but I would continue to see very good margins across the segment going forward.", "Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Thomas Lynch", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Next, we'll go to line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is open.", "Matt Sheerin \u2013 Stifel", "", "Yes. Thank you. Obviously you have had nice margin expansion in transportation; industrial as well. But looking at the other businesses, particularly the computing, the consumer business, what drives those margins? Is it volumes at this point? And looking within that business, I know you have some PC exposure. You talked about weakness there; it looks like demand is beginning to stabilize. And then also in terms of your position on the mobility side, what is your outlook in terms of market share opportunities there?", "Thomas Lynch", "So Matt regarding the margin question, I think your characterization is accurate that we are -- in the transportation and industrial business we're getting less due to volume and productivity. In the networks and consumer business I feel good what the team is doing productivity-wise, but we're not getting the volume yet, different reasons overall in networks we got a very slow SubCom business and the DataCom that I already talked to.", "In consumer, while PC is hopefully the rate of decline will start to level off which will help us. But we're making that's a slow steady progress in the tablets and smartphone, it doesn't really have \u2013 even though the product cycles are shorter than in the industrial business for sure, it's still you got to win one designing at a time. So until we begin to see our overall volume in consumer devices get consistently over 5% or 6%, that's what it's going to take to begin to move the margin up.", "In the consumer Solutions segment the appliances business is a very nice margin business at about company average and starting to grow again with the improving economy.", "Matt Sheerin \u2013 Stifel", "Okay great. And then a question for Bob on the margins. In some of the commentary you talked about some materials benefits particularly metals. But could you talk about other things like copper and gold for instance and any tailwinds there in terms of margins and benefits on costs?", "Robert Hau", "Yes. So overall in the first quarter, we did definitely see a tailwind of metals which for us is really copper, silver and gold. And those probably about $15 million, $16 million benefit in the quarter. For the full year, we're actually expecting about $50 million or $60 million so that quarterly $15 million, $16 million or so will remain in effects for the balance of the year.", "Matt Sheerin \u2013 Stifel", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go to line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks a lot, good morning guys. I've two questions as well. Maybe just start off on the transportation side. For the last couple of quarters, and especially the December quarter, your business was up 14%, production was up 4%. If I look at that 10% of out performance, if you may, it seems to be a lot more than just content growth of the Euro -- E6 mandate helping you out. I'm curious; maybe you could talk about that 10%. How much do you think is content versus potential share gains versus new platform wins? I'm trying to get a sense of can you sustain this kind of out performance going forward?", "Thomas Lynch", "Well, I think very strong performance for a couple of reasons, some of it is mix again with the industrial transportation business where we have a very strong position as a result of combining Deutsch with our legacy TE industrial transportation business. And that business is growing much faster right now than the auto business which is still growing light vehicle is still up plus 10% for us.", "In certain markets in China, in the U.S. we think we continue to gain share, we really invested -- have invested in those markets particularly during the downturn and now that's starting to show up in our revenue. So but and I do think you'd expect to see us drop down to high single digit growth in the second half of the year in the overall transportation segment. It feels like we gained a little bit of share year-over-year.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "That is all. Then just on the network solutions side, demand has been challenging for you guys for several quarters now. And if you think of the headwinds in DataCom and Subsea really, do you think you have to look at options to potentially further right-size this business, or do you feel comfortable looking at the book-to-bill that demand will come back in the back half and you just got to wait for that revenues to flow in? I'm just curious how you think about rightsizing the business versus waiting for demand in the back half right now.", "Thomas Lynch", "Well, I think there are two different answers to that. SubCom, I think we're positioned, it's been slower than we thought. I'd be more worried if there wasn't as much project activity as there is, that those projects have to turn into come into force. So we feel reasonably confident although this market has slid on us for the last two or three quarters but we're very strong in the market. I don't think we've ever been stronger in terms of our product offering. So that market comes back with our strength in it we're confident we'll do very well and we think we'll start to see that in the second half.", "DataCom is a little bit different. We're not strong in that market. We have done a lot to adjust our cost structure to reflect that without -- we haven't reduced our engineering investment. And so that we do have a significant engineering investment for IT type solutions there both in fiber and copper. As I mentioned, they are going slower, I don't, we have no intention to take more cost out of the business. It's an important business for us. We believe it's really upside for us, but I think if you go back to where I thought would be a year from now, I thought that would be more deployment of high speed than there is, so it is definitely pushing out of the improvement in the business for us. But tweaking the strategy, yes, but no fundamental change to it.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Got it. Thanks a lot and congratulation on a good quarter.", "Thomas Lynch", "Thank you, Amit.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next we'll go to the line of Shawn Harrison Longbow Research.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Hi, I'm going to beat networks maybe dead in a bit. But even margins flat year-over-year I would have thought with the metals tailwind with a little bit of restructuring you would have been able to do better. Is the margin at DataCom that much richer compared to everything else in the business and so that with DataCom being down so substantially year-over-year explains why margins would have been a little bit better?", "Robert Hau", "There is a number of points in I think Shawn around all that. The telecom business is growing and improving. The SubCom business is one of the lowest points in the last six or seven years. So we're getting really zero leverage out of that business right now. And we think we're at the bottom as I said earlier. The DataCom business is, it's in a turnaround really for us, there is no question about that. So it has the potential for high margins. We did write a few assets off in networks, which further took a low margin lower but we think there is opportunity improvement, but it's not going to be sudden, we're going to need more volume.", "I feel good about the cost structure because as you pointed out, we did take costs out we're just not getting the volume to take advantage of that right now. But in telecom, we have a leading product line in fiber optic, in SubCom we have a leading product line. In DataCom we trail although for the future, we have a good product line but that's got to turn into reality. And in enterprise we have a solid product line in that business is historically a low growth business and we're right in there with that.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "But let's say I take an optimistic, glass half-full view and two years out DataCom recovers, is the margin profile in that business better than kind of the networking average which should be mid teens and so you would get a I guess a greater lift as that business accelerates, is that what really needs to happen?", "Thomas Lynch", "Yes, we need more revenue and we need particularly the industry to start moving to high speed. When you dissect that business without getting into too much detail, the high-speed stuff is a lost leader and our core business while we're not a leader in mid to low speed solutions, it's a solid business. We're just, we've been investing a fair amount in high-speed fiber and copper and so with very little revenue in there, it has the effect of exacerbating the margin on a downward -- in a downward way in that business.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Okay. And then just as a brief follow up. Bob, I think last quarter was $60 million to $70 million in restructuring savings that were supposed to benefit the model this year, did that change?", "Robert Hau", "We're actually seeing slightly better than that. Right now restructuring is a little bit close to $70 million to $80 million.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Then the aggregate number of $100 million, did that change at all?", "Robert Hau", "No, a little north of that which is what we have been saying previously.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Okay. Thanks so much and congrats on the quarter and guidance.", "Thomas Lynch", "Thank you.", "Robert Hau", "Thanks Shawn.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go to the line of Jim Suva with Citi.", "Jim Suva - Citi", "Thank you and congratulations to you and your team there on good results. A quick financial question for Bob and that's on restructuring followed by a more fundamental question probably for your team. But I think you'd mentioned that restructuring looks like its going to be coming down lower this year. Can you help us quantify that a bit more, I think you gave a little bit of numbers there. And is that then a recurring rate sustainable at that or were you looking at lower rate one-time this year, and if so it appears like this rate could be so low.", "Are we looking at folding it into your normal operations? Then for the more operational question, when we look at content growth for vehicles, I think in the past you gave some commentary in kind of long-term 6% to 8%. With cars going more and more to hybrid and safety and emissions always continuing to improve. Is there a chance of that 6% to 8% actually starts to increase or goes to the higher end or even above the higher end of that? Thank you.", "Robert Hau", "Yes, Jim. It's Bob. On the restructuring, we spend about $7 million this quarter roughly inline with what we anticipated previous guidance and still guidance today is about $50 million on a full year basis that's down dramatically from prior years. Last year we spent just north of $300 million. And we think ongoing natural restructuring charges of -- business of our size given the nature of our markets and then customers, it's probably $50 million to $75 million. So we're a bit below \u201cnormal\u201d right now that's largely given the amount we spent last year.", "And as we've said before, we talked a little bit about in our Investor Day, we are looking at ways to fold it in. I think it's important to describe it and disclose it externally whether investors dial it out or roll it back in, it's up to them, we'll give them the information. One of the big reasons that we still have today adjusted earnings versus GAAP earnings and we're still dealing with the tax sharing agreement pre-split and some of those numbers can move significantly, would be very disingenuous to only talk about GAAP earnings. But we certainly look to a) settling the tax sharing agreement over the next couple of years and b) much lower restructuring charges.", "Thomas Lynch", "Hey, Jim. On your other question, we've typically talked about content of 4% to 6% and I do think that there is more likely for that to go higher than lower that's the way I would say. And I walked around in Detroit last week and walked through the auto show and you can feel it you really, I mean we obviously see it in our business and its our biggest business, when you see 100 cars on the floor and you can track them with the features they have versus the prior iteration of a particular model you can feel it.", "So I do think, it's more likely to go up slightly than down, those at a metered pace just because of the product cycles and it doesn't happen over night, designing new features but it's a really good trend and its why we're excited about the business so much.", "We -- also historical production rates that tended to be 2% to 3%, we think for the next few years or the industry I should say think that could be up a point, a point and a half and that was a very, very low growth in demand for local demand in Europe. I think that most of the trends are positive. In China, you have dealers starting to finally expand in the tier three to six cities, so you\u2019re going to \u2013 we expect to continue to have a robust automotive market there. So the combination of more likely upside in production than downside versus the historical rate and more likely upside in content than outside, I think makes it a very attractive market for many, many years.", "Jim Suva \u2013 Citi", "Great. I think I got my numbers. Of the 4% to 6% that is content growth and 6% to 8% is then when you add on the global SAR or the global units of auto production and so 6% to 8% is what the sales rate is and content of 4% to 6% is that kind of what you're seeing?", "Thomas Lynch", "Yes. That's what we're seeing. And that's and of course netted into that is price, which is moving up a little but where as you can see in our margins we're able to give the customer the price that they need and keep the margins moving in the right direction.", "Jim Suva \u2013 Citi", "Great. Thank you and congratulations again to you and your team.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from Mark Delaney, Goldman Sachs.", "Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs", "Great. Thanks very much for taking the question and congratulations on a strong quarter. I don't understand on the margins there has been a tremendous amount of year-over-year improvement in the adjusted operating margin, 14.6% this December quarter versus about 12.5% a year prior.", "I am hoping you can help me understand within the March quarter guidance maybe the bridge from last year. So specifically, by my math, the March quarter implied operating margin guidance is right around 15%?", "And then the revenue level at the midpoint is pretty similar to the revenue that you guys did for the September 2013 quarter. I would think that there is maybe some metal pricing benefits versus the September 2013 quarter and then some restructuring benefits that are coming through. Given that you did the 15.7% in the September quarter, I'm just trying to hope you can walk me through how you are thinking about getting to the 15% or so in the March quarter of fiscal 2014?", "Thomas Lynch", "I'd describe it, Mark, is steady -- continued steady volume growth where we'll get the lift there. The metal difference isn't that much from two quarters ago. It's been a nice tailwind but it's not that much incremental. We are investing more there is no question so we are -- we believe continuing the strength in the product line and just continuing to invest in the emerging markets and engineering and selling. So we are continuing to invest. But over all would expect to continue to drive the margin up and we were pleased with the productivity.", "Our price erosion is up a little bit not dramatically but there is no question that has typically happened with particularly copper hanging around at this rate for a while relative to where it was 18 months ago that customers are expecting appropriately some of that back. So we have pluses and minuses but net-net very good momentum in the margin.", "Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs", "Understood. Thank you for that. For my follow-up question at the Analyst Day Tom and Bob, you guys talked about looking at doing a more acquisitions, I think may be on the tuck-in type of size. Can you give us an update on how that's progressing?", "Thomas Lynch", "Well, it's -- we did the two big once and we've been continuing to build our pipeline especially focused in anything related to transportation and the broader industrial markets. So we keep plugging a way there, it's an active pipeline. We're always talking to people but we're thoughtful about it. Number one, really fit strategically and obviously we would be -- got to be able to create value with it. But we expect it to be a \u2013 an important part of how we grow the company on an ongoing basis. But we feel good about the organic momentum particularly obviously in transportation and industrial and we have to continue to \u2013 we have to get it going in the other two.", "Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs", "", "I understood. Thanks and congratulations again on a good quarter.", "Thomas Lynch", "", "Thank you, Mark.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Next, we'll go to line of William Stein with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I'm hoping you can clarify the comments about the changes in demand in the automotive end market related to the new emission standard. I assume you are talking about Euro 6. Can you clarify whether that relates to light cars or a heavy trucks and to verify your comments about pull-in in light cars to get ahead of this rollout?", "Thomas Lynch", "Yes, well, let me \u2013 I'm glad you asked. So I can clarify it. It's really in the truck market for instance. So that's where we see what looks like accelerated demand we've had, the older version trucks because the new ones are more expensive, not an unusual thing in this market it's not the major thing driving us. We believe improving economic environment plus the age of the trucks on the road are an even bigger part of that. But clearly for the first half of this year the very high growth rates of course in the industrial transportation which is only 15% of transportation are being driven by the \u2013 our customers ordering are really good.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "", "Great. That's helpful. And if I can ask one follow-up. I'm hoping to hear a bit about demand in inventories in the channel relative to your direct business.", "Thomas Lynch", "The channel was a little bit slower in December than we expected, it's still a solid business. So we did see the kind of \u2013 it's really not unusual calendar year end inventory tightening. I think not a big number and not different from our expectation kind of in line with our expectation. So when you look at it more sequentially from our fourth quarter into the first quarter definitely a little bit softer because of adjustment. But, I don't see any overhang or anything like that out there and talking to our distributor partners.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Great. Thank you.", "Thomas Lynch", "Thanks Will.", "Operator", "", "We have a question from Sherri Scribner, Deutsche Bank.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "", "Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to dig a little bit into the improvement you're expecting in the second half of the year in networking and consumer business. I know you talked about some orders that you're anticipating. And it sounded like you're expecting some additional strength in the SubCom market. So I was just hoping for a little more detail on the strength in the networking piece in the second half of the year.", "Thomas Lynch", "Networks, we'll typically have a seasonal peak. So in telecom especially primarily in telecom weather get better, we see the business pick up. So we're really in that business pretty much looking for a similar pick up first half, second half that we saw last year. SubCom is much more related to contracts coming into force and the big thing is we're counting on two contracts to drive that. We got the contract, find the contracts all that. So we would expect that they'll go into force but until they do anything can happen. So that's a big thing driving network. In consumer, it is a little more of continuing to getting traction.", "In appliance, I would say if the economy continues to improve, that business naturally follows the economy. So that's less seasonal and more economic related. Consumer of course has its peak in the quarter, the quarter and a half before the Christmas season. But we're not looking for anything dramatic in the second half in the consumer business and even relatively and that's a small business for us. So relatively it's nice but absolutely in terms of it, affect on the overall company is kind of a penny a quarter, I think Bob in that range. So it's not a big lever. We're trying to make it a bigger lever.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "", "Okay. And then based on the guidance if I do the math, it looks like it's a midpoint for your fiscal 2014 guidance at $14 billion in revenue. Your operating margins are somewhere around 15.5%, I know you've said that you could do plus 15% but are you comfortable with sort of a 15.5% operating margin for the year and that would suggest some decent operating margin leverage in the second half?", "Robert Hau", "", "Yes, sure. At midpoint to that $14 billion the operating margin is above 15.3%. And yes, export we are comfortable with that given the progress we saw going through much of last year and in the first quarter around overall benefits of our lien initiatives what we thought TEOA as well as the improved benefits from restructurings and metals tailwind gives us confident so that, that 15.3% and that generates the $3.75 earnings at mid-point.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Is that assuming that SG&A is relatively flat from first quarter levels or do you see some declines in that based on the productivity improvements? Thanks.", "Robert Hau", "Overall for the year, SG&A is about 13.5% of sales.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thank you.", "Robert Hau", "Thanks.", "Thomas Lynch", "Thanks Sherri.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. We have a question from Steven Fox, Cross Research.", "Steven Fox - Cross Research", "", "Thanks. Good morning. Just going back to the operating margins for a second, if I look at the transportation and industrial margins, it seems like there was a greater drop through effect on both sides of the business on a quarter-over-quarter basis. So on the positive sales from transportation you pull down greater than average drop through and the reverse was happening on industrial. Can you just sort of breakdown how much more was related to metals in those segments versus \u2013 I don't believe there was a lot of restructuring but what else was driving that because I'm just (inaudible) those numbers? Thanks.", "Robert Hau", "Hi, Steve. I think I'd point to the two things. Number one, better volume better revenue left in those two segments so you'd get the benefit of the buying leverage into our factories. And then from a metal standpoint in particular relative to networks, the other three segment that's much more metal content. So you see that $15 million or $16 million of year-over-year benefit really layered into the other three segments where networks doesn't participate. All of our businesses clearly involved in TEOA and lead, but there is a significant extra lever when you get volume leverage.", "Thomas Lynch", "But when you compare auto or transportation or industrial as well is -- there is sales per part in transportation higher so that's a higher volume business than industrial sales. You're not going to typically have the same fall through but we feel in the industrial business overall there is nice opportunity to fund the metal margin improvement through TEOA, we'll further along with that in transportation than we are in industrial, so we expect to see the same kind of improvements.", "Steven Fox - Cross Research", "", "Great. That's helpful. And then just quick follow up on China, Tom. Given how fast it is growing, could you just talk a little bit about within the China market especially on the auto side where you think you're picking up share from a content standpoint, is it helping or hurting the overall content growth for the company within auto given the mix differences and why you think you're picking up that share little bit more color would be helpful. Thanks.", "Thomas Lynch", "Sure, thanks. Well, I think the momentum piece is, I mean we've been in China a long time and we are \u2013 I mean our whole team is local. So, we have a very, very strong seasoned team that is a local team that's been in the business a long time that's been developed by our other teams around the world. So we have a lot of know-how there and we work with every customer. And we bring the bear the technologies from the other parts of the world. We're strong. We're as strong with the local customers as we are with the multinationals. While the content per vehicle in the locally produced cars is less, it's rapidly rising at a greater rate because in order to compete in that market you have to have the features that the multinationals have.", "So, I think that while the overall contents for vehicle in China is less than it is. And Germany for sure it's raising at a faster rate. And in China for the local customers, we provide a much -- in some cases a much broader product range than we do other places because the customers need the expertise. So that has helped us, that four, five years ago we decided to kind of get \u2013 I don't want to take services in the sense that we charge for services because we don't really do that, but we help a lot in the design of the electrical system for the local customers because they wanted to help. So that's helped us. That helped us a lot. And you just see the continued expansion and especially demand for high-end cars. So while the low end car, overall there is lower content, you are selling a lot of premium cars particularly from Germany into that market where we have a significant content.", "Steven Fox - Cross Research", "That's very helpful. Yes. Thanks very much. I appreciate it.", "Thomas Lynch", "Thanks Steve.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Amitabh Passi from UBS.", "Amitabh Passi - UBS", "Hi. Thank you, Tom. I had a question and then a follow-up. I guess the first one was just a big picture question. It seems to me when you embarked on the ADC acquisition and Deutsch part of the motivation was to sort of diversify your growth drivers and your portfolio. Yet if I look at the numbers today about almost 45% of your sales are coming from transportation and about 60% of your EBIT dollars. So just curious as you look at your portfolio, and I know you touched on this but would like to get more details, is there an appetite maybe to accelerate the inorganic element to continue to sort of balance out the portfolio, both from a growth and profitability perspective?", "Thomas Lynch", "Amitabh, I would say the way the underlying strategy of Deutsch was harsh environment. So with our sweet spot, what we are best at and where we think the most value we can add and the most value we can extract is in the really harsh environment. And so we are not \u2013 I'm not worried at all about the transportation business getting bigger if it's for natural reasons, right, the market is growing, we are strong. We do well there. The customers really value the full value proposition we bring to support them in every part of the world.", "I think the industrial business benefited from those two, so half of the revenue it came from Deutsch, half one in transportation, half one into our industrial solutions business and (inaudible) which \u2013 now we have the almost $1.1 billion business as a result of that acquisition. And again, enabling us to do other things that we wouldn't have otherwise done because of the width of the \u2013 breadth of the product line.", "So if you think of us, we like the harsh environment. That's where we are best at. We are clearly better at it than we are in consumer and DataCom and networks are important to us and we think we have a lot of value add there. But, we are not really on a strategy to try to lessen our participation in transportation because if you just look at the underlying trends there, it's just more content and there is still a long way to go.", "So we want to continue to be strong there. And of course, we want to \u2013 the way, I characterize our four businesses, transportation is a great business and we are really good at it. Industrial is a good business and we are good at it with the opportunity to be better. Network solutions on a mix of solid business, we believe the fiber part is really a good business to be in because the bandwidth demand and we are good at it. And consumer we are getting better but we are not good. And we have a terrific team in there that's changing it and so we view that as opportunity \u2013 selective opportunity as we say.", "So that's how we think of the portfolio and we think all four of the segments need to have the right attention in order to be the best. So we are not really trying to deemphasize transportation.", "Amitabh Passi - UBS", "Okay. Perfect. Then just as a quick follow-up, I would like a little more insight into the telecom networks piece of network solutions. You grew almost 11% year-over-year. I think you are guiding to 5% growth. Verizon seems to be deemphasizing investments in wireline. MDN was the hot topic two years ago, it kind of fizzled out. So just as you look at project activity which areas and regions are you most excited about and why after growing 11% in the first quarter, do you still think it's a mid single-digit growing segment this year?", "Thomas Lynch", "I mean, I think 11% was driven very strong by some wins in South America, some accelerated activity in Europe. We expect those to level off. There is uncertainty around MDN, it's still in an early stage far enough that I don't think anybody is going to turn back if there is a question of how deep will they drive the fiber. And probably won't see everybody get fiber-to-the-home. But it's going to be fiber deep which is still a really good business.", "If you go back to the prior quarter it was a different part of the world, the important thing, the encouraging thing but we need to see it quarter after quarter after quarter is it just more project. So we \u2013 as I think, I said in Investor Day there is a lot more projects in the last year than they were the year before that. But it tend to be a lumpy business.", "Our fundamental belief is that when you model data flow, you got to have the fiber network deeper than it is. You don't have to go fiber-to-the-home to give the consumer a good experience, but you need to have fiber setting the offload even from a LTE network deeper than its generally in the network around the world, which is why we think its 5% to 6% growth business over time. But it does take fortitude to ride through the cycle and last year we took a lot of cost out to make sure that whatever cycle it is that we are probably above cost of capital kind of return.", "So that's how we see it right now. We don't expect 11% growth over the balance of the year.", "Amitabh Passi - UBS", "Okay. Got it. Thank you so much and good luck.", "Robert Hau", "Thank you.", "Thomas Lynch", "Okay. Well, thank you very much and for those of you like us who fought through the snow to participate, we appreciate it. Again, a good quarter and more than anything I think it reflects a lot of the actions we have taken over the last several years certainly it's very nice to see general economic improvement. We are not giddy about \u2013 hey, all of a sudden we are in the high growth area. We continue to be focused and we look forward to talking to you in the not too distant future.

Welcome to the TE Connectivity F2Q Earnings Call. (Operator instructions.) As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Keith Kolstrom, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Keith Kolstrom", "Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity\u2019s F2Q 2014 results. With me today are Chairman and CEO Tom Lynch and CFO Bob Hau.", "During the course of this call we will be providing certain forward-looking information and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today\u2019s press release. In addition we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning and we ask you to review the section of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items.", "The press release and related tables along with the slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.te.com. Finally I would like to remind everyone to please try to limit themselves to one follow-up question to make sure we\u2019re able to cover all questions during the allotted time.", "Now let me turn the call over to Tom for some opening comments.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks, Keith, and good morning everyone. This was another good quarter for TE Connectivity on many fronts. The majority of the markets we serve are exhibiting solid growth trends and this growth is fairly broad-based across most of the regions of the world. There are still some uncertain spots but overall I am encouraged by the trend. It\u2019s good to see other markets in addition to automotive picking up some steam.", "We\u2019re very well positioned in about 90% of the markets we serve, and virtually all of them have attractive underlying drivers which require more of our highly-engineered connectivity products. The concept of the Internet of Things is real and we are seeing it across almost all of our customers. I feel we are in an excellent position to be able to capitalize on these trends because of the range of our technology and the extensive resources we have close to the customer around the globe.", "Our operational performance also continues to improve. This quarter we delivered adjusted operating margin of 15.5%, up 190 basis points from last year; and we\u2019re on track to deliver 15.0% + adjusted operating margins for the full year. Strong productivity driven by our TEOA program, and this is our business system that encompasses Lean Six Sigma and engineering design productivity coupled with a much more balanced footprint has resulted in very good operating leverage in most of our businesses. We\u2019re also benefiting from our strategic focus of building our harsh environment product portfolio. ", "The company continues to generate strong cash flow, with six straight years of free cash flow yield at or above 10% of revenue. This gives us the flexibility to execute important strategic acquisitions such as SEACON which I\u2019ll discuss a bit more further on while still returning two-thirds of our cash flow to shareholders over time. Our philosophy is a balanced approach which emphasizes organic investment, strategic acquisitions, and returning cash to shareholders through consistent dividend growth and share repurchase.", "Overall the world feels more solid economically than it has in a while and we are well positioned to capitalize on this. Now let\u2019s go to the slides.", "Please turn to Slide 3. Revenues in F2Q were in line with expectation and adjusted earnings per share was above out guidance range. We continued to see improvement in many of our end markets and the fall through to operating income on the year-over-year sales increases was strong. ", "Here are some highlights of the quarter: organically sales were up 6% overall and up 7% excluding Sub Commp. The automotive, aerospace, oil & gas, industrial and telecom businesses drove this growth. This more than offset expected declines in the consumer devices and Data Comm businesses and continued project delays in our Sub Comm business.", "Adjusted earnings per share of $0.95 was up 25% versus last year and $0.05 better than the midpoint of our guidance. As I mentioned earlier adjusted operating margins were 15.5%, up 190 basis points over the prior year, and we remain on track to exceed 15.0% for the full year as we continue to deliver strong operational performance across the majority of our businesses.", "Free cash flow was $273 million and we returned $281 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. The annual dividend was increased 16% to $1.16 per share by our shareholders last month at our annual general meeting. This increase will be effective with the June dividend payment. This represents the fourth consecutive year of double-digit dividend increases.", "Our orders increased 4% organically in the quarter and our book-to-bill was 1.03, excluding Sub Commp. Orders growth was broad based with growth in all regions and in line with our expectations.", "For the full year we are raising the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.03 to $3.78. This is an increase of $0.17 versus our prior year performance. In the second half we expect solid growth in the transportation markets and continued steady improvement in most of our industrial markets. This, coupled with our strong F2Q performance, will more than offset continued delays in Sub Comm projects.", "The $3.78 compares to our original guidance six months ago of $3.65, a 13% increase. We entered this fiscal year expecting to deliver strong results and are on track to beat those original expectations. ", "Please turn to Slide 4. We announced the planned acquisition of the SEACON Group on April 2nd. This transaction is another step in strengthening our leadership in higher growth harsh environment applications. SEACON has a 50-year history of supplying connectivity solutions for underwater applications, one of the harshest environments where superior quality and performance are required. Their leading portfolio of products and technologies is a very complimentary fit with our existing solutions for the underwater oil & gas markets.", "We currently have a nice business of about $150 million in revenue that has had solid double-digit growth over the last five years. The addition of SEACON will add over $115 million of revenue and bring our total business to $250 million. We\u2019ll also double our served market to over 1 billion. We expect to continue to generate double-digit revenue growth in this market going forward as this acquisition positions us with the leading product offering.", "I first had the opportunity to meet the owners of SEACON several years ago. They have built a great business and an outstanding team. The acquisition is expected to be accretive in year one excluding one-time costs and will be reported in the Aerospace, Defense, Oil & Gas business within our Industrial Solutions segment. ", "We\u2019re very excited to welcome the SEACON group to TE. As we mentioned in our press release we expect the acquisition to be finalized in the current fiscal year. Terrence Curtin, who is the President of our Industrial Solutions segment is here and available for questions on this subject in the Q&A section.", "I\u2019ll now provide some detail by business within each segment in the next four slides. Unless I indicate otherwise all changes are on an organic basis which excludes the effects of currencies, acquisitions, and divestitures. Please turn to Slide 5.", "Transportation had another great quarter. Sales of $1.57 billion were up 13% over the prior year and orders were up 7% with a booked to bill of 1.0. Global auto demand continues to be solid and auto production in Europe was up both sequentially and versus the prior year driven by exports and importantly improving global demand.", "Global vehicle production in the quarter was about 21.5 million units, up 5% from last year. Revenue from the industrial transportation business was again very strong in the quarter due to overall strength in the truck market and the impact of emissions standards changes in Europe and China. And just a comment, our TE and Deutsche Industrial Transportation businesses are now fully integrated and performing very, very well.", "Transportation revenues grew double digits in all regions this quarter. Europe was up 12% as I mentioned earlier due to strong exports and improvement in local demand, and in Europe new car registrations were up in the March quarter.", "In the Americas revenues were up 10% due to continued solid demand and share gain. Asia revenues were up 18%, with a 34% increase in our business in China and 12% in Japan. We\u2019re the leader in China and continue to grow faster than the market. We continue to invest aggressively in talent and capacity there to further strengthen this position.", "Our margin improvement was due to a combination of favorable mix with heavy trucks in the industrial transportation market, the operating leverage that came with our volume increases and productivity improvements driven by our TEOA program.", "As I mentioned last quarter we expect revenue growth in mid- to high-single digits in the second half as we do expect some moderation in the year-over-year auto production growth rates, which is typical. We expect adjusted margins to remain at or above the 20% level.", "Please turn to Page 6. Market demand in the Industrial Solutions segment was in line with our expectations in F2Q. Revenues were up 4% and orders were up 2% versus the prior year. We are seeing a continued recovery in the industrial equipment business, with revenues up 8% driven by demand in the factory automation and high-speed rail markets. The commercial aerospace and oil & gas markets were up 5% and continue to have strong demand. We expect this to continue for the balance of the year.", "As expected, our energy business was down slightly in the quarter as demand softened, particularly with emerging market customers in Europe. Adjusted operating margins continue to improve and were up 70 basis points versus the prior year as a result of the increased volumes, the benefits of accelerated restructuring and productivity increases. Looking forward we expect another good quarter in F3Q with sales up mid-single digits versus the prior year and continuing margin improvement.", "Please turn to Page 7. Sales in the Network segment were down about 1% versus the prior year. This was mostly in line with our guidance except further weakness in the Sub Comm business caused by additional project delays. Excluding Sub Comm sales were up 2% organically.", "The Telecom Networks business grew 6% in the quarter driven by increased investment in fiber optic networks particularly in Europe. The Enterprise business was up 5% due primarily to strength in the Americas. Our Data Comm business was down 7% in line with our expectations.", "The Sub Comm business is very slow as the timing of awarded projects coming into force continues to delay. We now project second half revenue of $150 million with full-year expectations down about $100 million from our prior guidance and from prior year. And due to these delays in the current quarter we are anticipating a loss in Sub Comm in F3Q.", "On a positive note, the AAE1 project which was announced yesterday, and this is a major project that connects Asia with Europe worth more than $500 million, came into force last week and we expect to begin the project late in the quarter. And when we say \u201ccame into force\u201d that means we\u2019ve got a sizable down payment. ", "This has been a very tough year in the Sub Comm market but we are very well positioned with our wins over the last two years, and I remain confident that demand for bandwidth will drive another build cycle.", "Adjusted operating margins in the segment were down slightly versus the prior year driven by the sales decline in Sub Comm and Data Comm. We do expect seasonal second half pickup in the Telecom and Data Comm businesses. Overall segment revenue should be up about 10% versus the first half.", "So to digest the Networks business, the Telecom, Wireless and Enterprise businesses which comprise about $2 billion annual revenue are growing again this year after a couple years\u2019 of decline and margins for the year will be double digits. Sub Comm is we believe at the very bottom now and the Data Comm business is starting to level out. And on a positive note there are investments in high-speed solutions that are starting to take hold.", "Please turn to Slide 8. Revenue in our Consumer Solutions business was down 3% versus the prior year. This was in line with our expectations as lower customer demand in the consumer devices business more than offset growth of 5% in the appliances business. We continue to see improving trends in the appliance market where we have the leading market share and very attractive operating margins.", "Adjusted operating margins in the segment were similar to the prior year despite the revenue decline due to the restructuring savings and metals tailwinds. In F3Q we expect revenues to be up slightly versus the prior year.", "Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Bob to cover the financials in more detail.", "Bob Hau", "Thanks, Tom, and good morning everyone. Let me discuss earnings which start on Slide 9.", "Adjusted operating income was $532 million, up 20% versus the prior year. GAAP operating income was $510 million and included $21 million of restructuring charges, 35% of which was in the Networks segment, and $1 million of acquisition-related charges in the quarter. We continue to anticipate full-year restructuring charges of approximately $50 million for the full year.", "Adjusted operating margin was 15.5%, up 190 basis points from F2Q last year. The improvement versus the prior year is driven by the 6% organic sales growth, productivity from TEOA, cost savings from restructuring actions taken the last couple of years, and favorable metals costs.", "Adjusted EPS was $0.95 and GAAP EPS was $0.87 for the quarter. GAAP EPS included $0.03 of restructuring and other charges and $0.05 of charges related to the legacy shared tax liabilities. These tax charges are consistent with our overall expectations of settlement of these pre-separation tax issues.", "Turning to Slide 10, our gross margin in the quarter was 34.2%. This is a 200 basis point increase versus the prior year due to volume increases, increased productivity from our TEOA Lean programs, and a cost savings from restructuring and metals. ", "Total OPEX spending was $641 million in the quarter, which was up 5% versus the prior year. The increase resulted primarily from increased investments in sales and marketing and increased variable compensation costs, partially offset by cost savings attributed to restructuring actions.", "On the right side of this slide, net interest expense was $26 million in the quarter and I expect $26 million to $27 million of expense in both F3Q and F4Q going forward. Adjusted other income, which primarily relates to our tax sharing agreement, was $2 million. In F3Q I expect other income of about $8 million.", "The adjusted effective tax rate was 21.7% which was lower than expected. This is partially offset by the lower other income and gave us a net benefit of about $0.02 to earnings per share. Overall the adjusted tax rate for the first half of the year was 23.8% and I expect the adjusted tax rate to be in the 24.0% range through the remainder of the fiscal year.", "Turning to Slide 11 I\u2019ll discuss our balance sheet and free cash flow. Cash from continuing operations was $453 million and our free cash flow in F2Q was $273 million. Net capital spending during the quarter was $159 million or 4.6% of sales and I continue to expect the capital spending rate to be approximately 4.0% to 5.0% of sales for the full year.", "Receivable days outstanding were 63 days and inventory days on hand were 73 days, each up two days versus the prior year. Inventory levels were slightly elevated as we expect increased revenues in a number of our businesses in the second half.", "Now let me discuss sources and uses of cash outside of free cash flow, shown on the right side of this slide. We began and ended the quarter with $1.4 billion of cash. During the quarter we returned a total of $281 million to shareholders. We paid dividends of $102 million and repurchased about 3.1 million shares for $179 million. As Tom mentioned earlier we expect the SEACON acquisition of $490 million to close in the current fiscal year. Outstanding debt remained at $3 billion at the end of the quarter. ", "Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Tom.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks, Bob. Please turn to Slide 12 and I\u2019ll cover our outlook. Based on the trends I discussed earlier we expect F3Q revenue of $3.54 billion to $3.64 billion, up 3% to 6%. The project delays in Sub Comm are negatively impacting our growth rates by approximately 1%. We expect adjusted EPS of $0.96 to $1.00 which is an increase of 9% to 14% over the prior year.", "In F3Q we expect continued strong results from both the Transportation and Industrial segment. The Consumer segment is expected to be up slightly, and Networks excluding Sub Comm is expected to be about flat versus the prior year.", "Please turn to Slide 13. For the full year we expect revenue of $13.8 billion to $14.1 billion, up 4% to 6% versus the prior year. We expect adjusted EPS of $3.72 to $3.84, an increase of 15% to 19%. Relative to prior guidance the story is Transportation is stronger and Sub Comm is weaker.", "We expect to have another very strong year of cash flow and we\u2019re using that cash in a manner that is consistent with the plan we have discussed over the last several years, namely investing to grow the business organically with investments in manufacturing capability and capacity in emerging markets as well as increased investments in R&D and sales and marketing, strategic acquisitions like the SEACON Group that accelerate growth in attractive markets and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. ", "Just to close I\u2019m encouraged by the positive signs in most of our markets we serve and feel very good about our overall execution. I really believe we\u2019re well positioned for future growth and expect to deliver strong performance for the remainder of the fiscal year and beyond. So now let\u2019s open it up for questions.", "", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator instructions.) And our first question comes from the line of Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Mark Delaney \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thanks very much for taking the question. Tom, I was hoping if first you could elaborate a little bit more on the outlook for the Sub Comm business. I understand it\u2019s weaker in the near term but you also mentioned a new award coming into force, and maybe you can help us understand with the order pipeline what that implies for revenue potential in the subsea business as you start to think into F2015.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks, Mark. As you know we\u2019re not really going to talk about F2015 until the end of the year but in the Sub Comm business, there\u2019s really three components of the business. The biggest part is building the communications systems and that\u2019s the piece that\u2019s really down right now because of the project push-outs. The smaller pieces are maintenance and our oil & gas business which is fairly steady. And this AAE1 award which we were awarded many months ago but it took a while to come into force is good news but it\u2019s happening a lot later than we thought, which means that we\u2019re underutilizing our assets right now.", "As that comes into force late this quarter, early next quarter, we believe that\u2019ll start to ramp. There\u2019s several other projects that we\u2019ve been awarded that are close to coming into force but they\u2019ve also been taking longer. So I think once we get two to three projects to complement sort of the ongoing business, then we\u2019ll start to ride up the upswing of the cycle.", "Mark Delaney \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "That makes sense, thank you for that. And then for my follow-up question I\u2019m hoping we can get a little more detail on the recently proposed acquisition of SEACON. I mean what are the expectations there in terms of margins and if you plan to do any restructuring in that business, or if it\u2019s already having a cost structure that you expect it to have longer term.", "Tom Lynch", "I\u2019ll say a few things and then I\u2019ll ask Terrence to elaborate. I\u2019d say this isn\u2019t really a cost synergy play; this is an expanded market play. So we\u2019re really doubling the size of our served market and bringing a full system now to the customer. So that\u2019s the attractive part and it\u2019s higher than company margins for sure because of the very highly engineered and extreme harsh environment nature of the business. Terrence, do you want to elaborate on that?", "Terrence Curtin", "Sure, Tom. Hello everyone. When you look at SEACON, I think a couple of things maybe to paint a picture of where we play today in the underwater space from an interconnect perspective and what SEACON brings to us. First off, when you look at our position today we\u2019re exposed to about a $400 million market which is very focused on high-performance cable as well as connections around the power element.", "SEACON very nicely has about $115 million of revenue. It is extremely profitable; about 30% plus EBITDA, and when you look at it it really opens up our market from $400 million to over $1 billion as Tom said. So what they bring is really along the optical and fiber side, connections that happen underwater \u2013 they\u2019re very wet-matable. And when we look at this market overall we\u2019ve been able to basically grow our small position from $70 million to over $150 million today. ", "What it really does is give us a rounded out portfolio in some of the harshest environments, and we believe with the combined portfolio, with the trends we see in underwater and oil & gas, we\u2019ll be able to continue to grow the combined well north of double-digit growth going forward. So we\u2019re happy with the acquisition and what it brings.", "To Tom\u2019s point it is very much around growth and really making sure we capitalize on this market that is a very fast-growing market, and one of the fastest in the industrial space from a segment perspective.", "Mark Delaney \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Wamsi Mohan \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yes, thank you, good morning. Tom, in Networks you\u2019ve been divesting $20 million or so of revenues each quarter over the last two quarters. Can you tell us what these underperforming assets are and how much more there is to go? And I have a follow-up.", "Tom Lynch", "Sure, thanks Wamsi. In Data Comm we did that last year and we\u2019re coming to the end of the compare, but we were in for a long time the magnetics business \u2013 basically coils that are used to help set frequencies in these products, really a commodity product that had a number of competitors. So it just didn\u2019t fit the kind of highly engineered criteria that we have for our business.", "You take that out, the business is down single digits. Some of that is market; some of that is clearly we\u2019re kind of a mid-tier player in the current 15 GB speeds, but that\u2019s pretty much behind us, the exit of product lines in that business.", "Wamsi Mohan \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay great, thanks. And in the Networks business clearly Sub Comm has a large negative impact on margins, but can you give us some sense how the ex-Sub Comm margins trended in the segment in the current quarter and how much restructuring benefits flowed into this quarter? Thanks.", "Tom Lynch", "Yeah, I\u2019d say just generally commenting on the comments, the Telecom, Enterprise and Wireless piece, which we would think of together as our broadband business, which is about a $2 billion annual business, margins trended up in the quarter and they\u2019re trending up in the year. And that business as I said was down 4% last year; it\u2019s up 4% this year and that\u2019s two thirds of the segment.", "In Data Comm margins are still down. That\u2019s really two components: our core connector business is improving and we\u2019re making a sizable investment in high-speed copper and fiber because that\u2019s where the world is going. And we want to lead there, and early wins position us well but that\u2019s not going to become serious revenue for a few years. And the Sub Comm margins are way down because the volume\u2019s way down.", "Wamsi Mohan \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie. Please go ahead.", "Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "Hi, thank you. In Automotive, your view for 1% to 2% EMEA growth for next quarter, I\u2019m curious how that floats with the kind of mid-single digit growth we\u2019re seeing in vehicle registrations in Western Europe exiting the quarter roughly at a 10% growth rate. I\u2019m curious what the production versus demand trends are you\u2019re seeing there.", "Tom Lynch", "Yeah, you\u2019re talking about the production growth in Europe.", "Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "Yes.", "Tom Lynch", "Yeah, I mean that\u2019s what the industry\u2019s projecting right now and it\u2019s corroborated by what our customers are guiding us on to produce relative to local production. But remember we have consistently grown in Europe as well as some of the higher-end vehicle makers there because so much of their product is exported. ", "I think what\u2019s really positive about this is there\u2019s absolutely overall growth in Europe locally, so that says that the economy\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s not robust by any stretch but it\u2019s improving and that\u2019s broadening the base of car sales over there; whereas we\u2019ve really benefitted up until the last two quarters by the export market which is a high content market. This is putting a broader base on it.", "Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "Okay, and can you also comment on there was a large telco carrier in the US that just announced plans to roll out fiber in the US in a number of cities \u2013 what trends just that you\u2019re seeing overall in terms of the fiber deployment and whether or not you\u2019re seeing any pricing pressure in that segment as those carriers increase CAPEX in that area.", "Tom Lynch", "Mike, it\u2019s really a carrier-by-carrier thing around the world. So that particular carrier you\u2019re talking about, well we do well with all the carriers in the US and we\u2019re benefitting from that. A little more pricing pressure than normal, which with the fiber volume up\u2026 This is the second year in a row where the fiber portion in the Networks, our revenue is up double digits. ", "And one interesting thing that\u2019s happening in that market is the copper piece is finally getting to a small enough piece where the decline in copper isn\u2019t directly offsetting fiber, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re starting to see the growth because carriers are investing in the fiber portion of the business. And that 4% I talked about, that 4% to 5% that we expect to grow this year, that\u2019s closer to high-single digits in fiber. So we are definitely seeing it.", "There\u2019s a lot of positive trends I would say \u2013 new players announcing they\u2019re going to build fiber networks, net neutrality kind of wearing down in the US, of course just the tremendous requirement for more bandwidth. So the trends look better right now, feel better, are better I would say \u2013 those underlying trends \u2013 than they have been for a long time as drivers for our part of the business, so we\u2019re optimistic but we need to see it turn into a higher revenue growth rate for sure.", "Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And now we\u2019ll go to the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Perfect, thanks, good morning guys. Two questions from me, one just on capital allocation \u2013 can you just touch on your capital allocation thought process as you get through the back of the year, or given the fact that you have to have a cash outlay of $490 million for SEACON does that change the buyback process on a go forward basis at all?", "Bob Hau", "Thanks, Amit, this is Bob. Overall as you know our capital strategy is broadly set around continuing strong free cash flow which we anticipate will approximate net income out into the future; and that allows us to fund the capital requirements of the business. In order of priority we\u2019ll continue to fund organically \u2013 that\u2019s capital investments as well as R&D that we spend 4% to 5% of sales and capital. We spend about 5% in R&D and we anticipate that continuing out into the future.", "After the organic investments we\u2019re certainly looking for value-creating strategic acquisitions. And then long-term over a period of time we expect two thirds of our cash to go back to shareholders through dividends which we\u2019ve been increasing as earnings increase \u2013 a s Tom pointed out in the upfront comments four years in a row of double-digit increases, and as recently as last month a 16% increase for the annual dividend. And we also do share buyback.", "And the SEACON acquisition perfectly aligned with that strategy. It\u2019s a $500 million, $490 million of cash outflow, we\u2019ll pay with cash on the balance sheet.", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Got it. And I guess, Tom, I was wondering if you could maybe spend some time talking about how do you think about divestures broadly on a go-forward basis or when to deemphasize parts of your business? I recall that when you guys had actually spun out a telco divesture is actually a very big part of the story of how you guys were able to improve margins. I\u2019m curious, as you look at your portfolio, especially the networking piece of your business or parts of it, how do you evaluate divestures on a go-forward basis?", "Tom Lynch", "Well, a couple ways, Amit. I think first and foremost when we came out and looked at the portfolio and shored up the strategy around connectivity there had to be a couple criteria, right? It had to be related to the strengths we had. So we weren\u2019t interested if the most part of the business had no relation to the rest of the businesses and we couldn\u2019t leverage our strengths, so that\u2019s why we did quite a bit. I\u2019d say the portfolio we have now is all related to connectivity, and when you think of the internet of things there\u2019s the network that enables that and there\u2019s everything that\u2019s connected to it, and we\u2019re right in the middle of both of those.", "So we like that position very much. Networks has been a slow business for sure the last couple years but I\u2019m still very bullish on the underlying dynamics, all the things I mentioned on the last question, that say they\u2019re going to drive it. So if you look at the telecom, enterprise, wireless, you\u2019ve got to push fiber more into the network. And even if you don\u2019t believe in fiber to the home, high bandwidth to the home with a small cell network requires a lot more fiber than you have today.", "G.fast, you know, what\u2019s coming in the next generation, call it very, very, very, very fast DSL in the next couple years, needs to be much closer to the home which needs to have a fiber connection to upload it. And then as you just get LTE all over the place you need a much more robust fiber backhaul to take advantage of it.", "So when we look at all those qualities we say there\u2019s going to be investment. We\u2019re starting to see signs of it picking up. We\u2019re seeing a much more broad base of that around the world. So we haven\u2019t changed our fundamental strategic view of the business, so we haven\u2019t changed how we see it fitting in the portfolio.", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Got it. I guess, Tom, initially you made a comment saying you guys are very well positioned in about 90% of the markets you serve. I guess I was curious of what are the 10% you think you\u2019re not well positioned in and is that the divesture potential for you guys?", "Tom Lynch", "Well those two are consumer devices, so that\u2019s about $700 million of revenue where we\u2019re not a lead player there and we don\u2019t have the best sockets. But that\u2019s such a, it\u2019s a core business to us. I mean we do everything there we do every place else, so it\u2019s the same capital, same material, etc. And I\u2019ll say Data Comm but in Data Comm we have tremendous momentum around the next generation of high speed, with the product and the product\u2019s in the market, the product\u2019s been selected by a variety of customers. ", "Now the transition from the current speeds that are out there in datacenters and in the wireless network higher speed takes time, but what I\u2019m really excited about there is the decisions we made over four or five years to develop high speed, they have some proof points now. I\u2019d say both of those businesses are core connector businesses, right? They are part of the h$10.5 billion of what you\u2019d refer to as the Connector business, and that business end-to-end\u2026 Some businesses are stronger than others but overall it\u2019s an incredibly strong business.", "Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Perfect, thanks a lot.", "Tom Lynch", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. And next we\u2019ll go to the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Please go ahead.", "Matt Sheerin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.", "Yes, thanks and good morning. Just a couple of questions from me: on the Industrial Solutions business you had nice year-over-year improvement in operating margin. As you look forward through the rest of the fiscal year do you think you can get those margins to the company average around 15%? And is that coming mostly from leverage on volume or is there more restructuring benefits from that?", "Tom Lynch", "I\u2019d say it\u2019s a combination of things. Clearly the most important thing is volume, but we feel as I mentioned in my earlier comments, we feel good about the momentum and the order rates we\u2019ve seen for the last three quarters continuing into this quarter, support continuing, revenue growth \u2013 we\u2019re in that kind of 4% to 6% revenue growth. That business has very nice operating leverage with the improvements over the last couple of years. ", "So yeah, we expect the margin to continue to march up and I think as we said at Investor Day we see that as a business that over the next couple of years is well over the 15% company average that we have today. So we\u2019re very bullish on that business both from a growth aspect and the markets that we play in and the products we have as well as the improvements in operating leverage that\u2019ll deliver higher margins.", "Matt Sheerin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.", "Okay, thanks. And Bob, you mentioned in your commentary about metals, lower metals costs having a benefit on your gross margin. Can you help quantify that either year-over-year or sequentially and how does that impact your model going forward?", "Bob Hau", "Yeah, year-over-year it was about $17 million, $18 million in the current quarter, F2Q. And we expect about $15 million to $20 million per quarter in the second half of the year, consistent with prior guidance.", "Matt Sheerin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.", "And you\u2019re not seeing any impact on pricing as customers see the benefit of those, the Euro benefits where they\u2019re asking for lower pricing in pass through? ", "Tom Lynch", "Hi Matt, this is Tom. I would say price erosion is up a little bit so it\u2019s hard, you can\u2019t completely look at those two disconnected. The business doesn\u2019t work with kind of across the board increases or decreases; it tends to be negotiation by negotiation. But net of the two it\u2019s a net benefit I\u2019d say because the price erosion increase is less than the benefit we\u2019re getting. If you were to just simply say they take out all the metal tailwinds benefit, how are we doing? We\u2019re still slightly above 15%.", "Matt Sheerin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.", "Okay, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Shawn Harrison from Longbow Research. Please go ahead.", "Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research", "Good morning, Tom. Back of the envelope is it about maybe a $0.03 earnings headwind versus kind of your expectations? And then just also if you could maybe size the total programs, I guess the one that came into force and the ones that could potentially come into force in the next couple quarters?", "Tom Lynch", "Are you talking about Sub Comm, Shawn?", "Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research", "Yes.", "Tom Lynch", "It\u2019s in that range, yeah \u2013 it\u2019s $0.03 to $0.04 from where [we were] in the quarter.", "Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research", "Okay, and just the size of the program that came into force as well as the ones coming into force as far as the opportunity.", "Tom Lynch", "The one that came into force is the biggest one we had in the backlog, about $0.5 billion and the others are less than that \u2013 they\u2019re more in the $150 million to $200 million range and coming into force soon. We\u2019ve been awarded and we work closely with the customers, so if they come into force in the next couple of months that will shore up next year and that\u2019ll be better than next year.", "Bob Hau", "And Shawn, the AAE contract that just came into force, we\u2019ll start that later this quarter and that\u2019ll take us through 2016 to complete that program.", "Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research", "Okay. And then just as a follow-up on networks I see where I guess the telecom, the wireless aspect, even the enterprise coming back \u2013 and you have visibility now into a double-digit EBIT margin in the back half of the year. But if I add everything up it looks as if in terms of over the next two years it\u2019s going to be tough to get to a mid-teens EBIT margin without further restructuring. Do you think further restructuring within Networks is possible or is needed to get to let\u2019s say a 15% EBIT margin?", "Tom Lynch", "I\u2019d answer it this way. If the growth that we expect, seeing signs in Sub Comm, seeing nice signs in broadband and believe that we\u2019re, with the discontinued products and the new products that are coming we should be back into growth in Data Comm. With the restructuring that we\u2019ve done in the last year which is pretty significant, we\u2019ll start to see the benefit with revenues in the segment growing 5% to 6%. ", "If for some reason we\u2019re wrong on that growth rate, again, and it\u2019s a smaller business there is the propensity that we won\u2019t need as much infrastructure. But I don\u2019t believe that, but as we\u2019ve done in the past you\u2019ll see we\u2019ll adjust accordingly. We could march it back up to near that mid-15%. It depends on how fast the growth comes back.", "Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research", "How much restructuring is left in terms of I guess savings to come into the business over the next let\u2019s say 12 to 18 months, in terms of dollar amount?", "Bob Hau", "Overall Shawn, we took obviously a significant amount of restructuring last year across the company and spent a little over $300 million. That\u2019s tailing off dramatically, this year about $50 million. Last year if I recall Networks was about 40% of that spend across the organization. As I indicated in my opening comments we took some restructuring charges of about $21 million in the most recently completed quarter, F2Q. About 75% of that was related to Networks.", "So as Tom pointed out heavy restructuring is behind us. We expect kind of a net benefit of $115 million of run rate savings in 2015 from those restructuring actions. We\u2019re getting about $70 million to $80 million this year, so an incremental $40 million next year.", "Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research", "And the spend would be equivalent to the saves in terms of just ballparking a percentage.", "Bob Hau", "Correct, that\u2019s probably fair.", "Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research", "Gotcha, thanks so much, Bob, and congrats guys on the progress in the quarter.", "Bob Hau", "Thanks, Shawn.", "Operator", "Thank you. And next we\u2019ll go to the line of Amitabh Passi from UBS. Please go ahead.", "Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS ", "Hi, thank you. Tom, I wanted to try the portfolio question from a slightly different vantage point. If I look at Network solutions and I look at energy networks along with Consumer, these have been segments that have been quite challenging. You did talk about Network solutions improving. But I\u2019m curious, as you think about M&A is there opportunity to further bolster these segments or do you think this is largely a volume-related weakness, that as business and demand trends improve these segments do better? Or do you see M&A potential as well in telecom networks and energy networks?", "Tom Lynch", "Let me take each of those real quick individually. Energy I would say we\u2019ve always looked at and been interested in M&A in that business. Really it\u2019s been slow; it really follows the economy and we expect its growth to resume. It\u2019s been especially slow in Europe but it\u2019s a good business, it\u2019s a good cash generation business, a business that\u2019s right around the company average margin and that margin has been improving. Whenever we grow 3% to 4% we see a nice margin lift, so I\u2019d consider that a nice solid business that\u2019s steady contribution.", "Consumer, I don\u2019t see M&A in Consumer. I think that\u2019s really we have to win more sockets as we would say and more strategic sockets. I think we\u2019ve really upgraded some areas where we were very weak in that business which was operationally. We have what I consider a crackerjack operational team there now and we just have to persevere with the designs and get some design wins there, and that\u2019s revenue related. You\u2019re absolutely right \u2013 we need to grow more revenue there.", "And the third one was Networks in general, telecom, wireless. I don\u2019t see anything significant in M&A there because in our push to the network, I mean we made the move to take leadership in fiber when we acquired ADC. And while the revenue hasn\u2019t materialized like we thought, the insurance policy, the cost side, we\u2019ve taken a ton of costs out. So we feel that business, we\u2019re well positioned in our portion of the network. ", "We really do have the best fiber, the best connectivity product line across the world. We see it in the high win rate we have \u2013 that\u2019s a volume play. That\u2019s a very nice gross margin business that\u2019s higher than the company average gross margins so that\u2019s a leverage play and we\u2019re starting to see signs of this 4% growth range this year. So they\u2019re all kind of in a little bit different perspective but that\u2019s at a high level way to think about it.", "Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS ", "Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up, I was intrigued by your comment where you\u2019d said even if you\u2019re not a believer in fiber to the home. And I just wanted to get a sense from you, are you seeing a preference for wireless alternatives or next-gen copper alternatives which seems counter to some of the gigabit Ethernet movement that we\u2019re seeing the industry, or I thought we were seeing maybe the industry pivot back to where it\u2019s fiber to the home. So I would love to get your thoughts there.", "Tom Lynch", "It\u2019s mixed. I mean when we look at our business we know we need to be able to support multiple different network architectures, and they range from kind of HFC, the cable side going deeper, you know, the normal cable networks going deeper with more fiber \u2013 we\u2019re benefitting from that. Some carriers really believe in fiber deep and fiber to the home. I\u2019d say they\u2019re benefitting from that.", "DSL is really not sufficient anymore but it takes time to change it, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re hearing from one of the carriers, that they\u2019re going to get very aggressive in response to another new carrier/search company. Around the world it\u2019s different. There\u2019s parts of Europe where they\u2019re aggressively building fiber to the home, and there\u2019s other parts that are waiting for G.fast which is the super-fast VDSL, but that requires more fiber. There\u2019s Australia/New Zealand building fiber to the home and even with the changing government, while that\u2019s slowed down a bit it\u2019s probably going to be more selective with fiber to the home but fiber deep.", "But if you\u2019re going to deliver, if content providers \u2013 like they\u2019re negotiating now for dedicated bandwidth for the carriers, you\u2019re going to have to push fiber deeper into the network to get that because LTE does have some limitations. So I think it\u2019s kind of timing of investments but we are starting to see a little more positive signs, and we\u2019re optimistic that maybe this cycle on our end of the network \u2013 which I\u2019d call the bandwidth-rich portion of the network \u2013 is starting to come back. But we need to see that consistently before I\u2019m comfortable that it\u2019s actually here.", "Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS ", "Excellent, thank you.", "Tom Lynch", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you, and next we\u2019ll go to the line of Jim Suva from Ciri. Please go ahead. ", "Jim Suva \u2013 Citigroup ", "Thanks very much. A stickler clarification point and then my two questions: on the clarification, I assume or maybe let me know if I\u2019m right or wrong that the pending acquisition of SEACON is not in your sales and EPS outlook because it\u2019s still pending? Or maybe I\u2019m wrong with that. ", "And then along with that questioning, can you help us understand the margin profile of this businesses? It seems like it would be accretive to your margins but I\u2019m just not sure on that. And do you have to do any cost realignments with them? Like are they located physically where some of your plants are and you can integrate the two plants together? Are we looking at another round of restructuring or is it sound, everyone\u2019s quite happy with how you have it? ", "And then my second question is on a different topic about the consumer side, is you\u2019ve kind of been talking about trying to get some wins for quite some time organically. It seems like either it\u2019s not happening or you\u2019ve got the wins and they\u2019re going to come. But can you help us understand is your confidence there a lot higher or is there still just a lot of wood to chop or a lot more effort still to turn around the Consumer business which has been underperforming for multiple years?", "Bob Hau", "Yeah, Jim, it\u2019s Bob. On SEACON you are correct \u2013 we do not have an impact from the acquisition in our outlook. We expect that deal to close still later this year and it will close late enough in the year that it will have zero to negligible impact on the overall results for F2014. Obviously we expect it to close this fiscal year and so there\u2019ll be an impact in F2015.", "In terms of margin profile and our plans for restructuring sort of thing, I\u2019ll turn it back to Terrence to address that one.", "Terrence Curtin", "Thanks, Bob and Jim, it\u2019s Terrence. In relation to your question, yes, SEACON as Tom covered on the slide is about $115 million in revenue and has above 30% EBITDA. So from your viewpoint yes, it will be above company average margins of both the segment and the company in that regard.", "When we look at what they do, this is not a cost play. So when you look at restructuring there is no big restructuring or plant consolidations in relation to this acquisition. It\u2019s really around growth but certainly I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be some acquisition costs that Bob and Keith will call out to you just due to typical acquisition things but not restructuring.", "Tom Lynch", "And Jim, on the Consumer side I would say we\u2019re performing better in the newer parts of the market but it\u2019s not enough to move the needle yet. So let me elaborate a bit on that. The PC and feature phone business part of Consumer is still bigger than the tablet and smartphone business, and the PC and feature phone business which is where we still have a little better position in a market that\u2019s shrinking \u2013 but that\u2019s going to cross over sometime in the next year.", "But we\u2019re growing almost at the market in tablets and smartphones but it\u2019s just not enough to move the meter. So we have won some significant awards but it\u2019s still not big enough yet to grow the business. So I\u2019d say we\u2019re better in terms of our talent, our engineering, the products we\u2019re bringing out but it\u2019s going to still take us a while to move the performance up.", "Jim Suva \u2013 Citigroup ", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And next we\u2019ll go to the line of William Stein with SunTrust. Please go ahead.", "William Stein \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ", "Great, thank you for taking my question. I\u2019m wondering if you can talk about in the Automotive segment any effect from the EURO 6 implementation regarding particulate emissions that comes into force later this year? Is that having any effect on the business today?", "Tom Lynch", "We see it for sure and especially in the truck market, so in a couple areas. It\u2019s more content. We said earlier in the year we saw some pull forward as is typically what happens when there\u2019s a change in standard if a customer has the ability to pull some spending forward that costs them less they\u2019ll do that. So we saw a benefit from that. ", "What we\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised by is that it\u2019s still, the demand is still strong \u2013 stronger than what we would have expected at this time of year six months ago, which reflects I think more economics underlying that meaning things are picking up and people are investing. And the fundamental benefit of the emissions standard is it\u2019s more electronics and it\u2019s more content for us, so yes, we\u2019re starting to see the benefit of that.", "William Stein \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ", "Great. And then the follow-up is again on the subsea business, not wanting to beat a dead horse but this business has surprised you to the downside this year. You obviously have a better view into your business than we do so you have ways to look at it and forecast it that should be superior to ours, but what can we look at when we understand that your position is very strong in this market, you\u2019re doing very well in terms of winning mandates but the projects aren\u2019t coming into force. Is that an interest rate related thing, a credit related thing, a network bandwidth related issue? How can we think about the likelihood of more of these projects coming into force?", "Tom Lynch", "Well, there\u2019s multiple factors. The interesting thing, on one hand it\u2019s a finite number of projects but on the other hand each project could be affected by different things. So pre financial crisis till now, one of the things in a project that has to happen for a project to get funded, if it\u2019s a consortium or a group of entrepreneurs as we would call it, the bandwidth has to be presold. It used to be you could presell 60%, 70% and get the project funded. Now you have to sell 100% to 120%. It\u2019s taking longer for that.", "I think in general what you see, the carriers who were really drivers four or five years ago are less so today. It\u2019s a function of where they\u2019re putting their investment so that\u2019s the [landscape]. So it\u2019s been a variety of things. Where some of these big jobs are coming from \u2013 this last one, its two destination points are Hong Kong I think and France, and 30 branches in between, which the good news is it\u2019s a big job. The challenging news is that\u2019s an awful lot of approvals and permitting, so even if you have your money together you\u2019ve got to make sure you have all that. So that takes a while.", "So I\u2019d say there\u2019s a lot of things. When we kick the tires on modeling the bandwidth and making sure something hasn\u2019t happened I think we conclude that you\u2019ve got to build, the next build cycle is coming. Just to put it in perspective, the last cycle from trough to trough was twelve years. If you look at the trough of the last cycle to where we are right now, 2014, it was actually a twelve-year cycle; and trough to peak can typically be seven to eight years. ", "And in that twelve years you typically have three or four what I\u2019d call tough years and three or four good years and three or four great years, and over the cycle it\u2019s a good business that really is a nice contributor to the company, well above cost of capital. We believe that this 2014 is that next real trough, and it\u2019s higher than the last trough because there\u2019s just more building and we have this oil & gas adjacency that we didn\u2019t have early in the last cycle. So it\u2019s been a little tough to forecast for us for sure.", "I think the last point I\u2019d make about putting it in perspective, if you look at last year the business contributed $0.06 to $0.07 a share, roughly 2% of our total earnings per share. This year it\u2019s going to be a negative 1% earnings per share because of F3Q. So I think it\u2019s down. The volatility is still high but the impact is low, and if things start to ramp up again we should see steady contributions. ", "If the AAE1 deal had not signed I\u2019d be a lot more nervous. That\u2019s a big deal. That\u2019ll get us going and then what we\u2019ve also seen in the up-cycles, it\u2019s not a perfect predictor but when a big job like this goes it tends to mobilize the other ones because there is a limited amount of [shipped] capacity. So this was, getting this job\u2026 We\u2019ve got to go through the valley in F3Q in this business but getting this job is a big, big step up; and then we\u2019ve got to get a couple other, two of these to come into force and we work hard to help our customers do that.", "William Stein \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ", "That\u2019s helpful, thanks Tom.", "Tom Lynch", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Steven Fox from Cross Research. Please go ahead.", "Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research", "Thanks, good morning. Just a couple quick questions, first on the Auto side: Tom, you mentioned some market share gains. I was wondering if you could elaborate on that as well as some more aggressive investments in China for Auto and whether that\u2019s also driving market share gains? And then secondly with regard to the acquisition, I was just curious if you could just discuss a little bit how well positioned or not well positioned they are from a distribution standpoint and whether there could be some sales synergies there like you\u2019ve seen with Deutsche. Thanks.", "Tom Lynch", "On the Auto side as you know we are strong in every region. If you go back in time four or five years really our weakest region was the US, and the downturn was extremely painful but it gave us the opportunity because in this part of the value chain we\u2019re the leader. We invested in the US when it was down. We did things like adjust our cost of sales cost structure, but we invested in engineering and we went after programs. And our estimation is we\u2019ve moved our US share up about four points over that time, so that was positive.", "In China we provide a very broad range of services and products to our customers. We\u2019ve been expanding our engineering there. Our entire China Automotive team is local. It\u2019s a very seasoned, experienced team. We are expanding our capacity there not only because the market is expanding but because we\u2019re doing more and more there for that market. If you go back in time it was a lot of things imported into the market and we\u2019re reducing that quickly, and that\u2019s part of the footprint adjustment we were doing in Western Europe during the downturn. ", "So those two things plus we continue to add engineers across the world in Automotive. It\u2019s a business that\u2019s very\u2026 You know, it\u2019s a lot of projects that you have to work on with the customer and when we\u2019re so strong in all these customers and we keep pouring engineers in, that\u2019s how we\u2019re able to build the 200 million sensor business from nothing when we weren\u2019t in the sensor business. So it is our sweet spot and we keep investing in it aggressively. Terrence, do you want to comment on SEACON again?", "Terrence Curtin", "Yes, sure. When you look at SEACON, and to your question, Steve, in relationship to channel and distribution \u2013 when you look at this market it is a much more direct market. So where we\u2019re going to sell into and where we sell into today with our current portfolio as well as where SEACON sells into, you\u2019re selling into the manufacturers of the drilling systems, certainly the ROV systems, all the instruments and lights as well as the equipment that goes on the ocean floor. So when you look at it, it\u2019s a much more direct relationship than channel serve.", "I think what\u2019s very nice about both our go-to-market position as well as SEACON\u2019s, they have bases in Norway, UK, US, Mexico as well as they also have a nice field service support around the world that supports their product too with people working in the oil & gas industry. So it is a much more direct model than what we saw in Deutsche where we were able to leverage our channel scale. So it\u2019s much more direct than a channel play.", "Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research", "Great, thanks very much. I appreciate the color.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our last question goes to the line of Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Sheri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Hi, this is (Inaudible) here calling on behalf of Sherri Scribner. Tom, I just had a question for you, actually. In your opening comments you mentioned a majority of the markets are exhibiting solid growth trends. I just wanted to understand what demand trends you\u2019re seeing or do you still see customers as being cautious? Are you seeing any reductions in customer forecasts? Thanks.", "Tom Lynch", "Thank you. Yeah, let me go through that. So clearly Auto and Industrial Transportation continue to grow, there\u2019s robust growth there. We really haven\u2019t seen that change much. As I mentioned we\u2019ll see that the second half growth year-over-year in those markets will be less than the first half growth \u2013 some of that\u2019s seasonal, some of that is it\u2019s just been hotter than normal in the first half. Industrial equipment is growing with 8% quarter growth, that\u2019s another third or fourth. ", "So that\u2019s a sign and you see it in a lot of the industrials reporting that capital spending is starting to break loose. We see that, that seems to be a pretty steady sign right now. I\u2019m not seeing any warning signs that that would change. Commercial aerospace, a lot of new planes being built, the whole fleet being rebuilt and that\u2019s another area where we gain share and our content is up significantly, so we see that. And then the appliance business.", "So new home sales in the US and appliance picking up in Asia, particularly China which is a good sign because that\u2019s consumer spending in China. And by the way, I talked about our China business being up 34% in Automotive. It was up 20% plus overall with four of five of our markets up double digits. So it\u2019s fairly broad based.", "What\u2019s not growing? I\u2019d say the Data Comm market is not really growing right now and you can see that in other folks who provide that equipment \u2013 it\u2019s certainly not growing for us. Consumer is growing but I talked about the trends, that we\u2019re not fully participating in the trends. And of course the one that\u2019s challenging right now is Sub Comm but that\u2019s just timing in our view and we have a good position there.", "So if I compare it to last quarter, if I compare it to this time last year it definitely feels more robust, broader based. If you look at the number of countries that we ship to around the world there\u2019s more where we have higher sales growth this quarter than we did last quarter and last year \u2013 all good signs. I\u2019d say nobody\u2019s celebrating. We\u2019re still very mindful that the last five years have been unpredictable if anything so we keep running the business accordingly.", "Sheri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay great, thanks, that was helpful. I just also wanted to just follow up on that, just to get an idea on the long-term growth target if you maintain what you have previously provided \u2013 for example, 6% to 8% in Transportation and 4% to 7% in Network, 4% to 6% in Industrial and 3% to 5% in Consumer. Do you still maintain that or do you see a change in that long-term target?", "Tom Lynch", "That\u2019s still how we see the long term.", "", "Sheri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay great, thank you.", "Tom Lynch", "You\u2019re welcome. Okay, well thank you everybody. I appreciate you listening. Again, I think this was a real good quarter for us with progress on a number of fronts. I look forward to talking to you soon.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference.

Welcome to the TE Connectivity Fiscal Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sujal Shah. Please go ahead.", "Sujal Shah", "", "Good morning. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's third quarter fiscal 2014 results. With me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch and Chief Financial Officer, Bob Hau.", "During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today\u2019s press release. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning. We ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that addresses the use of these items.", "The press release and related tables along with the slide presentation can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.te.com. Finally, for participants on the Q&A portion of today's call, I would like to remind everyone to limit themselves to one follow-up question to make sure we are able to cover all questions during the allotted time.", "Now, let me turn the call over to Tom for some opening comments.", "Tom Lynch", "", "Thanks, Sujal. Good morning, everyone. I am very pleased with the results we delivered in the quarter. Sales were up 4%, despite a very weak subsea communications market. Adjusted operating margins exceeded 15%, adjusted earnings per share growth was 14% year-over-year at the high-end of our guidance range and a new record for the company. We also continued to generate strong cash flow with over $500 million of free cash flow in the third quarter.", "Here are the key takeaways from today's call. Most of our key end markets have positive trends, especially in the transportation and industrial segments. The subsea market has continued to be weak, but we believe the market has bottomed and I will share some additional good news on this market with you in a minute.", "We continued to generate strong performances in businesses that serve our harsh environment applications, which account for approximately 70% of our revenue. As I mentioned earlier, we continued to deliver solid financial performance with improved operating leverage and strong cash flow. The strong cash flow enables us to return significant cash to shareholders and strengthen the company through acquisitions like those recently announced.", "The last point is that we are reaffirming our full-year guidance that we gave 90 days ago, despite a weaker SubCom business in Q3 and Q4.", "Now, I will comment on these key takeaways in a more detail. On the market trend side, we do continue to see positive trends in the majority of markets we serve, and the combination of these trends and strong execution will result in strong financial performance this year.", "During the quarter, strength in the transportation market continued and most industrial markets continued their steady improvement. Transportation solutions grew 8% organically, with sales and order growth in all major regions. Our Industrial Solutions segment grew 4% organically and our Appliances business in the Consumer Solutions segment grew by 9% organically.", "Revenue in our Telecom and Enterprise businesses were largely in line with our expectations. Revenue in the Consumer Devices and SubCom businesses were slightly below expectations in the quarter.", "On a regional basis, excluding SubCom, sales grew in North America, Asia and EMEA, driven by particular strength in the U.S., China and Germany.", "We continue to execute very strongly in businesses that focus on harsh environment applications. As you know several years ago, we launched our strategy to increase the company's focus in the harsh environment applications. We have been increasing organic investment and have focused our acquisitions in these areas.", "The strategy is paying off, as over 70% of our businesses are in these segments generating mid-to-high single-digit organic growth and above our company average margins. These solutions are highly engineered, designed in partnership with our customers and are characterized by relatively longer product cycles and higher margins.", "This capability is not easily replicated and we believe that TE's ability to provide this broad range of solutions for harsh environments will remain a strong differentiator and growth driver as we move forward.", "Below the top-line, our efforts on TEOA continued to drive productivity gains and operating leverage. Our gross margins have improved to the 33% to 34% range and we are now consistently generating 15% adjusted operating margins on an annual revenue run rate below $14 billion.", "We also continue to generate strong cash flow with over $1 billion of free cash flow through the first nine months of the year, supporting our capital program and acquisition strategy.", "Subsequent to the quarter, we closed the acquisition of the SEACON Group, which expands our business in a very attractive oil and gas market. In June, we announced the acquisition of Measurement Specialties, which establishes us as a leading supplier of sensors and connectors at nearly 40 billion to our addressable market and further increases our content in harsh applications.", "Once the transaction is complete, TE will have a broad portfolio of sensors to go along with our leading portfolio of connectors. Our existing scale coupled with Measurement Specialties' product range will enable the combined companies to accelerate sensor growth as we reach many more customers.", "Now let's turn to Slide 3. Revenues in the third quarter were in line with expectations and adjusted EPS of $1.00 dollar was at the high end of our guidance range and a quarterly record for the company. Free cash flow was strong at $530 million and we returned $169 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases.", "For the full-year, as I mentioned, we are reiterating the mid-point of our revenue and EPS guidance. Expected revenue of $13.95 billion represents 5% growth versus the prior year and adjusted EPS of $3.78 represents 17% growth versus our prior year performance, a very strong year for TE.", "We closed the SEACON acquisition just after the quarter and the Measurement Specialties acquisition is on track to close this calendar year.", "I will now provide some detail by business within each segment in the next four slides. Unless I indicate otherwise all changes are on an organic basis, which excludes the effect of currencies, acquisitions and divestitures.", "Please turn Slide 4. Transportation Solutions had another great quarter with sales of $1.585 billion, up 8% over the prior year and with orders growth of 7%.", "Sales and orders grew across all regions and global auto demand continues to be solid with vehicle production of about $21.4 million units. The end market continues to be healthy and TE is performing well.", "We delivered adjusted operating margins of 21% due to volume growth, product mix and productivity improvements driven by our TEOA program. Looking forward, we expect another strong quarter in Q4, with sales up high single digits and operating margin expansion versus the prior year.", "Please turn to Page 5. Market demand in the Industrial Solutions segment was in line with our expectations in the third quarter. Revenues were up 4% and orders were up 2% versus the prior year. The majority of the industrial markets we serve continued to gradually improve.", "Industrial equipment revenues were up 3%, driven primarily by double-digit growth in China. Our Aerospace, Defense, Oil and Gas business was up 8%, due to continued strength in commercial aviation and the oil and gas units.", "Our energy business was up slightly in the quarter, with growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions offset by weakness in Europe. Adjusted operating margins were up 160 basis points versus the prior year as a result of increased volumes and productivity increases and I'm especially pleased with our margin improvement in this segment.", "Looking forward, we expect another good quarter in Q4, with sales up mid-single digits organically and approximately 10% on an actual basis, including the SEACON acquisition. ", "Please turn to Page 6. Sales in the network segment were down 8% versus the prior year, due principally to continued project delays in our SubCom business. Excluding SubCom sales were down 2% organically. SubCom weakness drove the decline in Network Solutions' operating margin in the quarter. Just to put it in perspective, our SubCom revenues were down 50% versus last year's Q3.", "Telecom and Enterprise businesses were down slightly year-over-year, but in line with our expectations. Strength in fiber-optic and wireless deployments is being offset by declines in copper network investments and our DataCom business was down 5% due to continued market related weakness.", "In our SubCom business, I am happy to report, we recently received down payments on two major projects. The AAE1 project, which connects Asia, Africa and Europe, was announced in April and we received the down payment on that. Then earlier this week, we announced the Hibernia project, which will connect New York and London. That's the first significant cross-Atlantic [building] building some time which is very good news. We also received the down payment there. Both of these projects will start in late Q4, which we believe marks the beginning of the upturn in this cycle. On a combined basis, these projects are worth approximately at 700 million plus over the next two to three years.", "In Q4, we expect network revenues to be flat, excluding SubCom. While we will start to build very early stages of the build, we are not going to get too much impact from these projects until next year.", "Please turn to Slide 7. Revenue in our Consumer Solutions business was roughly flat versus the prior year and this continues to be kind of a tale of two cities. We had another strong quarter in the Appliance business, where we have our global leadership position in operating margins run above our company average. Sales in this business were up 9% year-over-year, due to strengthening demand in the Americas and Asia.", "This growth was offset by lower customer demand for mobile phone components and continued weakness. Although looks like a PC business is starting to stabilize in the consumer devices business. Adjusted operating margins in this segment expanded 120 basis points year-over-year, due to the strong performance in the appliance business.", "In Q4, we expect revenues to be down slightly versus the prior year, due to continued weakness in the consumer devices portion of the business we do expect another solid growth quarter in our appliance business.", "I will turn it over to, Bob, to cover the financials in more detail.", "Bob Hau", "Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Let me discuss earnings which start on Slide 8. Adjusted operating income was $550 million, up 8% versus the prior year. GAAP operating income was $535 million and included $14 million of restructuring and other charges most of which was in the consumer segment and $1 million of acquisition related charges in the quarter.", "We anticipate full year restructuring charges of approximately $65 million for the full year. Adjusted operating margin was 15.4%, up 60 basis points from Q3 last year. The improvement versus the prior year is driven by improved manufacturing and productivity across all of our segments and volume leverage in the transportation and industrial segments. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.00 and GAAP earnings per share were $0.97 for the quarter. GAAP EPS included $0.03 of restructuring and other charges.", "Turning to Slide 9, our gross margin in the quarter was 33.6%. This is an 80-basis point increase versus the prior year, due to increased productivity from our TEOA or lean programs. The cost savings from restructuring and metals, and general volume increases offset by the impact of lower SubCom sales.", "Our total operating expenses were $654 million in the quarter, which was up 5% versus the prior year. The increased resulted primarily from increased investments in sales and marketing to support growth initiatives. On the right side of the slide, you will see net interest expense was $26 million in the quarter and I expect about $26 million of expense again in the fourth quarter.", "Adjusted other income was primarily relate to our tax sharing agreement was $9 million. In the fourth quarter, I expect other income of about $8 million. The adjusted effective tax rate was 21.8%, slightly better than expectations as we saw large portion of our income earned in lower tax jurisdictions. I now expect the full-year effective tax rate of approximately 23%. ", "Turning to Slide 10, I will discuss our balance sheet and free cash flow. Cash from continuing operations was $501 million and our free cash flow in Q3 was $530 million. Net capital spending during the quarter was $171 million or 4.8% of sales. I expect the capital spending rate to be approximately 4.5% of sales for the full-year.", "In addition, we made a $200 million tax payments related to a pre-separation tax audit during the quarter. Our working capital was in line with our expectations, with receivable days outstanding at 63 days. Inventory days on hand were 68 days and payable days outstanding were 54.", "Now, let me discussed the sources and uses of cash outside of free cash flow shown on the right side of the slide. Began the quarter at $1.4 billion of cash and increased to $1.6 billion in advance with the acquisition of SEACON, which closed subsequent to the end of the quarter.", "During the quarter, we returned the totaled of $169 million to shareholders. We paid dividends of $119 million and we repurchased about 1 million shares for $50 million. Outstanding debt remained at $3 billion at the quarter of the quarter.", "Now, I will turn it back to Tom.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks Bob. Please turn to Slide 11, and I'll cover our outlook. We expect another strong quarter in Q4, with revenue of $3.56 billion to $3.66 billion, which will be up 47% year-over-year and we expect adjusted EPS of $0.98 to $1.02, an increase of 5% to 10% over year. Again, that's covering up a very weak year-over-year performance in the SubCom business.", "We do expect continued strength in transportation and industrial. For the full-year, we expect revenue of $13.9 to $14 billion, up 5% versus the prior year. We expect adjusted earnings per share of 376 the 380 and that's an increase of 16% to 18%. As I mentioned earlier, very, very strong year for the company.", "We are going to open it up for questions. Then I will make some closing comments, when we are done the Q&A.", "Operator, if you could open the line for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani. Please go ahead.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks a lot. Good morning, guys. Two questions for me. One, I guess, Tom, on the networking side, the Subsea business, given the wins you had recently, I sort of come up with a $120 million, $130 million run rate that is feasible in FY'15 on a quarterly basis.", "I'm curious if that's a reasonable expectation to have. Then, importantly, how do you think leverage plays out on the upside in the undersea business? Is this something that can sustain 50%, 60% conversion margins as you start to see some revenue growth?", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks, Amit. As you know we will give guidance for the full-year next year, so I am not really going to get into any details, but I'm very encouraged. Finally these projects which we had won and been awarded are going to come into force and when we get the down payment, that's really the proof point.", "I think in the beginning, it will start slow, right, as we are ramping. It will take a couple of quarters to really get at peak efficiency, but the way I would think about it at this point is it's been a pretty significant headwind for the last couple years and it should become a tailwind next year.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "How do we think of conversion margins, I guess, on that business, Tom, as you start to get incremental sales?", "Tom Lynch", "Well, again, I don't want to get too specific on that, but it will be reasonable margin conversion. The first job, as you build, as you add jobs you\u2019re your capacity, the conversion margins increase, so we are still going to be not running at capacity with the first job over the second job.", "If you look at our history, it's when you have three or four jobs running. That's when you really see the margins starts to ramp up, but it should be a nice positive next year.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Got it. Then just secondly on the cash flow usage dynamics, the buyback pays at $60 million this quarter was a lot below the historical trends you have done for the last several years now, I am assuming you guys are busy, because of Measurement Specialties this quarter, so maybe that negated it.", "Maybe just talk about why was that pace slower. Is that something you should expect to see as you go forward or should we expect that to uptick? Then maybe just touch on the $200 million payment you guys had to make for the tax separation.", "Bob Hau", "Yes. It's Bob. I guess both pieces. One, on the share repurchase, we did repurchase about 1 million shares in the current quarter for about $50 million. That is below what we have been running over the last several quarters and it is directly attributed to the M&A activity with measurement in particular where we had as you might suspect material non-public information, so we were blacked out of the market for essentially the vast majority of the quarter. That limited that capability.", "As we indicated when we announced the Measurement Specialties' acquisition, out into the future, we don't anticipate that deal impact our go-forward plans in terms of return of capital to shareholders, maintaining the two-thirds back to shareholders over time.", "In terms of the $200 million pre-separation tax payment, that was done in conjunction with the other parties Covidien is Tyco International to pay in advance the 2005-2007 tax audit that is winding up its near completion. We are waiting for the final paperwork from the IRS, so we need that payment in the third quarter to essentially stop the interest calculation on that liability.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets", "Very helpful. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks, Amit.", "Bob Hau", "Thank you, Amit.", "Tom Lynch", "Next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Amitabh Passi. Please go ahead.", "Amitabh Passi - UBS", "Hi. Thank you. I had a question if you could help us in terms of thinking about normalized margins as we look further to 2015, so kind of piggybacking on the last question. Automotive or transportation, you are kind of running just above 21%. My question was, is there meaningful room to expand that?", "The bigger question is, network solutions, how do we think about normalized margins? Can that segment get back to at least the high single digits to lower double digits over the next four to six quarters?", "Tom Lynch", "Sure. Thanks, Amitabh. The normalized margin, as you know, we are pleased to be at this 15% at under $14 billion run rate. I think, automotive - I think this is what I have said the last couple quarters, but plus 20% margin win with kind of normalized vehicle growth, which has been 2.5% to 3% range.", "I feel confident that we will continue to generate these kinds of margins. This year we are getting a little extra benefit from the great, the really positive mix in heavy trucks both, the Deutsche acquisition and legacy TE business there, so that has given us a push. Our productivity is strong in that business, so I feel good where the margins are and the ability to sustain them.", "I do expect that we will improve the Network Solutions margins. SubCom is a pretty significant negative margin in the second half and as we get these two jobs rolling that will start to turn in our, what we call the B&S unit, which is Telecom, Wireless and Enterprise, that's running in double-digit margins now. This year it will be the second year in a row that we have added 100 basis points in margin improvement there, so I do expect the Network Solutions to move back toward double-digit margins over the next year to 18 months, depending on the end demand, but we sized for that to take advantage of reasonable growth.", "Amitabh Passi - UBS", "Tom, just as a follow-up on the network solutions, particularly Telecom Networks and Enterprise Networks, these segments are still kind of flat on a year-over-year basis. Can you give us a sense of what you are seeing in the demand environment, perhaps by geography and how we should be thinking about growth in 2015?", "Tom Lynch", "Again, we are not giving any guidance yet, but this quarter we will give you specificity around the big businesses. What we are seen around the world is mix, that the project business. In this past quarter, European projects were strong in Telecom, weak in Energy.", "U.S. was a little soft. I think, there is so much going on right now at the macro level in the U.S. telecom-related business that's delayed a few things, but we believe the fundamentals are there to support solid growth in the U.S. going forward.", "Australia, that important job is building, despite the political uncertainty, so there is and China, as we have mentioned, we have been retreating a little bit from the China market, because a good portion of that market just isn't very attractive.", "It's kind of a mixed bag. The good news is that we have a really win rate on the fiber awards, and the fiber portion of the network for the second year in a row is growing in solid double-digit. Copper is shrinking, but the good news is the copper base is getting smaller and smaller, so we think the math is the turn pretty soon where that double-digit fiber growth and more and more jobs out there is going to start to deliver this into kind of a low to mid single-digit business and there was pretty good operating leverage in the telecom portion of that business, because it's a nice margin business because of highly engineered products there.", "Amitabh Passi - UBS", "Okay. Thank you.", "Tom Lynch", "Thank you, Amitabh. Next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from a line of Wamsi Mohan. Please go ahead.", "Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Bob, can you bridge the [90]-basis point decline in transportation margins on a quarter-on-quarter basis? Obviously, it is still very strong versus a year ago, but any color you can share in terms of how it played out between price volume mix or was operating margin more driven by increased investments? If so, where those investments were focused? I have a follow-up.", "Bob Hau", "Essentially, from a sequential quarter-over-quarter, there are probably two significant drivers. The first one being the main one and it's a bit of mix of the automotive versus the industrial commercial vehicle piece, the heavy trucks. We're overweighed in the second quarter on the commercial vehicle business which has a higher operating margin.", "Secondly, we are making investments in the combined transportation business and that is ramping up over time, so there is a bit more in terms of OpEx in the third quarter relative to the second quarter of this year.", "Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks. Tom, can you talk a little bit about that commercial transport strength and how much longer it can persist? I think a couple quarters ago, you had noted there were pre-buys and expected that market to sort of soften, sounds like there were puts and takes by different regions, but you are still tracking pretty strongly, so just wondering is there something that is driving more persistent strength in that business over the next few quarters as well?", "To touch on Consumer Devices really quick, that was weaker. Sounds like even next quarter you are not really expecting that to recover. There are some significant consumer product ramps that are happening as we speak, so are you not levered to that? How do you feel about your position in that market longer term? Thanks.", "Tom Lynch", "Sure. The commercial business for the next quarter, it looks, and we will talk again next quarter about what we see in '15. It has been a little bit stronger than we had expected throughout the year. I think you are seeing the pent-up demand in heavy trucks in the U.S. and China and a little bit in Europe, just starting.", "I think, there's still a fair amount of momentum in the market, because the new China emissions standards don't cut over really until January, so there's a pre-buy, but most of is going to be the post-buy. As we are across all of our businesses, the China businesses is strong again, so if that continues there's strong activity which will require continued investment in heavy trucks and we will see the shift away from the local that we are beginning to see from the local truck manufacturers, so there are more multi-nationals because of the emissions standard.", "I don't expect it to continue with this rate. Buried within that is a pretty weak Mining, Construction and Agricultural business. It's growing at a much lower rate, the Mining business as you know has been very weak for the last six months for heavy equipment, so I would expect heavy truck demand to start slow down. Then the heavy equipment demand to start to pick up and this continue to be a very solid growth business for us.", "Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, Tom. On Consumer Devices?", "Tom Lynch", "Consumer, we have a thin base. That's our issue, of if a customer or two has a shift, we pay. We can get a nice windfall or we suffer and we are just thinly based in the business. We continue to be selective. I think the team is doing a good job, but that is just not a strong business for us. As I think I have indicated. It's going to take a couple of years really to some wind in our back.", "Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, Tom.", "Tom Lynch", "Thank you, Wamsi. The next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood. Please go ahead.", "Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc.", "Hi. Thank you. Thanks for the color on the $200 million tax payment. How does this compare to that [scenario] in your reserves regarding the intercompany interest exclusion and would there be any major variance versus what you have reserved in the settlement based on - it seems like you are nearing that closure.", "Tom Lynch", "Yes. The $200 million was essentially settling or is an anticipation of settling the '05-'07 audit period excluding intercompany debt. Once we get the final settlement, which we anticipate now in the fourth quarter, essentially we will have settled all pre-separation matters with the exception of the intercompany debt.", "As you know that is currently going through the tax courts. We anticipate that to take some period of time. We are always open to settlement conversations, but right now that looks like it's going to wind through the tax courts which will take a couple of years.", "When we first separated and started talking about the tax liability for the company pre-separation tax liability, we essentially indicated $600 million to $700 million of cash payments would be anticipated over an extended period of time.", "With this most recent payment, we have essentially got about $450 million of that behind us, so going forward once we settled that intercompany debt, we think there is another $200 million of cash will have to be paid out.", "Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc.", "Great. With, Measurement Specialties, since the announcement, there has been some news about a factory strike in China and shareholder lawsuits fairness, which I think that gets filed typically after every public company is taken out, but are these issues settled and would they have any impact on the timing of closing?", "Tom Lynch", "No. They are not going to have any impact. Again, we haven't closed yet, so I won't imagine they are managing through the labor issue in China, which also is not unusual in these kind of deals too. It's they anticipated it, we anticipated and the shareholder suit is it happens every time I think.", "Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Tom Lynch", "\u2026any real issues.", "Sujal Shah", "", "All right. Thank you, Mike. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "Your next comes from the line of Matt Sheerin. Please go ahead.", "Matt Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.", "Yes. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted a follow-up on your comments regarding the profitability in Network Solutions. Tom excess Subsea or SubCom business, sounds like you were saying the other three segments are at high-single digit to low double-digit operating profit. I just wanted to double check that, particularly on DataCom, with profitability there.", "It's unsure. Although, obviously, year-over-year comps are getting easier there, still doesn't look like you are optimistic about that market, so what's your near and long-term strategy there in terms of profitability? Whether or not you are going to take another look at restructuring that business or taking another approach?", "Tom Lynch", "I would break the Networks, really, and it's kind of we have it in three major pieces, so there's the Telecom, Wireless and Enterprise businesses that are submarkets, but we have them run by one team. That's the business I answered to the earlier question on that has operating margins in low double digits today, where we have strong market positions, where we have a great fiber product line and we are really seeing the shift to fiber continue to increase. I think that's well positioned, as the market picks up, as that mix of fiber and copper continues to move in our favor to have operating leverage on the margin.", "SubCom, I talked about that's negative margin, but historically it will run in the double-digit range and DataCom is still the weakest margin of the three in the single digits. A lot of that is because we are investing pretty significantly in the next generation platforms, and we have very little revenue there, so I feel good about those high-speed platforms, but there is no question.", "We are winning awards, but the markets are adopting slowly. As you know in that whole space right now, there is an awful lot of change going on in the whole, what I would call the communication equipment infrastructure side.", "Again, we don't have a real strong position there. I think there is an opportunity for us, we are investing for the company relatively modest amount - significant in that business, but pretty modest amount of investment to make sure we have a strong high-speed play.", "Matt Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.", "Okay. Thanks. Then just wanted to follow-up regarding the SEACON acquisition, could you tell us what the revenue contribution approximately would be this quarter? Is it roughly $30 million or so?", "Bob Hau", "Yes. That's exactly right. There is about $30 million, $35 million of revenue and that is encompassed in our guidance for fourth quarter.", "Matt Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Sujal Shah", "", "Thanks, Matt. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva. Please go ahead.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup", "Thank you and congratulations to you and your team. I have two questions. The first is, when we consider the transportation segment, I believe long-term you are saying that growth rate should kind of be 6% to 8%.", "Now that we are seeing that Europe is improving, which has very high content per cars and also there is newer hybrid technology catching on, and you just posted organic growth rate of 8%. Is there anything in there that makes it especially on the high end or are we actually shifting towards - long-term we could be at the upper end of that normal range of 6% to 8% or even higher given the hybrid technology coming on?", "Then the second question is, I guess, for Bob, the CFO, on restructuring with these acquisitions that are being folded in. Outlook on restructuring charges that I believe you have been kind of actively focused on reducing your restructuring. I did not know if that was on an apples-to-apples basis or all of a sudden now with acquisitions we need to model in some additional integration, acquisition restructuring charges?", "Tom Lynch", "Thank you, Jim. Regarding the automotive growth rate, you are right. We do see it at 6% to 8% and we took that up a little over a year ago. We used to see it as 5% to 7%, a couple factors in there. More, I would say content-driven for sure. I think it will - most so called experts would see that the typical production growth is going to be in the 3% to 4% range, so solid content.", "HEV, hybrid electric vehicles, definitely the bigger that gets the bigger that is for all of our supplying into the market, because that's more content. Then, of course, the Measurement acquisition is going to help our content.", "As we get their products and we start selling them in to the automotive market, which they're not today, they have a nice business in the industrial transportation, but the really big opportunity is automotive and we would expect. We are not changing. You know, it's too early to change the range, because there are so many factors that go in to that. Certainly, I would say there is a lot more pointing to the higher part of the range than the lower part of the range at this point.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup", "Great. Then on restructuring charges?", "Bob Hau", "Yes, Jim. In terms of restructuring, both acquisitions that we have got going on right now SEACON just recently closed and Measurement that will close by the end of the calendar year, either one of them have significant restructuring associated with them, so I don't anticipate big movement above what we have indicated as kind of more normal level of restructuring on an annual basis about $50 million to $75 million, I think, will be in line with that going forward.", "Of course, as we look at our acquisitions that may change, but we will indicate that when that changes.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup", "That's great news across the board. Thanks and congratulations to you and your team there.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks, Jim.", "Sujal Shah", "", "Thank you. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner. Please go ahead.", "Kirti Shetty - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Hi, this is Kirti Shetty call on behalf of Sherri Scribner. I actually just had one question one the operating margins. Given your long-term target of 15%, and looking at where you have reached this quarter was around 15.4%, how should we think about the target? Do you still maintain it at 15% or how should we be visioning your op margins going forward?", "Tom Lynch", "I think the best way to think about it is, as we laid out our operating model, we would expect the business in an economy that has grown 3% to 4% to grow by 5% to 7%organically and that operating model should generate in a kind of a normal copper environment, no big swings in exchange rate 20% to 25% flow through.", "All other things being equal, we would expect that to lift our margins 30 basis points to 50 basis points.", "Kirti Shetty - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay.", "Tom Lynch", "We are not setting a new target like we did before, but I think we have good operating leverage in the company now. Of course, our big thing is to continue to drive solid consistent double-digit EPS growth and cash flow that continues to approximate net income. As we are on track this year for another year of free cash flow above 10% of our revenue.", "Kirti Shetty - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay. Got it. Just to look at the different segments, I was just wondering, is there any kind of seasonality that we can look into? For example the transportation and especially with networking and given the SEACON weakness and things like that?", "Tom Lynch", "Yes. It's interesting. I think, seasonality, it still exists, but it's because the markets are so global now, the seasonality pronounced as it used to be. Having said that, which will typically see like we are seeing now in our fourth quarter Automotive, sequentially, will go down because its heavy vacation in August and that's when the biggest model changeover occurs in August.", "Typically, broadband or the non-SubCom DataCom portion of Networks, this will be a stronger quarter because of the weather. You know it's pretty much good weather everywhere typically and that's a business that's very affected by that's, because it's outside primarily.", "Then, we are not in a big consumer. We don't have a big consumer-electronics business, but that cycle would typically be strong right now because of getting ready for the holiday season. I think over time these peaks and valleys of seasonality are starting to get smoothed out of it.", "Kirti Shetty - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay. Got it. Thanks. Then one last, just wanted to confirm. You said the guidance factors and the SEACON acquisition of 30 million to 35. Was that million?", "Bob Hau", "That's correct. In terms of revenue, right?", "Kirti Shetty - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Yes. Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Tom Lynch", "Thank you.", "Sujal Shah", "", "All right. Thank you. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of William Stein. Please go ahead.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Great. Thanks for taking the question. First, I'm wondering if you can comment on PCs. I think you noted that as weak in the quarter, but we started to see that turned at a lot of companies in particular, Intel, so I am wondering if you can give some color there.", "Tom Lynch", "I mean, it looks like that business might be finally leveling off. We still have a pretty nice position in the PC business. In the grand scheme of things of the company, it's not that big, so up or down.", "We like it being up better than down so that's encouraging, but our real focus there is to build a better position in smartphones and tablets. You know, we are better than we were a couple years ago, but we are still not where we need to be.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Great. Then in the wireless infrastructure end market, I apologize if you already mentioned this, but I must have missed it. This is an area where people have been paying a lot of attention to relative to try to China Mobile build and we saw one very problematic data point last night. I wonder what you are seeing in that market.", "Tom Lynch", "Yes. I mean, again, we have a pretty [nichie] wireless infrastructure business, so in our DataCom business, that business is going well. I would say more, because we have a great product line that goes on the tower, so as much the sheer benefit is market.", "Then in our the Telecom business, we have a digital antenna system and that business is pretty vibrant right now in the U.S. as its way of expanding coverage and capacity, especially around large venues like stadiums, so we are seeing that pick up. Again, in the grand scheme of wireless, we are kind of a niche player. I don't think it would be indicative of a trend one way or another.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "That's helpful, Tom. Just one other one I can squeeze it in. On the M&A pipeline, you guys have been pretty clear that you are focused on sensors. Now, with Measurement Specialties, what should we think about as the focus going forward? Is the company ready and able to target additional acquisitions? How should we think about that, please?", "Tom Lynch", "Sure. I would say, I would start with were folks on harsh environment, so continuing to build that part of our business. If you go back a few years it was about 60% of our business.", "With these two new acquisitions, it's moving close to 75% of our business as we have also sold out of things like Magnetics and Touch, so we are continuing to reposition the company. I think that's working well for us.", "We do have a very, let's say, robust pipeline as you know it usually takes longer rather than shorter to bring the ones that you really like, and if you can bring them in at all, so we do have the desire and the capability to do more and we are very selective.", "We had two hit quickly here. It just happened to be that's the way the timing worked out. Two years before that and, you know, it's two plus years before that, so there is no real consistent timing I would say.", "What I like about where we sit today is, we are building a good reputation for how to do these and I think we are an attractive acquirer to a company and I know the companies that are coming in feel really good about coming in to TE and we are also selective, really selective.", "I think, we want to continue both, organically and inorganically, build that harsh because that's our sweet spot. That's what we do best and we think we can do it better than anybody.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Thanks, Tom. That's helpful. Appreciate it.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks, Will.", "Sujal Shah", "", "Thank you. Could we have the next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney. Please go ahead.", "Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks very much for taking the questions. Bob, I am hoping you can help me bridge the implied operating margin guidance for 4Q versus 4Q of 2013. It seems by my math that op margins are relatively flat year-over-year.", "I think you guys should be getting some restructuring and commodity benefits that are flowing through on a year-over-year basis, but maybe you could just help me understand and quantify what some of the dollar headwinds are, be it, Subsea being lower profitability, maybe mix or some of these other factors you already discussed, like the new investments.", "Bob Hau", "Yes. Thanks, Mark. Yes. We are about flat. The biggest swing is Subsea of sure. I mean, it was reasonably probable last year and unreasonably loss this year, if could say it that way. That's a single biggest thing. Pretty much everything tracking, I think, Consumer Devices down a little bit kind of hanging around the same margin level we have been, but I think the good news is that consistent margin in the Industrial business company and the Transportation business now operating at consistently above 20%.", "That transportation business can move from 22% to 21% to [20% to 20.5%] depending on mix in the region we are selling in, but what I am really happy about it is it is consistently above 20%. We feel it will be consistently above 20.", "Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs", "That's helpful. Thank you. Then maybe you could just help me understand specifically what we should be expecting for restructuring savings for this year and then into next year. My understanding was there should have been about $100 million of savings that the company was expecting to realize in fiscal '15, but sounds like there were some reinvestments going on, and maybe you could just help me understand what the net savings now we should be thinking about now?", "Bob Hau", "Yes. The restructuring benefit for a 2014 is about $80 million. We have been saying $70 million to $80 million. We are at the upper end of that range. Our expenditures is a little bit about what we were anticipating in the first half of the year, so there is a slightly more benefit accrued.", "A big chunk of that benefit is associated with the large restructuring actions we took last year, so we got some of the benefits in '13, we get the majority of the benefit in 2014. I would expect a more nominal benefit in thousand '15. We will give some color around that when we give 2015 guidance at the end of the fourth quarter.", "Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you very much.", "Bob Hau", "Thank you.", "Sujal Shah", "", "Thanks, Mark. Can we have next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fox. Please go ahead.", "Steven Fox - Cross Research ", "Thanks. Good morning. Two questions from me. First of all, just to be clear on the SubCom business. It lost money last quarter. It looks like it lost more $0.02 per share than you were thinking going into the quarter, but you are saying that the next couple of quarters the loss sort of don't get any worse and start to improve mid-year next fiscal year. Can you give us an idea of when breakeven will come back?", "Secondly, just on the Auto market, just to be clear, it looks like auto production ticked up a little bit more than you would have said 90 days ago, your Transportation sales are basically unchanged, so was there anything you saw in the channel in terms of inventory build that made you sort of maintain the sales outlook you have relative to what is going on in the end demand? Thanks.", "Tom Lynch", "Yes. Let me answer the second one on Auto. I mean, you know, the industry numbers, they are always getting refined. We have pretty good visibility into what our customers are telling us to build for them and it is a strong fourth quarter. Sure by far the strongest since I have been here.", "There isn't any underlying conclusion to draw from that Steve, I think it's the strong fourth quarter and we will see how it plays out, but we at this time in a quarter, we are responding to what the customers are telling us to build.", "Could it be a little better or worse? Yes, but it's not going to be - I would be surprised if it was materially different and we don't really see any inventory issues. We are not hearing anything around that kind of watch outs and we are pretty plugged into that.", "The first part of your question on SubCom, I think, yes. You summed it up. It has cost relative to where we were before few cents versus our guidance. 90 days ago, we offset that with other improvements, which is the good news and that's kind of early I would Q2 to start to be profitable again, but we will get specific on our guidance, we will give a little granularity there.", "We will be further into the projects and see at what rate they are building, but we are hiring people in New Hampshire. That's the ultimate sign, because we don't do that unless the designs are pretty much finished and customers are ready to eat get going, so that's why we are feeling better, but not giddy given how the last few years have been in SubCom.", "Steven Fox - Cross Research ", "Understandable, I appreciate the color. Thanks.", "Tom Lynch", "Welcome.", "Sujal Shah", "", "Thanks, Steve. The next question please?", "Operator", "Your final question today comes from the line of Shawn Harrison. Please go ahead.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Hi. Just following up on the SubCom, Tom, as you gave with within Network Solutions implies that business lost $15 million to $20 million in the June quarter. Am I in the right ballpark with that math?", "Tom Lynch", "Yes.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Okay. I guess, maybe the better question is, when do you expect it to break even again?", "Bob Hau", "Yes, Shawn. I think, with risk of avoiding giving guidance too early, I think it's going to be in the first half of next year. I want to see us, how do we come out of this quarter, at what run rate on the projects.", "As I said, we are hiring the people. That means we are building the cable. Once the ships get in the water with the cable, then historically jobs run very consistently other than weather, but we always have that.", "The key thing is, get the award, get the down payment, that's happened. Start building the cable, that's starting. Then get the cable on the ships and the ships are in the, we are actually starting to lay cable and then it's a lot easier to predict, but that's how I feel about it right now.", "Certainly, our team has a strong view of what is going to happened, but before I go out there with more granularity, I would like to see how we come out of this last quarter of the year.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "That's fair. Then just on SEACON. What is the EBIT margin projected to be for that business? I think, initially it was like a 30% EBIT margin, which would imply something like $0.07 to $0.08 of maybe potential EPS accretion in 2015, but if any more granularity on the profitability of SEACON, as we enter 2015?", "Bob Hau", "Yes. Shawn. It's Bob. The business is about, call it, $120 million of revenue and when we announced the acquisition, we did indicate that they do about 30% EBITA margin, so you got the numbers right. Obviously, we haven't given 2015 guidance for the total company. Certainly, not for SEACON at this point in time, but that is that 30% EBITDA margin of pre-acquisition.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Okay. Would you expect a lot of integration costs? If so would that just fall into 2014?", "Tom Lynch", "There is not a lot of integration costs and we just completed the deal, so we are now in the midst of bringing that company into the full, but there is not significant restructuring solution with it.", "Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research", "Okay. Thanks so much.", "Bob Hau", "Thanks, Shawn.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks, everybody, for your questions. Just a few closing comments, I'm excited because we are coming down the stretch of a very good year for the company.", "As I mentioned earlier, we expect to deliver 5% organic growth overcoming an incredibly weak SubCom business, 17% adjusted EPS growth and another tremendous year of free cash flow.", "Our harsh environment portfolio is performing very well. We are really pleased with that and we also are continuing to strengthen the company with the strategic acquisitions of SEACON and Measurement Specialties.", "As Bob indicated, we will continue to consistently return capital to shareholders, so I think we have very balanced capital allocation strategy, I think we have a balanced business strategy and I feel good about where the company is positioned.", "Thanks again for joining us this morning and have a good day and a great rest of the summer.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 10:30 Eastern Time today through July 30th.", "You may access the AT&T TeleConference replay system at any time by dialing 1-800-475-6701 and entering access code 329466. International participants dial 320-365-3844. Those numbers once again are 1-800-475-6701 or 320-365-3844, with the access code 329466.", "That does conclude your conference for today.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Sujal Shah. Please go ahead, sir.", "Sujal Shah", "Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2014 results. With me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch; and Chief Financial Officer, Bob Hau.", "During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information, and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release.", "In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning. We ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that addresses the use of these items.", "The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com. [Operator Instructions]", "Now let me turn the call over to Tom for opening comments.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Thanks, Sujal, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Here are some highlights of the call, and then we'll go into this in more detail over the balance of the call. We delivered strong results for fiscal year 2014, achieving our -- or exceeding all our business model targets. I feel very good about how we continue to execute our strategy of strengthening our leadership position in harsh environment applications, with another strong year of design wins in Auto, Industrial and Appliances. We also made key acquisitions in sensors and oil and gas, which significantly expand our TAM. For 2015, the midpoint of our guidance reflects 8% actual revenue growth, 6% organic revenue growth and double-digit adjusted earnings growth. The benefits of recent acquisitions, the rebound of the SubCom business and solid performance in the transportation and industrial segments will more than offset a slight slowing in EMEA and China, as well as currency headwind.", "We do have multiple levers below the top line to drive EPS growth, most notably our TEOA program, which is really helping us improve customer satisfaction and driving productivity as evidenced by our margins.", "And then lastly, but not least, of course, we expect to generate continued strong free cash flow growth, enabling us to return approximately 2/3 of our cash to shareholders while continuing to strengthen the company through acquisitions.", "Now please turn to Slide 3. Q4 was a strong finish to a record year for the company. Sales were just shy of $3.6 billion and up roughly 4% year-over-year. Adjusted EPS of $1.02 was up 10% at the high end of our guidance and free cash flow was $661 million.", "Our Q4 results were driven by the continued strong performance of our Transportation and Industrial Solutions segment, as well as our Appliance business in our Consumer segment. Growth in these businesses more than offset weakness in our SubCom market, which has now bottomed -- which has bottomed and is now earning a growth cycle. So in a nutshell, Q4 results really continued what we saw through the first 3 quarters of the year.", "Please turn to Slide 4. I'm really pleased with what our team accomplished in the fiscal year 2014. We delivered strong financial performance, strengthened our leadership position in harsh connectivity and expanded our TAM through a major sensor acquisition. Our sales growth was 5%, overcoming the bottoming out of the SubCom market. Adjusted operation -- operating margins were 15.4%, primarily powered by our TEOA program, and this was a very key milestone for the company to get through a full year at 15-plus in operating margin at less than $14 billion of revenue.", "Adjusted earnings per share grew 17% and we generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow, our seventh consecutive year of 10% or better cash flow yield on revenue. We continued to execute our long-term strategy of extending our leadership position in harsh environment applications, which are highly engineered, designed in partnership with our customers and characterized by relatively longer product cycles and margins above company average. Our Transportation and Industrial segments as well as our Appliances business continue to generate design wins at rates ahead of market growth, which positions -- which strengthens our long-term market position.", "We also made these 2 key acquisitions establishing us as the leader in offshore oil and gas and the high-growth sensors market. Measurement Specialties establishes us as a leading supplier of sensors and connectors, adds nearly $40 billion to our addressable market and further increases our content in harsh applications. Overall, our harsh businesses now account for approximately 70% of company revenue, up from the 50% range a few years ago and are generating operating margins above the company average.", "This is our wheelhouse, so to speak, and we will continue to accelerate investment into these businesses.", "With the addition of a broad sensors portfolio, TE owns valuable real estate that serves as a gateway for customers to collect and analyze data, whether in Automotive, Industrial, Communications or Consumer Applications.", "In our short cycle businesses, Consumer Devices and Data Communications, this was a tough year for financial performance, but a year of progress in innovation, key customer design-ins and continued cost improvements. As a result of this progress, I expect that these businesses will be contributors to the company's earnings growth in fiscal 2015.", "In our networks business, it was a mixed year in terms of financial performance but a good year in terms of strategic progress. SubCom bottomed out in fiscal 2014, with less than $300 million in revenue and generated an operating loss. On the bright side, we had an excellent year winning key projects and these projects are now coming into force.", "In our Broadband Network Solutions business, which includes telecom and enterprise, we had a solid year. Sales growth returned for the first time in 3 years and profitability improved for the second consecutive year.", "I'll now provide some detail by business within each segment in the next 4 slides. Unless I indicate otherwise, all changes are on an organic basis, which excludes the effect of currencies, acquisitions and divestitures. Please turn to Slide 5.", "Our Transportation business had another outstanding year in fiscal 2014, with 10% growth and 20%-plus operating margins. Content growth is driven by new safety features, higher emission standards and the broadening adoption of infotainment applications, which require increased data transfer, more electrical connections and more sensors. Electronic growth is a strong secular driver that will continue to fuel growth for TE. Last year's results clearly demonstrate how our company is benefiting from electronic content expansion and importantly, an increased new platform win rate in both the Automotive and Industrial Transportation business. As our revenue growth more than doubled OEM production growth of 5%. I really feel the investments we made in the downturn are paying off big time for us in this business.", "Q4 was another strong quarter with sales of $1.5 billion, up 6% over the prior year, outpacing global vehicle production growth of 2.8%. We delivered adjusted operating margins of 20%-plus due to the volume growth and continued productivity improvements driven by TEOA.", "Looking forward, we expect another good quarter in Q1, with actual sales up approximately 10%, including about 10 or 11 weeks of Measurement Specialties revenue.", "Please turn to Page 6. Our Industrial business performed very well in fiscal 2014. Revenue of $3.3 billion was up 6.6% and 5% organically. Adjusted operating margins increased 80 basis points to 14.7%. We had strong performance in Asia and the U.S., more than offsetting a relatively flat European market. In Q4, revenue was up 10% due to strong organic growth of 6%, coupled with the acquisition of SEACON in our Oil and Gas business. Within this segment, Commercial Aerospace, Oil and Gas and Industrial Equipment grew mid-single digits in the quarter and the full year. Our robust organic product pipeline coupled with the Deutsche and SEACON acquisitions has positioned us very well in these attractive markets, which we believe have strong underlying secular trends that should provide attractive growth for years to come.", "The Industrial Equipment market is growing again and our industrial equipment business has exhibited strong growth over the past 5 quarters, benefiting from our increased focus on factory automation markets as well as a strong rail market in China.", "Our Energy business grew 2% in the year, with strength in Asia and an improving U.S. environment, being offset by a weak European market. Overall, this was a very good year for the industrial solutions segment and we expect 2015 to be a good year as well due to our strong position in these harsh environment markets.", "Please turn to Page 7. In Q4, sales in the Network segment were down 3% versus the prior year due to declines in our SubCom business. Adjusted operating margins of 9% were down slightly from last year due to losses in SubCom. SubCom did grow 65% sequentially, and we are confident the business is now moving into a growth cycle. We now have 3 programs that have come into force. The AAE-1 project, which connects Asia, Africa and Europe, was announced in April. Last quarter, we announced the Hibernia project, which will connect New York and London. And then earlier this month, you should have seen an announcement regarding Project Monet [ph], which is a program involving Google that connects Latin America with the U.S. On a combined basis, these projects are worth over $900 million over the next 2 to 3 years and with that, we now expect SubCom revenues to grow approximately $300 million in 2015 based upon these programs.", "So in a nutshell, the SubCom business is turning from a headwind into a tailwind in '15. Our Broadband Network Solutions business, consisting of Telecom and Enterprise, was roughly flat in the quarter. We did see some project delays in the U.S. and that was partially offset by continued growth in our data center -- in the data center market. For the full year 2014, BNS delivered organic sales growth of 3% and increased profitability. So it was a good steady -- a year of steady progress in our business in these markets. Our DataComm business was down slightly in Q4 due to a week market in Japan.", "In Q1, we expect total Network Solutions revenues to be up low single digits versus the prior year as SubCom growth offsets slightly lower spending in the U.S. broadband market.", "For the full year, we expect roughly 10% growth in Network Solutions, primarily due to the SubCom strength. And we also expect to deliver significant improvement in operating margins driven by these volume increases and continued productivity improvements.", "Please turn to Slide 8. Performance in our Consumer business was in line with our expectations in Q4. Revenue was down slightly. We did see continued strength in our market-leading Appliance businesses, and this was offset by lower revenue in our Consumer Devices business. For the full year of 2014, organic revenue declined about 1%. That's similar to Q4, devices decline offset appliance growth. Adjusted operating margin exceeded 10% for the second consecutive year in this segment. For fiscal 2015, we expect this segment to deliver low single digit organic growth and a continued improvement in operating margins. We expect another good -- very good year in our appliance business and stable performance in Consumer Devices. Our devices strategy continues to be a selective one.", "Now let me turn it over to Bob. He's going to cover the financials in more detail.", "Robert W. Hau", "Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Let me discuss earnings, which starts on Slide 9. Adjusted operating income was $571 million, up 6% versus the prior year. GAAP operating income was $521 million and included $17 million of restructuring and other charges, most of which were in the Network segment and $33 million of acquisition-related charges in the quarter. Full year restructuring and other charges were $59 million.", "Adjusted operating margin was 16%, up 30 basis points from Q4 last year. And the improvement versus the prior year is driven by improved manufacturing productivity across the company and volume leverage in the Transportation and Industrial segments. Adjusted EPS were $1.02 and GAAP EPS were $1.60 for the quarter. GAAP EPS included the acquisition-related charges of $0.08, restructuring and other charges of $0.02, and a tax benefit of $0.68. The tax benefit primarily stems from the increased ability to utilize U.S. net operating losses based on forecasted future taxable income and the integration of SEACON.", "For the full year 2015, I expect approximately $50 million to $75 million of restructuring and other charges reflecting $0.09 at the midpoint, roughly flat versus last year. We expect roughly $0.23 of charges associated with the recent acquisitions, which will be more than offset by reserve reversals from favorable tax settlement of non-intercompany debt pre-separation tax liabilities.", "Turning to Slide 10. Our adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 33.6%. This is roughly flat versus the prior year and up 50 basis points excluding SubCom. Total operating expenses were $631 million in the quarter, with SG&A increasing versus the prior year to support growth initiatives but declining as a percentage of sales year-over-year.", "On the right side of the slide, net interest expense was $31 million in the fourth quarter, and I expect $31 million of expense in the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted other income, which primarily relates to our tax sharing agreement was $6 million. And in the first quarter, I expect other income of about $8 million.", "The GAAP income tax rate of minus 34% was driven by the one-time gain previously mentioned. The adjusted effective tax rate was 22.3% and I expect full year adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 24% for 2015.", "Turning to Slide 11. I'll discuss our balance sheet and free cash flow. Cash flow from continuing operations was $754 million and our fee cash flow in the quarter was $661 million. Gross capital expenditures were roughly flat year-over-year. However, we did see a decline in net capital spending to $93 million. During the quarter, we sold an underutilized asset generating approximately $100 million of cash. I expect capital spending rate to be approximately 5% of sales in 2015.", "Working capital was in line with our expectations, with receivable days outstanding at 61 days, inventory days on hand at 65 days, and payable days outstanding, 53 days.", "Now let me discuss the sources and uses of cash outside of free cash flow, shown on the right side of the slide. We began the quarter with $1.6 billion of cash and increased this to $2.5 billion at the end of the quarter in anticipation of completing the Measurement acquisition, which closed on October 9. During the quarter, we utilized $504 million to support acquisitions, primarily SEACON. We also returned a total of $283 million to shareholders. We paid dividends of $119 million and repurchased 2.6 million shares for $164 million. Outstanding debt grew to $3.9 billion at the end of the quarter, reflecting the added debt for the Measurement Specialties acquisition.", "Now I'll turn it back to Tom.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Thanks, Bob. Please turn to Slide 12 and I'll cover our outlook. Although the environment is a bit more uncertain than 90 days ago, we do expect to deliver another solid quarter in Q1, with revenue of $3.46 billion to $3.56 billion, up 4% to 7% year-over-year and in line with our normal seasonal patterns. We expect adjusted EPS of $0.88 to $0.92, which is an increase of 7% to 12% year-over-year. Our Q1 outlook does include a headwind from currency exchange rates, which are negatively affecting our guidance by approximately $100 million in revenue and $0.03 to $0.04 per share in EPS versus the prior year.", "In Q1, we expect 10% growth in transportation, including contributions from Measurement Specialties. We are assuming global auto production to be up 1% to 2%, which is what the industry is guiding to versus the prior year. We expect Industrial Solutions to be up mid-single digits versus last year, with solid growth in the U.S. and Asia more than offsetting softness in Europe. We expect double-digit growth in the Aerospace and Oil and Gas businesses driven by strong organic growth and revenue contribution from SEACON.", "Network Solutions is expected to be up low single digits led by growth in our SubCom business as we discussed before with 3 programs now in force. And we expect our Consumer Solutions business to be down mid-single digits as growth in Appliances more than offset our continued slower device business.", "Now please turn to Slide 13. Our strong performance across the company in 2014 positions us for another year of solid sales, profit and EPS growth as we enter fiscal '15. We have a number of catalysts for growth, including the secular growth of electronic content; the SubCom recovery; the tremendous design win momentum across our harsh environment businesses; and the contributions from acquisitions in sensors and oil and gas. We expect momentum in these areas to more than offset some of the weakness we're seeing in Europe and China and headwinds from currency exchange rates.", "For the full year, we expect revenue of $14.7 billion to $15.3 billion, up 8% versus the prior year and reflecting 6% organic growth. We expected adjusted earnings per share of $4.05 to $4.35, an increase of 11% at midpoint. And our revenue and EPS guidance does include an approximate $400 million revenue and $0.15 a share EPS headwind due to the currency exchange rates versus the prior year that we mentioned earlier.", "In Transportation, based on 2.5% to 3% vehicle production growth, we expect mid-single digit or better organic revenue growth and double-digit growth, including contributions from Measurement Specialties. We expect Industrial Solutions to be up mid-single digits versus last year on an organic and actual basis. The benefits of the SEACON acquisition are offsetting the negative impact of currency. Organically, we expect strong growth in our Aerospace and Oil and Gas businesses, single digit growth in Industrial Equipment and continued low single digit growth in Energy, which has most of its business in Europe. Network Solutions is expected to be up approximately 10% this year with most of the growth being driven by strength in the SubCom business. And we expect our Consumer Solutions business to be about flat versus last year with the same trends we've been seeing, strong performance in Appliances, which we expect in the low to mid-single digits and offset by slight declines in consumer devices.", "We have covered a lot of ground today as always, and I'll make a few points before we move to Q&A. Despite the somewhat uncertain times we're in, and the indicators, as you all know, are bouncing around quite a bit, it feels like they're generally positive, more than negative, recently. But there is uncertainty out there. We feel the most important thing is that the underlying secular trends driving our business are very strong. And in this increasingly connected world, TE is really well positioned with our tremendous range of connectivity and sensor solutions that are so critical to that connected world. We also continue to strengthen the company's leadership in harsh application markets as we've said. And in 2015, this will account for approximately 75% of our total revenue. And we've made key acquisitions to broaden our TAM and give us more opportunity for growth.", "Just as important as any of this, we continue to improve our execution, driven by our TEOA program, and you can see it in our operating margins exceeding 15%. Our net margins exceeding 11%. And in Q4, we're just under 12% and our cash flow meeting or exceeding 10% of revenue for the seventh consecutive year. So I feel like we have the operating side of this business moving very well. And we continue to have a balanced capital allocation program and expect to return about 2/3 of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase.", "So a very good year, and looking for another solid year in '15. So operator, let's now open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I have a question and a follow-up. I guess, Tom, maybe you can start with the Networking segment. You talked about how the funded backlog has gone up to about $900 million. Shall we talk about what is the total backlog number today, because I'm assuming it's much bigger than $900 million? And talking about the cycles starting to reaccelerate. The last time that we're in an up-cycle, revenues actually peaked, I think, at $320 million, $330 million, the revenues up. So I'm curious what's the backlog broadly? And do you think that level of peak could be feasible over the 2 years, maybe?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Sure, Amit. The $900 million really relates to those 3 big projects. We have awards that aren't in backlog well above that. And as you know, as we've said before, we don't really put it into backlog until we have a down payment. So these 3, we also have a base level of maintenance business that goes on year in and year out, and it's more like a regular business where you get orders quarterly to do work for our customers. So this $900 million is really what's going to lift us from the level of what we were at last year in the $250 million to $300 million range, to the kind of the $550 million to $600 million range. We think it bodes very well for how the cycles, to the second part of your question, typically go. We have seen a pickup in bidding, so we would expect that this is really the indication of the cycle picking up and yes, it did peak at over $1 billion several years ago. When we model everything and the demands on bandwidth, the age of certain networks under the sea, the desire for more and more redundancy, it all says that this should be another very strong cycle.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Perfect. And then I guess, just as a follow-up, Bob, if you could maybe just talk about the Measurement Specialties acquisition. You have a few other things moving around in the models, it's unclear to me. But maybe you just talk about for fiscal '15? In the past, you had talked about $0.04 to $0.06 of accretion for Measurement. My math shows it's probably a $600 million-plus revenue, $0.10 accretion based on what you guys are talking about right now. So could you just maybe confirm that? And also just talk about what's the December quarter impact for Measurement? And if there are one-time charges like inventory adjustments and so on, that you intend to flow through the model for Measurement Specialties, I guess?", "Robert W. Hau", "Sure, Amit. First off, your numbers are essentially on what we described when we announced the acquisition of Measurement was, the business was, call it a, $550 million revenue business and we anticipated generating mid-single digit EPS of $0.04 to $0.06. With our guidance here in 2015, our revenue is about $600 million. Obviously, there's some growth in the market. We're seeing good content growth across the space. And from an EPS standpoint, it's probably about $0.10, a little bit better than we initially guided. Part of that is better performance. We've now have been doing some due diligence and integration -- pre-integration work, now owned it for a couple of weeks. And we're seeing slightly better performance coming into 2015, as well as there is some restructuring. And when we gave that $0.04 to $0.06, we indicated that did include some modest restructuring. There's not a big restructuring play with the acquisition, but there's some modest restructuring, and that will be dialed out. We're continuing with the $50 million to $75 million of restructuring that I talked that are in GAAP earnings but not adjusted earnings. It does include the integration or the restructuring that we'd have associated with Measurement. And in terms of impact to the December quarter, if you take those numbers and roughly divide by 4, there is some seasonality into that, but you won't be too far off. In terms of what's baked into the numbers, the near-term amortization of things like the inventory step-up and the backlog step-up will be excluded from earnings and included in GAAP but not included in adjusted earnings.", "Operator", "We do have a question from the line of Mike Wood from Macquarie.", "Mike Wood - Macquarie Research", "You gave a lot of color on the SubCom sales outlook. Can you just describe if there's anything unusual in the project recognition? I know you discussed this last quarter on the call, how the accounting may differ there and how profit margins might look throughout the year?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Right. I think it's really -- Mike, thank you for the question. It's -- what we said -- said last time, that the business really goes in phases, especially when you're ramping up or ramping down. So ramping up in the beginning, you're doing a lot of planning. You're -- we now -- we've actually doubled the number of people at our New Hampshire factory where we build the cable for the projects that are on this side of the world. And so you typically have lower profitability early on. We do percentage of completion recognition, but just the nature of the business when you're early in the project and have 98% of it to complete, you'll -- what we've always been, is you're a little more conservative in the early part of project because you don't know what the unexpecteds are going to be. No change in how we do it. We would expect that as we ramp to the kind of $0.5 billion range, it's mid-single digit type of OI margins from where we are today. And then when we get back to the normal range, which is more that $650 million to $750 million, that's when you see it being in -- closer to the company average. So we actually expect the same patterns as last time.", "Mike Wood - Macquarie Research", "And then in terms of the following-up on network, x Subsea, you're guiding to relatively flat for next year. Can you maybe give some color on that maybe by region? I understand the U.S. Telco CapEx backdrop is challenging, but I know you're increasingly exposed to the higher growth fiber rollout.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Sure. I expect it to be similar to this year. I'm hopeful that it will be better than that because I do believe in all the modeling we do that there's pent-up demand, but we have been off on that in our -- I've been off on that in our estimates of the last few years. The nice thing is the fiber/copper crossover has happened, and so copper is a much smaller part of the total buildout and fiber continues to grow at double-digit, and that's really our sweet spot. It tends to be much more project oriented business. And this year, this past year, we saw strength in Europe. A couple of significant builds. We saw mixed in the U.S., I expect the U.S. to pick up in the second half because the newcomers into the U.S. market are starting to really build momentum and we are doing very, very well with them. So it is a little bit of a mixed bag, as you say. But I think we're positioned well, we're cost efficient in the business. It is a double-digit margin business that we've improved the last couple of years and we've really structured it to be a very low growth business but be able to take advantage and therefore, get the higher flow-throughs on the margin as we grow above low single digits. Does that get at your question?", "Mike Wood - Macquarie Research", "Yes, it does.", "Operator", "We do have a question from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.", "Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "A question on MEAS, Tom. If you look at that company, they've been fairly acquisitive small deals prior to you guys taking them out, can you just talk about kind of the pipeline of M&A potential in that space? And then also, what MEAS does for TEL in terms of your sales approach and being more strategic to OEM customers.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Sure. I'll answer the second part first because that's really the strategic theory behind the acquisition that we have all these resources at these customers. And not unusual when you're a smaller company, you have to be much more selective in who you go after. With us, we're in with all of them early in the architecture. So we're only 2 weeks officially into it, but our team, I know, is even more excited than they were 3 or 4 months ago, because we just see more and more of the depths of Measure's capabilities and products. And I think we feel very comfortable with the revenue synergies and we're getting more comfortable that, over time, it's going to probably be a little better than we thought. So that idea of our scale with the customer and resources in front of the customer, with their product line, is bearing out. It's still early, we have to deliver and all that, and nobody's taking anything for granted. And the teams are coming together very nicely. So that's -- I think that's as important as anything else. There seems to be real chemistry and the MEAS team is taking a significant leadership role in the business. The second part, the acquisition pipeline. Yes, I mean, we're still -- our #1 priority is to make MEAS and AST successful, get them integrated, no question about it. At the same time, where we can see opportunities that make sense to round out what we have, we're going to be in those conversations. But our team knows that the #1 priority is to integrate this and make this one team and very successful as we laid out when we announced the acquisition. And that is why we went with a company like MEAS that had that broad range, so that we could -- we didn't have to -- they did the roll-up and we didn't want to have to get into that kind of strategy in order to become a major sensor player. So don't be surprised as we add on to the portfolio with sensors, but #1 priority is clearly to execute what we have now.", "Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Very clear. And as a follow-up, you mentioned some near-term uncertainty in the environment. So granted, it looks like you have some growth drivers to kind of help you get through. But on the environment, any other color you can add in terms of just what you're hearing from customers, how they're managing inventory and kind of how business trended September into October here?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Yes, sure. As you can imagine, we've been -- we're always in front of the customer, but I have been talking to a lot more customers than normal lately, and part of that is just around what are you seeing out there, and that's the first question they ask me, too. So I don't think anybody has any particular advantage. It's mixed. I think we've seen, we saw late in the fourth quarter and early in the first quarter, the order rate dip, but then it's picked up. The last couple of weeks, how much the big dip in the stock market affected everybody's psyche. I know that seemed to make everybody a little, including us, more nervous, as that's going to have people get more cautious. But I'd say there's some positive indicators that doesn't mean there isn't uncertainty, but European car registrations are still positive, right? I think I would -- we would've been worried they were going to dip into the negative. So that's a really good thing. The consumer confidence in the U.S. is up. So that's a positive thing. It's always hard to call China, but we're coming off a double-digit growth in China again. So I'd say it feels a little more uncertain than when I was talking to you 90 days ago, but you can't put your finger on it. It's not as if, \"Wow, something has really dropped off.\" And in our biggest business, Transportation, steady as she goes with the order rate. So that's kind of it. I think we expect, no question, that our businesses with our customers in Europe will be a little bit slower in '15 than '14. I mean they were pretty robust in '14 and probably a little bit slower in China. But it's not -- it's slower growth, it's not decline. And we think that'll be offset with a little bit better in the U.S. and then these other tailwinds we have, like the acquisitions and SubCom. It feels like a pretty, obviously, we think it's a balanced look right now. It's always hard to guide next year at this time of the year when we're only in October, and nobody else is out there really talking about it officially, but that's how we see it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Amitabh Passi from UBS.", "Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Tom, I had a question and a follow-up. I wanted to go back to Network Solutions. If I look at that segment, I think x Subsea, we have peak sales in fiscal '11 at about $3.1 billion. Your guidance for fiscal '15 implies $2.6 billion. So we're still down about 15%. Just wondering, is there anything else you need to do in the segment in terms of rightsizing the cost structure? Do you feel the rest of the segment is fairly optimal? Because it still seems like structurally, we're well below where we were 4 years ago.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Yes, a couple of points there. As Bob mentioned, I think Bob mentioned, if he didn't he probably will. We have been doing that. So both with -- since the revenue hasn't materialized as we expected. We certainly have been doing a significant amount of that and a large portion of our restructuring in the past year was geared at that segment. We -- it's really a few things. I feel like in the Broadband space, we're very well positioned. We have an excellent product line, we're winning a higher rate of fiber awards than we did 3 or 4 years ago because -- and it really is the benefit of the ADC acquisition. But no question, the market has been a lot softer than I thought. So you have a little bit of that, and we have taken a fair amount of cost out in response to that. And we're evaluating. But right now, I think, we feel like we're close to being at the right place from a cost structure. Because I am hesitant, having lived through the automotive downturn when we decided we're going to invest and certainly not cut, that it helped us. Now I know this is a different market, it's more volatile and it's not an automotive market, but we also don't want to cut into muscle yet, that's how I feel about the business. And I'm getting more optimistic about the outlook. The DataComm business is really a bigger issue for us because we had -- we always trailed in sort of this mid-speed communication product line and we made the decision many years ago to go to high-speed and sort of do a leapfrog strategy. We have a pretty good 25-gig plus product range in fiber and copper. It's adapting -- being adopted, I should say, very slowly in the market given all the change that's going on in the Communications Equipment market. So a little bit of a double whammy on us that we -- and we're still investing and I'm not ready to back-off the investment in high-speed because I think that would be shortsighted at this point. And so we're still investing. And the high-speed market hasn't really materialized. In the mid-speed where we're weak, we're not benefiting there. So DataComm is a business that's a mid-single digit kind of margin business. SubCom will get back to its normal over-the-cycle solid double-digit and that's strictly cycle, because we're executing well there. And BNS, which is $2 billion of that network segment for us, total revenue is $2 billion, that's low double-digits, which is up 2 years in a row. So I do feel like, for sure, the cost actions we're taking are paying off. And we're poised. We have a great product line as things pick up a little bit to really capitalize on it.", "Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And just a quick follow-up for me, Tom, just on the Subsea business. As we move to higher-speed rates of 100-gig, 200-gig, 400-gig, do you feel you guys have the active electronics portfolio fairly well established, or is there scope there for partnership and maybe even M&A?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "I feel like we have it fairly well -- very well established. I mean, we have led in the long-haul fiber transmission since it started. And this was a -- 15, 18 years ago really an AT&T-type, Bell Labs business. And that's the heritage and DNA we still have in that business. And it's an extraordinary group of talented engineers in North Jersey. So they are constantly driving the distances and the cost-per-bit down, and doing a lot of other things to enable our customers to have dedicated links within the cables providing tremendous amount of flexibility. So I do feel very confident about that. There's no guarantees, obviously, but we have not -- that's another one where even with the down cycle, and this team knows from being in it from the very beginning, you have to keep pushing the technology through the down cycle and we've done that. So I feel good about our position there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin from Stifel.", "Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "I just wanted to ask a question to clarify the restructuring charges. Bob, you talked about, for FY '15. How much of that is related to acquisitions versus other activities?", "Robert W. Hau", "What we described was $50 million to $75 million of expenses over the year, roughly in line at the midpoint of that with what we spent in 2014. And what we said is really an ongoing level of restructuring. Obviously, we have been investing significantly higher than that in prior years, but we think this business and the way the markets run, that $50 million to $75 million of spending is kind of a run rate. And roughly, 15% of that or so is associated with acquisitions. Again, none of our -- the larger acquisitions, SEACON, Measurement and AST, which is a smaller one for that matter, not a lot of significant cost takeout. It's more of adding to our portfolio and getting the revenue synergies, but there's a bit of that coming through in 2015.", "Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "So for the business, then, is that still predominantly focused on the networking area where you've been focusing your restructuring efforts, or is it just tweaking across the business?", "Robert W. Hau", "It's tweaking across the business, if you look at the spending that we did in 2014, we spent about $60 million, almost 60% of that was in networks alone. And as you look at our businesses, those that have below company average margins and below our margin expectations, networks and consumers, obviously, those are ones that we're looking more closely at for cost opportunities.", "Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay, that's great. And just another question on Measurement Specialties, if I can. Just regarding, Tom, the cross-selling opportunities. I know the big opportunity is to cross-sell that technology into passenger vehicles. What kind of time horizon or opportunity are we talking about in terms of the selling cycles?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "I would say, on average, it's going to be 2 to 3 years. There's some opportunities that will be in the 2-year range. The really sweet opportunities are more in the 3-year range just because that's just the typical design-in cycle. So in our model, when we bought them, we did not have any significant revenue from automotive until Year 3. We also have, across the portfolio, and it's primarily in the harsh businesses, but opportunities in Appliance, opportunities in Industrial Equipment and Industrial Transportation, much longer cycle in ADNM, so they're not really baked into sort of the model for the acquisition. But what's really potent about having both -- having a full range of sensors too, not just 1 or 2 technologies, but having a full range, having thin seen gauge wire, all the connectivity that we have, our material science-based businesses, that connect and protect things. When we go into a customer now, we can really offer some creative solutions on how to solve problems, the next generation of appliances, how do you substantially simplify the wiring harness, which if you look inside an appliance, I mean, it's kind of mind-numbing, the complexity of it, which makes repairs very complicated. So there's just so many opportunities. And what we're doing is we're being very deliberate with it because we don't want to get it out of focus. So it's prioritizing one at a time, getting success, and that's what we had baked into the acquisition. But we're very excited because it just opens up so much more of the customers' footprint, so to speak, or their real estate, so to speak, to us.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citi.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I just wanted to clarify, on your Q1 guidance for the Transportation sector. If I back out the Measurements acquisition, are we looking at revenues kind of being flat to maybe up 1% year-over-year? And if so, that seems like a below market or kind of what's going on there, is my math's incorrect?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "I think -- I know it's murky. We don't have MEAS for the full quarter. But what we have in there for organic growth is right around 5% based on -- it's in that 4.5% to 5% range based on a 2% to 3% -- I should say, 1% to 2% production range. And right now, as I mentioned earlier, the order rate in that business is very solid. So no, we wouldn't expect our -- we're not seeing anything that would say that we're going to drift down into low single-digit organic growth.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Great. And then with the gradual adoptions of more hybrid technology, more sensors, electronics in cars and electronic cars, is there a chance that the typical content range starts to increase the higher end or even above that higher end of the range? Or is there other obsolescences going on that will just keep it within that normal historical range? I think historically, connectors have grown, with kind of 6% to 8%, less a 2% ASP decline, is that the way to think of it?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "It's in the ballpark. I definitely think if there's more, let's say, there's more likelihood of it moving to the higher end of the range than the lower end of the range, I mean, that's clearly what we're seeing. And we're at every OEM in virtually every electronic application. And that doesn't really -- today, we have, plus or minus -- in the ballpark of $60 million of our content, connectivity-related content. $60, I mean, per car roughly. We have $2 of sensor content. So about -- what we would estimate is somewhere in the neighborhood of 1% of the sensor market and now, we're going to bring in a full range of sensors and just the constant march of more electronics. I mean, every time you try to move the emission standards up, the engine control units get more sophisticated, the semiconductors have more pins, and the kind of connectors that go with them are very sophisticated and more valuable. So it's almost -- I agree with you. I would continue to see that move up. And that's certainly -- our strategic plan assumes that, and that's why we continue to invest aggressively in engineering in that business, and in M&A.", "Robert W. Hau", "Jim, it's Bob. I think I heard you say 6% to 8% content growth less 1% to 2% price. It's more like 4% to 6% content is what we've traditional seen. But as Tom points out, with some of the content growth and the growth in electronics and sensors, we'll see it at the upper end of that 4% to 6% range.", "Operator", "We do have a question from the line of Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research.", "Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC", "I wanted to get, I guess, looking at out over the next, say, 24 to 36 months with Measurement Specialties. In terms of just profitability, the implication is, maybe a mid-teens EBIT margin for this year based upon the updated guidance. Where do you think you can get that within the next 12 to 24 months? Should we be at a mid-20s EBIT margin, or is that too aggressive?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Time frame again, Shawn?", "Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC", "I would say within 24 months, run rate exiting 2 years from now.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "EBITDA range?", "Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC", "EBIT, EBITDA, either one is fair.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "I think, think of it this way. We would expect to improve it somewhere in the neighborhood of 200 basis points a year to 250 basis points, but the volume leverage being the biggest thing because it's not so much a cost play, as we said. And as we bring their products into the more attractive markets, which are the harsh environment markets. So there'll be some -- there'll be steady margin improvement in the next 24 months. But as we get designed into auto and into these other more harsh environments, that's when I would expect it to accelerate.", "Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC", "And this year, the EBITDA margin would actually be upper teens, then? Is that the correct number to use?", "Robert W. Hau", "Mid- to upper teens is about right.", "Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. And then I just want to focus in on the Consumer Solutions business. Appliances, you're doing fine. Consumer Devices, itself, we know the struggle. But I mean, what is the outlook, if we look over the next 12 to 24 months within that business, what can you either do to improve profitability or do you, at some point in time, walk away from the business, given the challenges you've faced so far?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Sure. The Appliance business, we're doing very well in. That is one of our best businesses and we are very -- feel very confident we grew faster than the market. And I was just listening to one of our big customers talk yesterday and their growth rates by market, and we're exceeding them in every market. So we're getting designed in and around the world at a faster rate than ever before and it's an excellent business. And it's a very harsh environment business in most appliances. In devices, think of us as retrenching -- I can't imagine us exiting it, because the products that we develop there, they do find their way into other applications, outside of the Consumer -- the Consumer applications. So in that business, that's where we get miniaturization. The smallest products we design, that's where you get, -- you usually have your initial breakthroughs on how you optimize the metals that you use, where automation often comes in first, kind of breakthrough automation. So the way I think of it is the core connectivity part of the business is strategic to the company. It would be a flank that I would not leave open, given that it's the devices, the pure devices part of the business is 5% of the company-type level. I think our core connector business in there is a decent business. It's the products around that, that are not quite where we need them to be at. So that's a business, as Bob mentioned, we've taken cost out of. A business that we continue to be very selective, much more selective on what we bid on than we were 2 or 3 years ago. So don't be surprised if they get smaller with better margins before it gets larger.", "Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Is the business profitable currently, the devices?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Yes, it is.", "Operator", "We do have a question from the line of William Stein with SunTrust.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "I'm hoping you can talk about the book-to-bill specifically, Tom. Earlier, you mentioned that orders took a dip in the quarter. I think you said they had recovered. Book-to-bill is below 1 overall and below 1 x SubCom in most of the segments as well. Is that sort of typical performance? Or if you contemplate that, including the more recent changes, let's say into the beginning of the current quarter, do those numbers look better? Is it more in line with typical? How should we think about that?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Sure. I would say when you look at Q4 on a typical book-to-bill for Q4, but a little mix in there, probably a little better in Transportation and a little lighter in Industrial. And it's really, those are the business where the book-to-bill, I think, is most indicative. In our Networks and SubCom business it doesn't really mean that much because you can get releases against a big project. And so -- and book-to-bill at a moment in time, doesn't mean that much. As we -- the book-to-bill is positive so far in the first quarter. It's too early to read into that, but I'd say the last couple of week's orders look more like what we'd expect in a solid economy. But that's got to last. And as I said earlier, even when things are less uncertain, I'm always a little more nervous at this time in our quarter, because we come into the holidays and our Industrial and Automotive businesses are sizable in Europe. And we've seen occasionally, over time, unpredictability in the length of holidays, so I don't think it's anything unusual, but it's just, this is the hardest time of the year for us to call. But I'd say book-to-bills aren't really different from what we would expect, and that's why we are guiding the way we're guiding.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "That's helpful. Maybe the next one is for Bob. I'm wondering if you can comment on FX. It seems to explain about all the difference between your guidance and what was, I think, broadly expected if you include Measurement? But I thought that you had been hedging FX. I'm a little surprised that it's having such a near-term effect?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Well, where we are, in fact, naturally hedged is on the transactional side of FX. So because we are very global in both our factory footprint, our sales footprint and our customer footprint, we buy and sell in typically the same currency, so we're largely naturally hedged. The FX impact that we're talking about, that impacted us in Q4, and now forecasted to impact us into 2015 is the translational side. We do not hedge translational. It's an accounting issue, it's not a free cash flow issue. And so the impact that we've talked about, the $400 million on revenue and the $0.15 on a full year basis is what we're seeing given the pretty significant strength in the dollar against essentially all currencies, but particularly for us, euro, yen and RMB are more of the big drivers for us.", "Operator", "We do have a question from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.", "Mark Trevor Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I know, Tom, you already talked about some of the sales opportunity with Measurement and the ability to cross-sell a broader range of products to some of the customers. I was hoping bit you could just also talk about the roadmap for products going forward. Is there any thought about doing integrated products where you'd be selling a full solution of a sensor with a connector, maybe, and some software on it, and moving further up the value chain?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Sure. I would say, again, since we just completed the acquisition and while we did pre-integration planning and all those kinds of things, you can't really get inside until the deal closed. But having said that, part of our strategic objective is to be more than just a sensor seller. More than just well, we'll now carry -- we're already carrying a bag with connectors into the customer, now, we'll put sensors in the bag. That's the earliest. So the first synergy is through the channel. The second synergy is, hey, we just have more access to customers, as I've described earlier. But we do believe, absolutely with customers wanting fewer suppliers to simplify their world and suppliers who can provide more, so that they can get more value, which in some cases, it's, hey, I want a the solution that gives me less cost, or I want a solution that gives me less weight or less footprint. The more integration you can do, the better we will be. So I would say in the first year, think of it as experiments we'll be doing, right? We'll be picking a couple of customers, it's not going to be revenue in the near term. But seeing what's practical, what's doable, what's practical. But we already see from modules we do in some of our businesses, when we can integrate wire connectors and build a box for the customer that's smaller than if they had to do it themselves, there's value in that. So we definitely see that as a longer-term strategic objective. Now, we have to prove the theory.", "Operator", "We do have a question from the line of Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America.", "Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Tom, your comments indicate better U.S. outlook versus Europe and China in 2015. But when I look at the fourth quarter results on an organic basis that you just reported, it appears that the largest incremental year-on-year contribution actually came from APAC followed by EMEA and then U.S. was only $10 million incremental. So what are you seeing that would explain this reversal? And how much of it is potentially SubCom? And I have a follow-up.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "What I would say on that, Wamsi, is it's all -- what I mean, I'm talking from a relative perspective. So for us, Asia grew 7% to 8% for the year last year. China, over 11%. I think that's going to be down a little bit. Not a lot. For us, Europe grew the year, 5 percent-ish. I think that's going to be down a little bit. Again, it's still going to grow because of our strength with the German automakers and the amount that they export, et cetera. I think in the U.S., we'll expect to see the Appliance business continue to be solid. The Energy business, which really began to pick up in the second half of the year for us in the U.S., we see that trend continuing as there's pent-up maintenance and expansion there that we're benefiting from. I think Auto will probably be -- it's hard to call it flat. It was very strong last year, so slightly down. So that's really how I kind of see it. It's not that -- Asia will continue to grow -- have a higher growth rate than the U.S. because of the demographics over there. It's just relative change in growth year-over-year. That's really what I meant. I don't know if that gets at your question.", "Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Yes, yes, that's helpful, Tom. And Bob, can you maybe address what the hedge levels for copper and gold are? And what sort of margin benefit, if any, you're expecting in your guidance from metals pricing?", "Robert W. Hau", "Yes, so we hedge our copper, silver and gold on a monthly basis. So we look at our demand 18 months out, we take a position every month. So for the 2015 fiscal year, we'll probably call it 60%, 65% hedged for our overall demand. Tailwind, we had a really nice tailwind in 2014. It's a little bit less than that in 2015, call it, right now, about $20 million, $30 million of OI tailwind on a fiscal year basis.", "Operator", "And we do have a question from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.", "Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Tom, I just wanted to ask you about the operating margin. If you look at the guidance for fiscal '15, it suggests operating margin somewhere in the range of 16%. And you guys have talked about 15-plus percent. How much of that upside to margins this year is driven by the improvement in the Subsea business? And what do you see as your sort of long-term operating margin at this point through the cycle?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Sure, Sherri. There's going to be a lift on operating margin because it was such a drag with SubCom losing money. But SubCom will be still be, next year, below the company's average operating margin. So you do get some relative improvement, but it's still below the company average. I think the best way to think about operating margins for the company, and now that we really got the operations of the company tuned up and the footprint in good shape, is that if we're growing in this 5% to 6% to 7% range, we don't have unusual movements in metals or exchange rates. You have kind of some natural movements, let's say, that track to inflation. Then, in the 50 basis points per year range, I would expect to growth in that.", "Operator", "And we do have a question from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research.", "Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC", "Just a couple of clarifications. Tom, based on what you've said so far in the call, are you're saying that SubCom lost more money in the quarter because of these program startups, or were you able to reduce the losses quarter-on-quarter? And if you could give us a hint in when it turns profitable again. And just to be clear, what currency rates are you using in your new full year guidance?", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Thanks, Steve. No, SubCom -- SubCom lost a little bit of money in the fourth quarter, less than the third quarter. And we'll start to get a little above breakeven in the first quarter, but it's a really good question to help us clarify. You'll start to see the momentum in SubCom in Q2 and beyond, because that's when the ships are really out there, not fully utilized, but a lot more utilized than we are today, laying the cable. So bottomed in Q3 in terms of profitability, started to see the revenue ramp in Q4, but not a whole lot of profit -- but enough profit with it to substantially help the bottom line and then beginning to get into the black in Q1 and then accelerate past there. So that's the way I think about SubCom. Bob, do you want to talk about FX?", "Robert W. Hau", "Yes, in terms of FX, we're essentially looking at the current FX rate. So call it $1.27 or so to the euro. We project that out for the -- we don't take a position on what's going to happen on currency. So if there's additional fluctuation, good or bad, that could impact the overall business. But of course, we've had a pretty significant decline in, call it, the last 30, 60 days of improvement, strengthening of the U.S. dollar, order of magnitude 7%, 8%. And that is baked into this outlook.", "Sujal Shah", "So there's no further questions, I'll just turn it back to Tom for a couple of closing comments.", "Thomas J. Lynch", "Thanks, Sujal. Thanks, everybody, for joining. Just to reiterate, we really had an excellent year, I think, in 2014. And as much as the financial performance, I feel like it's the execution of our strategy, which is to really build strong performance in for the long, long haul. I feel we're doing that. And I think you can see that, hopefully, in how we're guiding in an uncertain '15 with multiple levers, and importantly, going from 2 segments delivering most of the momentum to now 3 segments in '15, and a good portion of the consumer segment within Appliance. So I feel like we're hitting on most cylinders then. It's exciting because we still have a lot of opportunity and plenty of room to improve. So with that, I hope everybody has a good end of the year as we go into the holiday season, and I'm sure we'll be talking to you soon. Thank you.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 10:30 a.m. today through November 8.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]", "As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Sujal Shah. Please go ahead.", "Sujal Shah", "Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Today we'll be discussing TE Connectivity's first quarter results along with the announcements to sell our Broadband Network Business to CommScope.", "With me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch; and Chief Financial Officer, Bob Hau, who will provide an overview of the transaction, review our first quarter results and guidance and then talk about TE going forward. We will conclude with a Q&A session.", "During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information, and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning and we ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items.", "The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com. Finally, for participants on the Q&A portion of today's call, I would like to remind everyone to limit themselves to one follow-up question to make sure we're able to cover all the questions during the allotted time.", "Now let me turn the call over to Tom for opening comments.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks, Sujal, and good morning to everyone.", "Certainly very exciting time for our company and we have a lot to cover this morning and let me start by covering the transaction we announced earlier this morning. So please turn to Slide 4.", "Earlier this morning, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our BNS business, which consists of TE's Telecommunication Enterprise Networks and Wireless business to CommScope. CommScope is an industry leader and we believe they are the right company to lead our BNS team and business forward.", "Our BNS team has build a successful business and I want to thank them for their contribution, innovation, leadership and commitment to TE over the years and we look forward to working closely with CommScope to close out the transaction.", "Our decision to sell BNS is really a key step in our strategy to continue to focus on strengthening the company's leadership position in the attractive connectivity and sensor market where we provide solutions that are essential for the connected world.", "As you know earlier this year, we made the strategic decision to establish a leadership position in the sensor business. We believe that focus on connectivity and sensors with special emphasis on harsh environment solutions, position TE to provide our customers with an unmatched range of solutions and to further accelerate sales and profit growth.", "When this transaction is complete, 90% of our revenue will be focused on providing connectivity and sensor solutions, which enable our customers to capitalize on the megatrends of safer, greener, smarter and more connected.", "As billions of devices, objects and people become part of the internet of things, TE technology will play an increasingly key role. We have an unmatched range of products to meet these needs and unmatched resources facing the customer, designing and supplying the products.", "Following the close of the transaction, 80% of our revenue will be focused on providing solutions for harsh environment applications, up from 50% several years ago. This has been a major focus of our strategy and I am very pleased with our progress and the results, which we will touch on in more detail when we review the quarter.", "TE has a decade long track record of clear leadership and meeting the demand of connectivity and harsh applications. This is our sweet spot and importantly the transaction will enable us to continue to maintain a very balanced capital allocation strategy.", "We intend to use the bulk of the proceeds from the transaction for share repurchase, while we also continue to aggressively invest organically and inorganically.", "Now please turn to Slide 5 and I'll provide an overview of the transaction. The value of the transaction is $3 billion in cash with the valuation of approximately 10 times adjusted EBITDA. We believe this is an attractive valuation for the business, which generated $1.9 billion of revenue in fiscal 2014.", "We expect the transaction to be neutral to adjusted earnings per share one year after closure when you factor in the use of the proceeds. Our guidance provided this morning includes BNS; however, moving forward BNS will be reported as discontinued operation.", "As I mentioned earlier, the majority of the proceeds of the transaction are expected to be used for share buyback with flexibility to make strategic investment. The Board has authorized an increase to our share buyback authorization by $3 billion making our total share repurchase authorization now approximately $3.7 billion.", "We do expect the transaction to close by the end of calendar 2015 subject to customary closing regulation.", "Now I am going to shift over to the quarter and talk about the highlights in the quarters and now then I'll hand it off to Bob Hau, who will go into the quarter in some detail.", "So Slide 7 provides a summary of our Q1 results. We delivered strong results for Q1 with organic revenue growth in line with expectations and 20% adjusted EPS growth year-over-year. Total company orders were $3.7 billion, up 9%, excluding SubCom, orders were up 4%. Book-to-bill excluding SubCom was 1.03%.", "We continue to execute our strategy to strengthen our leadership position in harsh environment applications with harsh business revenue growth of 10% year-over-year. We continue to grow faster than the market in China in our harsh environment businesses.", "TEOA continues to drive profitability and enhance our margins. Adjusted gross margins were up 100 basis year-over-year and adjusted operating margins expanded to 16%.", "We're really pleased with the performance of Measurement Specialties and AST and have been successful in obtaining new sensor design wins across multiple market segments. I would say these acquisitions have pretty much seamlessly come into our company.", "For fiscal 2015, we're holding our full year adjusted EPS guidance at the midpoint of $4.20 despite a much worsening headwind from FX. We expect continued strong performance from our harsh businesses and the continued recovery of SubCom to offset this FX headwind.", "And then lastly, our Board has recommended an increase in the dividend to $1.32 per share. This is the fifth consecutive year of double-digit increase in the dividend. Our shareholders will vote on this proposal in March and it should go into effect in June.", "With the most recent move of the dollar versus world currencies, our 2015 FX headwinds are now approximately $900 million in revenue and $0.35 in earnings per share versus last year, versus the full year guidance we provided last quarter, we have an incremental impact of $500 million on the revenue line and $0.20 per share.", "Despite this headwind, we're maintaining our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $4.20, which delivers double-digit earnings per share growth. I have to say we feel pretty good about this performance.", "Now I'll turn it over to Bob to cover our segment result's financials and guidance in a little more detail.", "Bob Hau", "Thanks Tom and good morning, everyone.", "I'll start with the transportation on Slide 8, a business which continues to perform exceptionally well and extend our leadership position. In Q1, we grew 8% organically with OEM vehicle production growth of less than 1%. This performance reflects the steady increase in content growth, coupled with our broad based share gains over the last several years.", "Q1 was our first quarter owning Measurement Specialties and the integration momentum of this business is ahead of our expectations. Within the first 90 days, we secured a new integrated sense in connector design win in medical application and our engaged new automotive applications.", "We continue to expect our total sensor business to grow above market due to our unique combination of technology, resources and broad deep customer relationships.", "Total transportation, adjusted operating income was $345 million in Q1, up 16% year-over-year with 80 basis points expansion in adjusted operating margins due to volume growth, favorable mix and strong productivity execution. Looking forward, we expect another good quarter in Q2 with actual sales growth up mid single digits.", "Please turn to Slide 9. Our Industrial Solutions segment performed well in Q2 with 3% actual and organic sales growth, representing the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for this segment.", "Industrial equipment was flat organically with growth in China offset by market softness in Europe and Japan. In Aerospace, Defense, Oil, and Gas, we saw 8% organic growth, driven by continued strength in commercial aerospace.", "We received many questions about revenue risk from falling oil prices and our exposure is actually quite limited. As a result, we would expect continued strength in commercial aerospace to more than offset slight weakness in our oil and gas business.", "In our energy business, we saw 1% organic growth with gains in Americas, offsetting market softness in Europe and China. Adjusted operating income was $101 million in Q1, up 1% versus the prior year and we continue to invest in footprint optimization and go-to-market resources to accelerate profitable growth.", "For Q2 we expect to grow low single digits with mid single digit growth organically.", "Turning to Slide 10, our Network segment grew 2% year-over-year on an organic basis, driven by growth in our SubCom business as a result of projects that are ramping ahead of schedule. We're increasing our revenue outlook for SubCom to approximately $650 million for fiscal 2015 and expect our three large projects, which recently came into force to contribute over $900 million over the next two to three years.", "Our Broadband and DataComm businesses declined versus the prior year impacted by regional declines and project delays. In Q2, we expect total network solutions revenue growth in the high teens organically, driven by SubCom with Broadband and DataComm up slightly organically.", "If you turn to Slide 11, I'll discuss our Consumer Solutions segment. In consumer devices, we continue to narrow our focus in order to improve profitability, while continuing to invest in technologies that are important to the company as a whole such as miniaturization, antennas and wearable enablers.", "Today we're announcing plans to combine our Consumer Devices and DataComm business units. The customers we serve in these businesses are converging and much of the underlying technology and products are quite similar. This is the next key step to accelerate the performance in these businesses, which are core to our connectivity portfolio.", "Please turn to Slide 12, where I'll provide more details and earnings. Adjusted operating income was $555 million, up 14% versus the prior year. The growth versus the prior year is driven by improved manufacturing productivity across the company and volume leverage.", "GAAP operating income was $477 million and included $27 million of restructuring and other charges, most of which were in the Consumer Solutions segment and $51 million of acquisition related charges in the quarter as expected.", "Adjusted EPS was $0.98 for the quarter above the high end of guidance, driven by strong productivity, mix and cost management. GAAP EPS was $1.14 for the quarter and GAAP EPS included acquisition related charges of $0.09, restructuring and other charges of $0.06 and income related to tax items of $0.31.", "The tax item primarily stems from the effective settlement of essentially all pre-separation tax matters with the exception of the inner company debt issue. We're currently scheduled for litigation in February of 2016 if no settlement can be reached prior to that time.", "For the full year 2015, I continue to expect approximately $50 million to $75 million of restructuring and other charges and reflecting $0.10 at midpoint of our guidance, up slightly versus last year.", "We expect roughly $0.22 of charges associated with recent acquisitions, which we more than offset by gains from the settlement of tax liabilities.", "Turning to Slide 13, I'll discuss the financial metrics that are tied to the TE operating advantage or TEOA. Our adjusted gross income in the quarter was 34.6%. This is an expansion of 100 basis points versus the prior year, driven primarily by productivity gains from TEOA initiatives and leverage on additional volume.", "Adjusted operating margins expanded 140 basis points, driven by productivity and operating expense leverage. Total operating expenses were $643 million in the quarter with SG&A decreasing versus the prior year and R&D increasing to $184 million, mostly from acquisitions and the support growth primarily in transportation.", "Total operating expenses were 18.6% of sales, down 40 basis points from the prior year. Cash from continuing operations was $295 million and our free cash flow in Q1 was $162 million. Free cash flow was impacted by the timing of tax payments and SubCom project activity.", "Gross capital expenditures were up slightly year-over-year and net capital expenditures were up $16 million versus the prior year. I expect capital spending rate to be approximately 5% of sales for 2015. I note we added a balance sheet and cash flow summary in the appendix of this slide for additional details.", "Now I'll turn it back to Tom/", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks Bob. Please turn to Slide 14 and I'll cover our outlook at a high level with additional details provided in the slide.", "We expect to deliver another solid quarter in Q2 with revenue of $3.55 billion to $3.6 billion, up 3% to 6% year-over-year and in line with our normal seasonal patterns. We expect adjusted earnings per share of $0.98 to $1.02, an increase of 3% to 7% year-over-year.", "Our Q2 outlook does include a headwind from currency exchange rates which are negatively affecting our guidance by approximately $250 million in revenue and $0.10 per share versus the prior quarter, I am sorry, versus the prior year.", "Our second quarter performance will be driven by the continued strong performance of our harsh environment businesses, the building momentum in SubCom and contributions from our sensor and oil and gas acquisition. This is more than offsetting the significant FX headwind.", "Now if you'll turn to Slide 15, for the full year, we expect to deliver another year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth, despite these strong FX headwinds. We have a number of catalysts for growth. The strong secular trend is increasing electronic content, especially in harsh applications, our expansion into the high growth sensor market and the recovering SubCom business.", "For the full year, we now expect revenue of $14.45 billion to $14.85 billion, up 5% versus the prior year and this reflects 6% organic growth. And note that the total impact of currency exchange rates is approximately $900 million versus the prior year.", "Our new revenue guidance represents $150 million of incremental organic growth versus our October view with increases in transportation and industrial appliance and SubCom. And as I mentioned earlier we're maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $4.05 to $4.35 per share, representing year-over-year growth of 11% at the midpoint.", "Just for clarity, compared to our prior guidance last quarter, this represents a $0.20 operational improvement offsetting a $0.20 headwind from that foreign exchange.", "To provide a baseline for the performance of our business organically, adjusted EPS would have grown in the neighborhood or 20% year-over-year and constant currencies and for one for the negative impact of a $1. But the good news is we're offsetting this with strong performance in the business.", "I am now going to spend a few minutes talking about how we think about TE going forward post the BNS sale, so please turn to Slide 17. In the nine years I've been here, I've never felt better about the opportunities facing the company and our ability to seize them.", "These mega trends of safe green, smart and connected represent a market opportunity of approximately $165 billion for connectivity and sensor solution and we are the leading provider of these solutions.", "These markets are expected to grow at roughly 2X GDP over the long term driven by this increase in electronic content in virtually every industry.", "Please turn to Slide 18 and I'll give you a few examples of the accelerating content story. In the automotive market, we're capitalizing on our leadership in connectivity to become a leader in sensors and our customers are very excited about the combination.", "This combination of connectors and sensors represents a potential of approximately $400 of content for the average vehicle. Today we're the clear leader with content of slightly above $60 per vehicle. So there is a lot of opportunity and we're investing in the resources to capture more of it.", "In the commercial aerospace market, there is going to be about 37,000 new planes expected to be delivered over the next 20 years and all have a significant increase in electronic content.", "On top of that, TE content is increasing pretty significantly and in almost every platform as a result of the increased organic investments over the last several years, coupled with the very strategic Deutsche acquisition, which is going very well.", "Our customers increasingly see us as a solutions provider, which is driving up our content per design opportunity that's very exciting. We're getting to do things we hadn\u2019t had the opportunity to do a few years ago. And in some cases, where we bring a broader solution, we can actually see our content go up eight to 10 times over prior model.", "In the industrial equipment market, electronic content is also increasing due to a variety of reasons, but you can see the big increases in factory automations, robotics and the smart factory we see it all over the world and all of these require more sensors and more connectivity and we are very well positioned with these product lines.", "Please turn to Slide 19, as you know, the core of our strategy over the past several years has been to strengthen our leadership and harsh environment application. Post the BNS transaction, this will represent approximately 80% of our business.", "Harsh environments demand excellent, engineering and manufacturing and the typical application we're involved very early with our customers in the design phase and they're increasingly relying on us to provide the products, sensor pass more signal, operate in higher power environments and take less space and weight.", "This is our specialty and what we see increasing system knowledge in these applications is very important and that is the strength of ours. These solutions typically have a lot of stickiness because the cost of change is high and our customers rely on the value we provide and continue to ask us to do more.", "We are having a very positive reaction as I said earlier to the expansion of our sensor capabilities because that gives us more options to meet customer needs and these are customers that are typically looking to reduce the numbers of suppliers in order to get more strategic suppliers and simplify their own supply chain.", "In the harsh environment markets, we've been steadily increasing inorganic and organic investments. We've expanded engineering and field resources at a faster rate and sales growth over the past several years and our performance in TEOA is consistently driving up quality performance and our margin performance.", "Please turn to Slide 20 and I'll wrap things up before we go to Q&A. So really the summary of today is going forward TE will be more focused than ever on what we do best. 90% of our portfolio will be focused on sensors and connectors and almost 80% will be in harsh environment application.", "We have the broadest and deepest censoring connectivity solutions on the market and we will continue to strengthen this portfolio to be our customer's best choice. We also feel this portfolio will enable us to accelerate our sales and profit growth and continue to make TE a top choice for investors.", "So with that, let's open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Amit Daryanani", "Thanks and congrats on a nice guide and asset sale guys. Maybe to start with the fiscal '15 guide, I am just curious how do you think commodities are playing out in the guide? My math is that it's a $0.08, $0.09 benefit for you guys, but I think your hedges could delay this.", "So curious how commodities are playing out and any updated thoughts on potential looking to start hedging FX as we go forward given how severe the impact has been for you guys?", "Tom Lynch", "Hi Amit, thanks. I would say we're definitely seeing commodity cost come down as you know. With copper, our strategy has always been to hedge that to mach cost with price and the timing of the cycles out there.", "So in particular, the big decline in copper prices that's happened recently will start to flow into us late in the year, which should provide a nice tailwind going into early next year.", "Bob, you want to talk about\u2026", "Bob Hau", "Yes, so first starting from an impact, you're right. You're a little bit heavy given the timing of the hedges and how those play out around the metals, copper, gold and silver. It's probably $0.05, $0.06 benefit to 2015 and of course if metals continue where they're at, it will be a nice tailwind for us into 2016.", "In terms of currency, as you know we are largely naturally hedged from a transactional standpoint. We have factories around the globe and we build locally for our local customers and so from a transactional standpoint, we don't have much exposure and where we do, we actually do hedge the remaining exposure.", "From a translational standpoint, which is the impact that Tom talked about in his opening remarks, we do not hedge and I think you'll find a vast majority of the companies that have foreign currency exposure on a translational standpoint, don't hedge those currencies that would be taking a bet on where those currencies will be going and I don't want to take that bet.", "Amit Daryanani", "Fair enough. And then I was wondering if you could just may be touch on the Transportation Solutions business, that you guys had really impressive I think organic growth in the December quarter, your order book looks like it remains fairly robust.", "The auto production environment I think has been fairly stable over the last 90 days, so I am curious, do you think content growth broadly is starting to pick up from the 5%, 6% threshold that you have in the past of do you guys think you see more market share wins, what's driving the strength on the transportation organic growth basis?", "Tom Lynch", "Content is drifting up, but the big thing in this time period is the share we won three and four years ago. It's the design ins, particularly that we won coming out of the crises when we kept investing in engineering and our auto business across the world.", "And in two areas that we got -- that we weren\u2019t leaders, but we were the leader in the U.S., but with tremendous opportunity in China we made significant investments in those regions. We always had a large investment in Europe and it's really paid off.", "So I would say more than anything it's the design ins that we won that take a few years to come to pass. We do see content continuing to drift up I don't think it's at the outside. It's probably that 4% to 6% range might be 4.5% to 6%, 4.5% to 6.5%, but a lot depends on in there mix and stuff like that, but for us it's been -- it's been more of the design wins of recent years.", "Sujal Shah", "Okay. Thank you, Amit. Can we have the next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Amitabh Passi from UBS. Please go ahead.", "Amitabh Passi", "Hi guys. Thank you. And congrats again from my end. I guess Tom, my first question for us is how are you thinking about the rest of the portfolio, particularly if we look at some of the underperforming segments and at your networks DataComm, consumer solutions, maybe if you can just give us an update in terms of the rest of the portfolio?", "Tom Lynch", "As Bob mentioned on DataComm and consumer, we actually decided to and we're announcing that real time that we're putting those businesses together into one business. The customers are all becoming the same. There was always customer overlap and now it's converging more and more especially in China.", "The technology particularly the core connectivity technology that goes inside a box is very similar. So we see a much -- more opportunity to leverage that and this is going to help our scale and cost effectiveness, which we need to drive the profitability up.", "So that's the plan there and I think it's important that people understand that DataComm and consumer are very, very core to the business. I view them as core as automotive because it's another range of products.", "If you think of a company like ours, our specialty is connecting and we're building specialty in censors and those applications at knowledge, they go into a variety of different applications that happen to be stronger in some than others, but the core technology, the core science, the physics, the manufacturing practices, the supply chain, they're all very similar, they're all practically identical.", "So those are core businesses and the strategy really is to be more selective because the profit pools have changed a lot more in consumer and DataComm than they had in the long cycle industrial, transportation type businesses.", "With respect to energy; energy, I've used a very good solid business for us. It's been a little less of expectation for the last couple of years because it's Europe more than anything else, we're growing ahead of market in the U.S. we have a nice niche, a strong niche position because we're selective in China, but we expect as the energy grid has to be upgraded in Europe, that we're well positioned and it's a very focused well run business.", "Amitabh Passi", "Excellent, and then just as a follow-up Bob, on industrial\u2026", "Excellent. And then, just as a follow-up, Bob. On industrial solutions can you may be remind us again what needs to occur to structurally drive margins potentially into the mid to upper-teens? And then may be just related, can you just clarify what the gross margin was for BNS?", "Bob Hau", "From industrial solutions standpoint, we've seen some nice margin lift in that business over the last couple of years. We've now got six consecutive quarters of growth. So we're seeing some volume leverage that will flow through.", "As I mentioned, in the current quarter we're down just slightly on a year-over-year basis, really driven by some investments we're making in footprint optimization moving some product around to get it in the right factories, as well as some investments in go-to-market resources.", "Our sales folks, product people that support our customers, as they develop their next generation products to make sure we're there with them. Both of those actions will continue to drive cost out to the footprint optimization as well as top line revenue growth. So the 13% slightly below company average right now, but we'll see that continue to expand in later part of this year and obviously into the future.", "Tom Lynch", "And what I'd add to that is that in our aerospace business is well above company average. And our industrial equipment business right at may be slightly below company average, but we expect it to be at or above company average in the next two quarters.", "And it's the energy business which is more -- it's just really suffering from a very slow market right now that has pulled that down. But I'm pretty confident that with a slight uptick in sales, I mean when we're at 1% you don't get much operating leverage and the team has done a good job of holding their margin there.", "But that will pick up. I mean it's only going to probably be at 3% to 4% grower, but when that happens we have a lot of operating leverage in that business. So, as we've said before, we view this business, we expect this business to be kind of a high-teens operating margin business and that's the moves we're making to ensure we get there.", "Bob Hau", "And in terms of BNS, we don't provide operating margin by segment, but we have said in the past and continue to be public with operating margin for broadband networks business is slightly above company average nicely into the double-digit level.", "Amitabh Passi", "Gross margin, right?", "Bob Hau", "It's operating margin.", "Amitabh Passi", "Okay.", "Sujal Shah", "All right. Thank you, Amitabh. Could we have next question, please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood from Macquarie. Please go ahead.", "Mike Wood", "Hi. Congratulations. First question just on the upside that you called out in the quarter of Measurement Specialties, is that coming from end market growth or has there been any tweaks that you've put into the business so far.", "Tom Lynch", "Hi Mike. Thanks, by the way. I would say it's mostly the market right now. We haven't had a chance to let's say impact sales growth with most of our focus has been on the integration as to fully understand what we have so we can help set the priorities. Our biggest challenge which is a great challenge is more opportunities than we can deal with, so that's a big priority.", "But getting out of the gate then leading the numbers they had signed up for Measurement was important. Our own internal sensor business continuing to be strong and just continuing to ride on that back of a very robust market, which is exciting -- which as exciting, maybe more exciting to me because it gets to the strategic part of it.", "Now the reason we did it is we're seeing -- we're getting in a lot more request for proposals participating and having customers ask us to bid in some of these harsh businesses, the customers that we knew, but now bidding the MEAS technology. That doesn\u2019t result in revenue for few years, as you know, but we're happy to see that this is happening quickly.", "And that's really the theory of why we did this in the power of the combination that our go-to-market resources and global supply chain with MEAS' very broad and deep engineering team and technology pipeline. And we're seeing it. We're only one quarter into it. One quarter obviously doesn't make a gain, but it's what we've seen in them some, so very pleased that it at least getting off to a good start.", "Mike Wood", "Great. And for my follow-up, and I understand if you can't provide detail on this, but given your new focus which is primarily on harsh, these critical use applications typically carry high margin. So do you have a longer term margin goal for the company given this new focus, or also just a new benchmarking peer set that you're measuring your performance on?", "Tom Lynch", "I'd say the way to think about it, Mike, is no, we have not set like we did years ago, the 15% margin goal. When we set that we felt that was really critical to prove that the company had reached the point of strong operating capability. Now, its drive a growth of 5% to 7% consistently, organic growth and we would expect to drive 50 basis point plus margin growth.", "Of course, all of our businesses have aggressive targets for sales growth and margin growth with TEOA. It's how we decide what parts of the portfolio to go after. But we have not set a new sort of external margin threshold that we want to reach. Will we? May be.", "We want to get through the divestiture of BNS and the integration of MEAS. But I think generally, if you listen to us we think we can maintain and continue to drive strong transportation margins. We think there's room in industrial margins. The BNS margin will be a net sale accretive to the company. And we have pretty much all upside in the consumer device margin and the DataComm margin because they are low.", "So there's a lot of margin drivers in the company. And I think you see it in Q1 where we hit, and we had some nice mix in Q1 for sure. So maybe we got a few -- 20 or 30 basis points more than the typical, but we're knocking on the door of 16 and we feel good about that.", "Mike Wood", "Great. Thanks.", "Sujal Shah", "All right. Thank you, Mike. Could we have the next question, please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citi. Please go ahead. Jim Suva, your line is open. Okay. We'll move on. We'll go to your next question. That question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Please go ahead.", "Matt Sheerin", "Yes. Thanks and good morning. Just another question regarding the sale of the networking business. It looks like a portion of the DataComm business has been carved out within the sale to CommScope. Is that the wireless part? And could you tell us what the run rate of your DataComm business is now.", "Tom Lynch", "None of the DataComm business has carved out. We -- wireless, to your point, is a broad term. So when we talk about wireless in our networks business, we're talking about distributed antenna systems, but any of the wireless product that DataComm has, has stayed with data comm.", "Matt Sheerin", "Okay. So you're keeping that. Okay. And, could\u2026", "Tom Lynch", "What is in BNS today.", "Matt Sheerin", "Got you. And just regarding the Measurement Specialties, I know the sensor business is sitting within your transportation business, but Measurement also sells into industrial and consumer markets. Will that business also be working with your other segments in terms of cross-selling and sales opportunities, or will these running on a standalone basis?", "Tom Lynch", "Now from the day one that\u2019s we did. And that's one of the things I'm most pleased about that in all of our relevant businesses, most relevant businesses where we want to broaden the sensor opportunity quickly, lot of activity in automotive, lot of activity in industrial transportation, lot of activity in medical, significant activity in aerospace even though that's much longer cycle.", "To be able to bring sensor solution to the table to a big customer it enhances your standing with that customer, and significant activity in the appliance business.", "So we've already mapped the people in the -- our traditional businesses into the sensor business with some ground rules that we don't overwhelm the new sensor team. But I am very pleased with the collaboration and the sensibility that everybody is using in how to pursue opportunities but not get out ahead of our headlights. And we've got a couple of design in already which frankly happened sooner than I thought.", "Bob Hau", "Matt, that's one the reasons you may have noticed in our Transportation Solutions slide in the presentation. We are now reporting three different business units within the Transportation Solutions segment; automotive, commercial transport and sensors to provide the visibility into the sensor business that is, as you point out, more than an automotive.", "Matt Sheerin", "Got it. Okay. Thanks very much.", "Bob Hau", "Yeah.", "Sujal Shah", "All right. Thank you, Matt. Could we have the next question, please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fox from Cross Research. Please go ahead.", "Steven Fox", "Thank you. Good morning. Just on the transaction, first of all, in terms of use of proceeds, I understand where investing in your stock could be a good way to neutralize EPS dilution, but can you just sort of give us a sense of where you stand versus pursuing other acquisitions and may be could be even more accretive use of funds.", "Tom Lynch", "First, Steve thanks. We have a pretty robust pipeline, as we've talked about before. That pipeline is very focused on harsh. And as always in these situations, you never know how and when things are going to break free.", "So, we have priorities, how they would fit. And I think the nice thing is that as we showed last year, we could make significant moves like SEACON measurement in AST, significant investments in acquisitions and continue to have a very balanced return of capital in form of dividend increases and share repurchase. We will -- to us that's kind of an ideal year, may be not spent $2 billion in capital every year, but if the right opportunity was there, we will seize it if it's doable.", "So we clearly view what's the strong operational performance we have now and there's still room for improvement that putting more on the top line is the top priority. We see our customers wanting us to do more because disability to integrate and package that we're very good at and we already do an automotive and industrial transportation and aerospace and defense and are starting to do an industrial really helps the customer.", "So this idea of a broad range of connectivity and sensors is very potent from the customers' point of view. So we're always looking to add into that. So I would -- you would expect to see us continuing to do a nice mix of M&A and capital returns.", "Steven Fox", "Great. And then just to clarify a couple of comments, Tom, in terms of the Measurement Specialties business. You're saying that the revenues reported today are all basically from the company's acquired book of business.", "But that you -- the teams have already gotten together, and I've pulled some sales synergies that we should start seeing over the next few quarters. And if you could talk about what that little hanging fruit sort of revolves around. Thanks.", "Tom Lynch", "As we've pointed out when we made the acquisitions, Steve, the sales -- the design in sale synergies like any design in sale synergies take a while, so that's kind of year two, year three. The short-term sale synergies are more out of two paths. One, we have more people selling to all these customers, so can we sell more existing solutions to a customer just because we're in front of more customers. So we expect to start to see some of that towards the end of the year.", "And what in the products that can go through the channel. So our channel team, its lead by John Wainwright is working with our channel partners to identify what are the practical products that can be sold through the channel. And we view that as the shortest term revenue synergy.", "But the longer ones are when we see that we can integrate a sensor into a wire and a certain application, whether it'd be an industrial or medical or whatever that takes a few years to turn into revenue, all consistent with our acquisition plan.", "Steven Fox", "Great. That's very helpful. Congratulations on the transaction.", "Sujal Shah", "Thank you, Steve. Could we have next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Shawn Harrison from Longbow Research. Please go ahead.", "Shawn Harrison", "Hi. Good morning and congratulations on the results. I just wanted to dig in on two things in terms of the broadband networks business being sold and also the buyback.", "It looks like maybe the accretion this year from that business would have been or the earnings contribution -- excuse me-- would have been around $0.40 to $0.45 meaning that you pick up at least 50 basis points of margin consolidated once the business is sold. But maybe why not accelerate the buyback earlier? You guys don't have significant leverage to even fill that gap earlier than let's say 18 to 24 months out.", "Tom Lynch", "Yeah. Shawn, thanks for the question. In terms of their profitability, we're little bit higher than what you've suggested, but order of magnitude that's about right. In terms of the share buyback, as we noted in our opening comments, we anticipate the deal to close by the end of the calendar year, and so that $3 billion of cash isn't available until the deal closes at the end of the year.", "It doesn't mean -- we are already and will continue to be active in our ongoing share buyback program. We bought back this most recently completed quarter and we'll continue to do that as part of our return to capital program. But the $3 billion when that becomes available we'll increase that activity.", "Shawn Harrison", "Okay. And then there's a follow-up, with the combination of DataComm and consumer devices, EBIT margin is probably best case scenario right now or maybe mid-single-digits other than revenue synergies. How do you see the margins for that business long-term? Can it be add a mid-teens EBIT margins and what steps need to be taken other than just bring yourselves of low margin business to get there.", "Tom Lynch", "Sure. And again, you've got peal back the onion a little bit. So, if you look at in both businesses, the core connector businesses, the EBIT margin is well above that. In DataComm we have been investing in high-speed solutions and those product lines, if you have measured them and as we do product line profitability, they are losing money because they are in investment stage and the designing is just starting.", "So the core business where we miniaturize connectors, go into server, storage, smartphones, pretty decent business, not as high operating margin as industrial or industrial transportation that's there.", "Then its can we be successful with these R&D initiatives we have what I call. I mean they're not pure R&D because we're selling the products, but they just haven't been adapted across the industries yet. And so that's really the question. How long will we pursue those?", "We really believe in this insatiable data world that for datacenters and for other applications in our company, high speed, more than five, 10, 12 gigabit is going to be necessary. So we're developing fiber connectivity and copper connectivity for 25 gig plus. Those are strategic investments that happen to reside in the DataComm business.", "And then we're looking at some other advanced technologies that are most naturally in the consumer business because that's where you get the initial application that may not be the most where we get the bang for the buck eventually.", "Certain type of manufacturing that we're applying there because the miniaturization that's where the trend starts there. And by the way, over the years we have seen the ability to miniaturize their move quickly into our automotive business where it's been more and more important over the last five years.", "So it's not -- the good news is it's not just that's you've got to cost reduce this thing. And if you keep cost reducing it, you make it an uncompetitive business. No, two-thirds of our business is solid and can get better, no questions.", "That's the core connector business and one-third are investments we're making, and we have milestones that we hold ourselves to that are proof points that either yes we have the right technology, or the market is taking the technology. And when we see those not happen, and I'll give you good example of a product line Magnetic that we divested last year, that was one of those.", "We felt like we had a better way to solve the Magnetic's issues and it turned out we didn't so we divested it. So that's how I think about those businesses. But they are very core-wise, they are core connectivity businesses. And how big they'll be in the portfolio is to be determined, but they will be in the portfolio.", "Shawn Harrison", "Right. And just quickly, Tom. I'm sorry. The follow-up on the 25, 40 gig move. In the last time on the call you thought may be toward the end of the year you would see some greater adoption. Do you still view that as potential dynamic exiting the fiscal year?", "Tom Lynch", "I do. It's not going to be big in the numbers because it takes time. But the good news is we won contracts. The program management is starting to plan the installation and all good signs. But the rate of winning needs to increase for this to look like it is the business we thought it would be.", "We're not surprised it's kind of tracking to what we thought when we had a reset. And the industry, with all the change it went through, began to embrace these kind of things a little slower. But all the customers are saying they need to get there. It's just the rate at which they're going to get there.", "Shawn Harrison", "Thanks so much, and congrats again.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks.", "Sujal Shah", "Thank you, Shawn. Could we have next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Craig Hettenbach", "Yes. Thanks so much. Quite a ride, Tom, in terms of I think of since the split from Tyco, a lot of portfolio management, arguably much for the better at this point. So with that I'd love to get your thoughts in terms of oppose the latest sale, what that means in terms of that, the clarity of the strategy, the organization and as you execute to the harsh environment going forward.", "Tom Lynch", "Sure. From the strategy that we've had inside the company, has been pretty darn that we've had a strategy map that I think we modify a little bit every couple of years, but it's been fundamentally consistent around connectivity.", "We got more granular when we acquired Deutsche around; become much more aggressive around harsh connectivity and what that meant was acquire. We were moving at a nice pace and we always had a strong harsh business. But then in a sense took the double down approach and we are fortunate Deutsche came on the market and we got it.", "We were incubating the sensor business to see is that a place that we should go into or not. We didn't know. And we had some doubts. But when we kind of broke through a few years ago, then we decided logical place for us to be, not only because sensor is a good business and the skills we have are similar no exact, but the skills you need to be successful on sensors, but more importantly, because we see the conversions in the solutions.", "And so, then -- as that moved from let's see if we want to be in sensors too, this needs to be a new platform for the company, that changed the focus on networks. That made networks an important part of the business, but not as critical.", "And we also concluded that in that time to really have the kind of business in broadband networks that we have in harsh or could have in sensors, we needed to augment the product line pretty significantly a much broader wireless capability, which is not really something we could develop organically.", "And that was going to be a bit of a challenge. And then, we weighed that against other opportunities. We decided we're going to have to optimize that business another way. Now we were fortunate enough to find a very strategic buyer.", "Because, you may have a business you -- optimization may not mean selling because you're not going to get the value for it. But we got a very strategic buyer, perfect set. So we could get more value than we could by running it ourselves or spending it out or something like that. So I think our patience of pursuing an optimal solution in this case paid off.", "So now you get to the point where 90% connectors and sensors, 80% harsh. A pretty consistent strategy, the manufacturing methods are the same pretty much in these businesses. How you go to market are very similar, the applications are slightly different.", "The sharing of technology, you're sharing it across 90% of the business now. And it's very exciting, especially at a time when customers are asking us to come in earlier in the architecture. And that's why the solutions we're bringing in many cases today they're not sell support solutions.", "There really are how do we optimize higher power, higher-speed and a smaller footprint on this manifold in this vehicle platform, what else can you do for us here? So that's pretty exciting to us because it starts to open up other new paths for growing the business. And we don't want to -- we want to completely focus around that.", "Craig Hettenbach", "Got it. Thanks for that. As a follow-up on MEAS and sensors specifically, when we talk about growing that above market, can you give any context in terms of are there certain niches where they play where they are very strong that are growing faster than the market relative to utilizing your larger sales force and distribution channel that should drive growth too. Can you give any context in terms of how that shapes out?", "Tom Lynch", "Yeah. The business grew up with a very customer-focus which is good, but not so much an industry-focus. So going in when a customer here or there and really do well with that customer because in the smaller company you often say that catch 22 well, where do I get the resources. I don't want to get out ahead of my headlights.", "So we're bringing them into more; for example, appliance customers than they were in before. We're bringing them into more medical customers than they were in before. They weren't in automotive customers and we're bringing them in there.", "And in industrial transportation where they have a very nice business, the combination of their sensor business and our connector business it's very attractive to our customers. So that's how I really think about it if I hit your question.", "Craig Hettenbach", "It does. Thanks.", "Tom Lynch", "Welcome.", "Sujal Shah", "All right. Thank you, Craig. Could we have next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Wamsi Mohan", "Yes. Thank you, good morning. Tom, you commented about -- commented on lower energy prices as it pertains to the oil and gas portfolio. But I was wondering are you seeing any trends of change in purchasing behavior from a demand standpoint in the transportation business given where gas prices are, and I have a follow-up for Bob.", "Tom Lynch", "I would say that our customers, Wamsi, anticipate some of that. But it's probably still too early. When we talk to them, they will tell us that is a typical trend. Gas prices go down in the U.S. with the improving economy, trucks go up, we like that. We have a lot of content on trucks. But I think it's too early to say that we're seeing the trends yet; although, the mix of content, as I alluded to earlier, is still moving in a strong direction.", "Wamsi Mohan", "Right.", "Tom Lynch", "But if prices stay low that that will help demand.", "Wamsi Mohan", "Okay. Great. Thanks. And Bob, can you talk a little bit about any synergies that might come from this divestiture, particularly because of maybe shared facility usage or overhead absorption? And what sort of things you intend to do operationally to offset some of that? And do you anticipate anything like site consolidation, et cetera? Thanks.", "Bob Hau", "For the most part, from a factory standpoint, our BNS business had standalone facilities. So, those facilities will transact with the field. So we don't have a lot of work from a standpoint of factory remaining of X% for or having to find a way to manufacture something that is in a facility that is going, relatively segregated, so not a lot of work and worry there.", "There are, of course, some shared services activities, some corporate functions. We've got a year before the deal closes; and of course, we have a transaction services agreement post deal closure. So we got some time to work through those issues. We don't anticipate it to be an issue one way or another.", "Wamsi Mohan", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Sujal Shah", "All right, Wamsi. Could we have the next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Mark Delaney", "Yes. Good morning, and thanks very much for taking the questions. I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on some of your prior comments about potentially looking to make some additional investments with the proceeds from the BNS sale. I know you talked about some of the product lines and you are excited to be an IOT-type focus company now with industrial and automotive.", "But maybe you could just touch on to how you are thinking about your end market diversification going forward? And just as you exit BNS, the exposure to auto and industrial would go up, and just if you could talk about your comfort levels with exposure to those markets. And as you're thinking about making investments, do want to try and increase your exposure into other areas?", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks Mark. So in terms of the first part of the question, increasing organic investments, we have seen over the last five years is pretty good correlation, particularly in the harsh businesses, which are strong suit that when we invest and increase the number of engineers and field engineers, field engineers in our industrial business because there's lots of customers in fragmented market and design engineers. And then in our more OEM kid of business like commercial air, automotive, industrial transportation, design engineers.", "So wherever we have the opportunity to put -- find the right design engineers, put them close to the customer, we take it. It's kind of an open-ended charge to go get those folks because there is such a correlation.", "And the more that we can be sitting with the customer and the architecture, the better job we can do for them and the more business we get. And you can see it best in the rate of growth in our commercial air businesses and our automotive and industrial transportation businesses.", "More recently, we've been applying that to our industrial equipment business and our appliance business, high margin, high market share businesses where co-design and because we have a lot of systems knowledge, we can really help the customer to design their products, the insides of their products, the electrical system or the electronic systems function, much more effective.", "So we make those investments were the customers are receptive to them and where we can get the engineers and the right engineers. It's much less about if are we going to hold off on investing in automotive until we bring industrial up, no. And the reason is because of the content growth.", "Automotive grew 4.5%, vehicle production last year projected somewhere around 2.5% this year. We're still going to be mid to high single digits growth because of the designing wins we had and the vehicle content growth.", "So, this content growth is probably as good and it's consistent as it's ever been at least in the nine years I've been here. So it provides an element of growth that, while the business itself might cycle, this should be a good business for us in most cycles.", "On top of that, if you look at what our margins were five or six years ago, they are dramatically improved, because we've become much more effective at what we do and how we design. And by the way, our customers share in that improvement.", "And even with that, the margins are up. So that, when the cycle maybe goes into a down cycle, our wherewithal is so much stronger. So now I don't look at it from hey I wouldn't want to get a bunch of new design wins or acquire some technology that is relevant to us. If it's automotive because it makes us bigger because I just think the underlying trend is so positive there.", "But it's clear that when we look across the portfolio, sensors in general and the industrial markets we serve in particular are very, very high priorities for M&A. It plays through our strong suite. We've been making smaller acquisitions there to in some cases give us a portfolio like SEACON or broaden our portfolio like this company Sibas that we acquired in China in the last few months.", "Not a big company, but a significant product line we didn't have that they only sold in China that will now take around the world. So, you will continue to see us make small technology acquisitions so that the solution strategy we can bring more and more to the customer.", "And it's all relevant. It all has to do with collectivity or sensors. All right, does that carry your question?", "Mark Delaney", "Yes, that's very helpful. And then, for a follow-up, just on the SG&A, the dollars came down sequentially and I think the SG&A as a percentage of sales was at one of lowest levels in several years.", "Maybe first just how much of that was some of the TEOA initiatives versus just FX causing SG&A to come down? And then maybe you can help us think about what the SG&A levels will run at going forward.", "Tom Lynch", "Mark, from a standpoint of the benefit, year-over-year, we've done about 40 basis points. There are certainly benefit in both areas of TEOA. As you know, last year, we expanded TEOA from what had been a factory productivity and a lean product development process in our DNE organization to really be as we call it TEOA everywhere in our G&A functions are now seeing the benefit of that.", "There's also definitely some tailwind from an FX standpoint. So it's a combination of both. And, as we continue to see organic growth, we'd expect that percent of sales to generate some leverage throughout the course of the year.", "Bob Hau", "But just add to that, the area that we've been consistently investing in and happens to show up in this line, but it's really the digital effort to accelerate the digitization of the company better website, better product information, things like that.", "So that's going to continue. We view that as essential to our value proposition. And so, we're not -- there are some areas we're not investing and we feel we're adequate in the back office. That's not an area. That's a strategic area that we're investing in the S portion of G&A.", "And, we're not shy about putting field resources in the field, particularly in harsh environments where the solutions are more complex and the ability to help the customer through the design, from a field, applications, engineering perspective, it's important.", "And then thirdly, we're going to be investing in field resources and sensors. We've started to take advantage of all of these opportunities. And they are growers. So, the multiplier to growth is very positive. It takes a few years. But I think with our margin improvement and the leverage across the balance of our SG&A that sums it out adequately and continues to put a lot of fuel into the growth pipeline.", "Sujal Shah", "Thank you, Mark. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of William Stein from SunTrust. Please go ahead.", "William Stein", "Great. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a very strong operational outlook. First I am hoping to get a clarification. When asked about margins, I think you said you wouldn't disclose gross margin.", "But operating margin on BNS was above company average, nicely double-digit that's surprising to me. Did I hear that right?", "Bob Hau", "Yes. I believe I said and should have said it is slightly below company average. ", "William Stein", "Got it. Okay. And then my kind of real question I guess is actually about SubCom. We spent a lot of time today talking about kind of what's core and in particular talking about harsh and then other things that you came to decide wanted course that you're divesting.", "This is an area that certainly I think sits in the category of harsh, but you've also talked about it as in a way, very different and potentially not core to the company, but of course, it's difficult to find a buyer.", "We're seeing your only real competitor I think in this space Alcatel-Lucent, looking like they're to IPO this business. Understanding that the timing might not be right given the toughing position of that revenue. Is there something you could consider?", "Tom Lynch", "We could yes. Are we? No. We've looked at this many times. The most important thing about the business is they're the best in the world at what they do. So, when you start out with that, at least my philosophy is you got to be careful that you don't run away from a business too fast.", "And given the uniqueness of the business, it really is worth more inside the portfolio that the out. Sure there is a lot of people would love it but I know they either don't have the wherewithal to pay.", "If you contrasted to BNS, BNS is another good business. We weren\u2019t sitting here with our finger on the red button, let's get rid of this thing was a strategic decision that it's not going to get as much priority as it did before sensors. It still can be a very good business.", "We think there is a good cycle or a solid cycle coming. And, when we cross with the strategic buyer that could but it at a price where they could get their value and we could get our value, it made total sense. And, if you look at somebody else indicated earlier in the call, that's been kind of our approach to the businesses, you could call a niche business that are on the outside of the portfolio.", "In this case, SubCom is a niche, but it's a world leader in what it does. So it has real value. And I think it's going to be with us for a long time.", "William Stein", "Great, thank you.", "Tom Lynch", "You're welcome.", "Sujal Shah", "Thank you, Will. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Sherri Scribner", "Hi, thanks. I was just hoping you could give us a little more detail on the pieces of the BNS businesses that you're just selling and what specifically those products are and how much of that came from the ADC acquisition?", "Tom Lynch", "Sure. There's really I would say three -- a lot of products, but if you wanted to break it down, what we call the telecom business was half of that came from ABC and half of that came from TE. And those are the fiber optic and copper connectivity solutions that are in the outside plant of a telecom or a cable network.", "So they're connecting the fibers and the coppers and collect that go from the origination of the signal out of a cable head end or a central office for telecom through the network to your house or to a node close to your house. That's half of the business, a little over half of the business.", "About 40% of the business are what we refer to enterprise. So that's sort of the conventional way to describe it as structured cable in the enterprise or in the data center. So that's where in your office you have the communication cable behind the wall that provide that come to the outlet that we used to plug our PCs in to get data and we now have wireless access point on the end of those cables.", "And that's a business -- that's a lot of small transactions all around the world. And then, the remaining piece of the business for us is this relatively small niche digital antenna business.", "All of the digital antenna business came from ADC. About 20% of the enterprise business came from ADC and a little over half of the telecom business came from ADC.", "Sherri Scribner", "Okay, thank you. That's helpful. And then just thinking about the consumer business that business has been declining for you in terms of revenue on a year-over-year basis since you broke it out. I am trying to understand what type of goals do have for that business? And what needs to happen there before you make a decision that maybe that's also a piece of business that you may want to divest?", "Tom Lynch", "Yes I have said before I hate to never say never. But, because you can imagine we study and think about this a lot. But I have not come up with any multitude of scenarios that we've played out where we would sell our consumer device connectivity business. It is what we do.", "What we're doing differently, is coming at it much more as a product and a platform business. So, while we have it in a segment in a vertical market, it's optimize miniaturization. Optimize antennas things like that. Optimize high-speed cable assemblies that are needed with the capability that is needed all over the company. Some of the company has its own capability and some of it relies on consumer.", "But to really come at it from much more of a platform basis, so that it's much less trying to pick a winner that you win which in this consumer business is very, very difficult to do. And because we've been trailing it for a few years, it makes it even more difficult when you're not the incumbent.", "So the strategy there is to run it a little differently. And by combining it with the DataComm, it would be more cost-effective. It would be better with the customers. So we're not -- we collaborate nicely, but really one face with the customer.", "And the focus is to put more emphasis and more investment which we will be able to, once we do this on a really critical technologies and get out of stuff that I know we've been in it for 15 years, but that's become a real commodity in the business and you're never going to make double-digit margins on it.", "We expect these businesses over the next say 18 to 24 months things will get back to double-digit margins and I don't think that's a whim. There is a real plan to get there. That's based on some success that we've had already in platforms.", "Sherri Scribner", "Thanks Tom that's helpful. And then Bob, I just wanted to ask in terms of the cash balance. It looks like the cash balance now is relatively low after acquisitions. Can you just let us know what type of cash levers you need to run the business and I know there are some timing issues in there. If you can just tell us what brings that cash level backup. Thank you.", "Bob Hau", "Sure. Thanks. The cash balance is down a bit, obviously in the current quarter we paid for the measurement acquisitions. So we had built up quite a bit of cash in the preceding quarters. But, we're sitting at about $900 million of cash, a level that we're very comfortable with.", "$0.5 billion to $1 billion, $0.75 billion is kind of what we need to operate and not an issue there whatsoever and of course we're very strong cash generating business. First quarter is traditionally our latest quarter and that will be the case for 2015 also.", "So that will ramp as we get into Q2 and beyond.", "Sherri Scribner", "Thank you.", "Sujal Shah", "All right. Thank you, Sherri. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citi. Please go ahead.", "Jim Suva", "Thank you very much. Could you first of all I have a question for each of you. Maybe if Bob could let us know little bit, just to be clear, the stock -- accelerated stock buyback announced today and I assume fiscal '15 EPS does not include anything from the accelerated portion of that?", "And then Tom, on the consumer you mentioned that you're narrowing your focus. TE from the spin in 2007, the first few years was about narrowing the focus and now we haven't heard that for the past few years or at least maybe I don't remember it now.", "It seems like you're talking about narrowing consumer focus little bit again, but that narrowing of the consumer be completed? Thank you.", "Bob Hau", "Soon I hope Jim. There are some chunks. The first phase of it, you have a good memory was we really outsourced a lot of products back in the day and resold it under our brand-name. And concluded back then that really didn't make much sense given the changing circumstances in the industry. At one time it did, but it didn't. And that had distracted us a bit.", "Now it's really about -- it's really about platforming and getting out of these commodity applications where you're not really leveraging what we do best, precision engineering, high-speed, high power throughput.", "So I think we were too fragmented and the first go-round wasn\u2019t good enough and as the market continue to be very dynamic, there has only been one consistent player on top and everybody else underneath has changed than I think for where we were in the order of our position and our part of the market, we suffered from that.", "But I do feel like we have the team that's come in over the last couple of years and the product range that we're developing, that gives us the ability to not bet on customers, but provide core capability that you have to tailor or semi-customized for the customers.", "It's a bit of a change. This business has never been if I would have ranked us from strongest to weakest, it's never been amongst our strongest I would say over the last five or six years.", "I feel like we're rebuilding our strength because the fundamental knowhow is there and now we're much more focused. The results have to be produced. There's no question about it. But I would say over the last six to nine months I feel it taking shape that it's going to be a solid business.", "And I keep saying to everyone who asks me, would you consider selling this business? Never say never, but I don't even think about it because these are the products we make. The billions of things we punch out a year, these are products and they go into other places.", "So we're pretty confident we will move the performance of the business up that we move nicely with the Chinese OEMs. It's not enough to celebrate with. But it's through the key milestone of the last six month to change our position meaningfully there not just accidentally. And we've done that. It's not enough to declare victory.", "But we have a pretty stringent milestone here that we hold ourselves to and we're making progress. But it's going to be a couple of years before this is the double-digit business. But there's a clear path to get there.", "Tom Lynch", "And then Jim, from the standpoint of the share repurchase, we did not announce an accelerated share repurchase program. What we've said was the majority of the proceeds will be used for share repurchase. The Board of Directors did authorize an increase in our repurchase program, adding $3 billion.", "So we now have $3.7 billion of authorization and we will continue to buyback shares for our prior program, though the balance of this year, and then once the transaction closes, by the end of this calendar year, that $3 billion will be available for repurchase at that time.", "Jim Suva", "Great. Thanks for the clarification.", "Sujal Shah", "Thank you, Jim. Looks like there are no further questions. So if you do have question please contact Investor Relations at TE. Thank you for joining us this morning and have a great day.", "A - Tom Lynch", "Thanks everyone.", "A - Bob Hau", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 10:45 Eastern time today through February 4.", "You may access the AT&T TeleConference Replay System at any time by dialing 1 (800) 475-6701, and entering the access code 346561.

Please go ahead.", "Sujal Shah", "Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's fourth quarter and full-year 2015 results. With me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch, President Terrence Curtin, Chief Financial Officer, Bob Hau.", "During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release. In addition, we will be using certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning and we ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items.", "The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com. Finally, for participants on the Q&A portion of today's call, I would like to remind everyone to limit themselves to one follow-up question to make sure we are able to cover all questions during the allotted time.", "Now, let me turn the call over to Tom for opening remarks.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks, Sujal. Thanks everybody for joining us today. Over the next half hour, I will be providing a state of the company update, essentially a 2015 year-end review. I will also share our view of the economic environment in terms of what we see today and what we expect over the next year. Terrence Curtin, our President will discuss our business performance in detail. Bob Hau, our CFO will cover the highlights of Q4 and full-year financial performance and I will wrap up with the details of our guidance and key underlying assumptions.", "2015 was a very important year for TE. We made excellent progress on our strategy of expanding our leadership position in harsh environment connectivity and establishing a leading position in the sensor market. Economic cycles will ebb and flow, but we believe the strong secular trend of electronic content growth has a very long runway, especially in harsh environments, where we have focused the company.", "TE has the broadest range of connectivity and sensor products and we are very well positioned to take advantage of this secular trend. During the year, we strengthened our position in harsh markets with a significant level of design wins across our harsh portfolio, most notably in our automotive business. We expect that over the long-term we will generate sales growth of 6% to 8% in our core auto connectivity products on 2% to 3% vehicle production growth, which is a forecast for the next five years.", "In fiscal 2015, we completed the integration of our Sensor acquisition. Our hypothesis underlying these acquisitions was that our unmatched presence across virtually every industry, coupled with the broad technology range we are acquired would enable us to grow faster than the market and eventually expand into integrated solutions. This is playing out very well in our designing pipeline is growing rapidly.", "In August of this year, we completed the sale of our BNS business for $3 billion, several months ahead of our original schedule. With this divestiture, our portfolio is now 80% focused on harsh environment applications and approximately 90% of our business is connectivity and sensors and we have strengthened scale in all the markets we serve. As Bob will share more detail and as we communicated earlier this year, we expect to use the proceeds of the BNS sale on share buyback, which we believe is a great $3 billion investment of our capital.", "Now please turn to slide three for some more details on fiscal year 2015. 2015 was a year of very good performance across the majority of our business. Organic sales were up 4% and were up 10% on a constant currency basis. This growth was driven by our harsh businesses and the beginnings of a new growth cycle in SubCom, which more than offset the declining revenue in our data and devices business as we reposition in that business.", "Adjusted earnings per share of $3.60 was up 9% and up 19% on a constant currency basis. We delivered 80 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion on 4% organic growth exceeding our long-term model of 50 basis points of operating margin expansion on 5% to 7% organic growth.", "Adjusted operating margins exceeded 16% for the first time, reflecting a healthy portfolio and strong productivity performance driven by our TEOA business process. We also continued our balance and disciplined approach to capital allocation, returning $1.7 billion to our shareholders. We increased the dividend by 14% this past March and repurchased 18 million shares.", "Now please turn to slide four for a summary of Q4 results. Q4 was a challenging quarter as we saw further slowing of orders since our last call, reflecting weakness in China slowing in most of our industrial markets. Revenue of $3 billion was flat on an organic basis and up 6% on a constant currency basis, but slightly below our guidance range. Adjusted EPS of $0.90 was up 2% over the prior year and up 15% on a constant currency basis and at the low end of our guidance range.", "Please turn to slide five for brief overview of Q4 order trends, which will help frame our segment results and guidance. This slide shows our fourth quarter sequential order trends. As you can see orders dropped significantly in Q4 and declined roughly $200 million versus our expectations when we provided Q4 guidance in July. We typically see a seasonal decline, but this was much larger than expected. China orders fell for the third consecutive quarter and are now running almost 15% below last year's rate with the slowdown impacting all markets.", "We also saw a significant decline in global industrial orders due to a generally weaker growth outlook and the resulting typical contraction of inventory, both with OEMs and in the distribution channel. Recent order patterns and feedback from customers indicate that the majority of this slowdown appears to be a near-term adjustment due to lower levels of demand as opposed to a more profound downturn. And reinforcing this, we are not seeing cancellations or de-booking of orders. Looking forward, we expect continued economic growth in both the U.S. and Europe and as a result, would expect the industrial and distribution inventory correction to be largely behind us by the end of our second quarter.", "China is a bit harder to call as the Chinese economy is going through several transitions and is being impacted by the slowing industrial growth rate in most of the world. But China does continue to show strength in its consumer driven economy and our assumption is that our China businesses will bottom in Q1 and will return to growth in the second half. And it was very encouraging to see new car sales in China return to growth in September.", "With that backdrop, I will now turn it over to Terrence to cover each of our businesses in more detail.", "Terrence Curtin", "Thanks, Tom and good morning, everyone. If you could please turn to slide six for me to review transportation solutions. Overall our transportation solutions segment performed very well in fiscal 2015. Revenues of $6.4 billion was up 4% at both actual end rates as well as organic rates. Our adjusted operating margins were 20.4%. Once again we delivered growth above the market due to the secular driver of content growth, along with new platform wins across our global customer base.", "In the fourth quarter, revenues in the segment grew 2% organically. Our auto business grew 3% organically in a flat global vehicle production environment. Growth in the auto business was driven by Europe and the U.S. as well as Asia Pacific outside of China. Our sales in China during the quarter were essentially flat. Our auto business is exceptionally healthy with a rich pipeline of new platform ramps from design wins generated over the past several years that will continue to drive growth well above the market.", "From an order prospective, during the quarter we did see the slowdown in China we discussed last quarter and our order stabilized in the fourth quarter with the third quarter levels. These order trends, however, will affect our first quarter sales as China was very strong in the first quarter last year. For 2016, we expect China vehicle production to be up only 2% compared to 2015 and longer-term we expect China auto production growth in the range of 5% to 7%.", "As expected, our commercial transportation business was down in the quarter due to the continued weakness in the global construction and agricultural markets with Europe being the only bright spot where we had growth in that market. We do expect the commercial transportation market will remain weak in 2016.", "In our sensors business, we continue to build momentum and deliver strong performance. If you assume we have owned Measurement Specialties and AST in 2014, our total year-on-year organic growth in sensor would have been 12% in the fourth quarter. We have new design wins and a solid pipeline with the technology leaders in automotive, industrial and consumer markets. And to support the design win momentum and continued growth ahead of market, we expect to continue to invest aggressively as we build scale, supporting new design wins and adding to our unmatched customer facing sales and engineering resources.", "And finally, on an adjusted operating income level, the segment's income was $306 million in the fourth quarter, which was approximately flat with the prior year as we expected.", "If you could please turn to page seven so I can discuss industrial solutions segment. As Tom mentioned, we saw a slowing across several of the markets in the segment during the fourth quarter. When you look at the segment, 2015 started well but became more challenging as we moved through the year. The overall industrial market space slowed as a result of the oil and gas market decline and then by China slowing later in the year. To illustrate the trend we experienced, our organic growth in the segment was 4% in the first half of 2015 and in the fourth quarter we just experienced a decline of 7%.", "For the year, segment revenue of $3.2 billion was down 4% overall and flat on an organic basis, while adjusted operating margins were 13.5%. Geographically markets were mixed with organic growth in Asia, offsetting declines in the U.S., that were driven primarily by the oil and gas declines we experienced of 30%.", "From an end market perspective, the commercial air and medical markets do remain strong. The defense and energy and this energy does not include oil and gas remains flattish. And the real area that has slowed since our last call is the general industrial space with lower demand for factory equipment in connection with China's slowing. Our orders in the fourth quarter, as Tom highlighted, do reflect supply chain adjustments that are current both at our OEM and distribution channel partners. During the quarter, revenue in the segment declined 7% organically year-over-year versus an assumption of low single digit decline when we provided our guidance in July.", "Industrial equipment was down 3% organically in the quarter with 11% reduction in orders as we began to experience the effects of the slowing both in China and in the U.S. with our OEM and distribution partners. In our aerospace, defense and oil and gas business, we continue to see strength in commercial air that is partially offsetting an approximate 40% decline in our oil and gas business that results in an 11% organic decline for AD&M in total. For our energy business, it did decline 5% organically in the quarter driven entirely by China, while the Americas and Europe remained stable.", "Adjusted operating income for the segment was $110 million in the fourth quarter, which was down 23% year-over-year, due to the sales decline, currency translation and significant declines in our higher margin oil and gas and distribution business.", "Please turn to slide eight so I can talk about communications solutions. Our communications solutions segment is a tale of two businesses in 2015, with growth in SubCom more than offsetting the planned declines as we continue to reposition our data and devices business. In the fourth quarter, revenue for the segment of $684 million was up 1% overall and 5% organically. Adjusted operating margins expanded 450 basis points exceeding 10%. And this strong operational performance is led by the SubCom growth from our program wins and restructuring savings that we have been driving in data and devices.", "2015 was the beginning of a multiyear growth cycle for SubCom, with revenues just above $700 million. Based on the timing of the ramps of new projects, we expect to generate annual revenues between $700 million and $1 billion through this multiyear growth cycle. Our current backlog of programs in force is approximately $1 billion which reflect the completion of a large program at 2015. For 2016, we expect to grow SubCom high single digits year-over-year based on the timing of the project ramps and projects we see in the pipeline.", "And lastly, in the fourth quarter, our data and devices and appliance businesses were both affected by China slowing and the supply chain adjustments by our distribution partners, which are expected to last through our March quarter. Additionally data and devices growth was impacted by product exits initiated in 2015 as part of the repositioning effort. These product exits will impact revenue by approximately $30 million per quarter in the first half of 2016 and then tail off in the second half.", "Now let me turn it back over to Bob to cover the financials.", "Bob Hau", "Thanks, Terence and good morning, everyone.", "Please turn to slide nine. It will provide more details on earnings. Adjusted operating income was strong at $488 million, up 12% in constant currency, including $60 million of foreign currency headwinds, operating income was flat with prior year. GAAP operating income was $407 million and included $11 million of acquisition related charges, $28 million of restructuring charges driven by data and devices, as well as oil and gas and $43 million of other charges related to the BNS divestiture.", "Adjusted earnings per share was $0.90 for the quarter, $0.02 above prior year with strong operational performance on lower sales, incremental benefit from share buyback and negative impact of currency exchange rates. GAAP EPS was $0.34 for the quarter and included acquisition related charges of $0.03, expense from tax items of $0.40 and restructuring and other charges of $0.13. For the full year 2016, I expect approximately $75 million of restructuring charges.", "We ended 2015 with a full-year GAAP income tax rate of 21.4% and an adjusted effective tax rate of 22.3%. I expect the full-year adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 23% to 24% for 2016.", "Now turning to slide 10. Our adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 32.5%. It was negatively impacted by lower volume and lower sales of high margin products, including those in the distribution channel. Adjusted operating margins expanded 50 basis points driven by productivity from TEOA, restructuring savings and cost management. Total operating expenses were $482 million in the quarter and down 9% from the previous year, primarily driven by benefits of one-time expense reductions and overall cost control.", "We are making reductions in discretionary spending, but also continue to invest in harsh businesses as we see the slowdown as temporary. As a result, we do expect operating expenses to rise sequentially in Q1 as we get back to a typical quarterly run rate. In the quarter, cash from continuing operations was $540 million and our free cash flow was $389 million. On June 4, 2014, we received $100 million benefit from the sale of an underutilized asset which impacts the year-over-year comparisons with the cash flow.", "Gross capital expenditures were down $15 million year-over-year and expect capital spending rate to be approximately 5% of sales for 2016. We continue to have a balanced capital allocation strategy. In 2015, we returned $1.7 billion to our shareholders of which $759 million was returned in Q4. During the quarter, we bought back 10 million shares, roughly half of which came from the proceeds of the Broadband Networks divestiture. Since 2007, we reduced our outstanding share count by approximately 20% and expect to continue reducing share count in 2016. Now we have added a balance sheet and cash flow summary in the appendix for additional details.", "I will turn it back over to Tom.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks Bob. Please turn to slide 11 and I will cover guidance at a high level and we do have some additional details provided in the slide deck in the back. As we mentioned earlier, in the last 90 days we have seen demand further weaken particularly in China and across many industrial markets. This drove the weak Q4 orders I discussed earlier and translates to a soft Q1. We now expect Q1 revenue of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion, down 8% from the prior year and adjusted EPS of $0.72 to $0.80, down approximately 15% year-over-year.", "We do expect continued growth in the U.S. and European automotive market, commercial aerospace and in SubCom. This will be more than offset by broad-based inventory reductions in the channel and continued softness in China. Q1 is also impacted significantly by negative FX translation which is more than offsetting the benefits of the share repurchase on EPS.", "Please turn to slide 12. For the full year, we expect revenue of $12.4 billion, up 1% versus the prior year and reflecting 3% organic growth at the midpoint. Our adjusted EPS guidance is $4, representing a year-over-year growth of 11% at midpoint. Our guidance does include the impact of a 53rd week in our fiscal year, which includes approximately $200 million in revenue, $0.05 in EPS. It also includes the benefit of share buyback and the negative impact of currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, revenue is expected to grow a little over 4% and adjusted EPS is expected to grow by 14% year-over-year.", "Our full year outlook is based on the following market and regional assumptions. In transportation, we expect mid single-digit actual and organic growth. We are assuming that global auto production is roughly flat year-over-year with the first half being down slightly and the second half up 1% to 2%. We expect China to return to approximately 2% production growth in the second half. Longer-term, we do expect China auto production to be in the 5% to 7% range. We expect another year of strong growth in our sensors business and we expect that the commercial transportation market will remain weak.", "In industrial, we are assuming low single digit actual and organic growth. We assume that global industrial demand stabilizes in the 1% to 2% growth range and as a result inventories come into balance by the end of Q2 ending the negative supply chain effect on our business. We are also assuming that the oil and gas markets remain weak.", "In communications, we assume low single digit actual and organic decline, with growth in SubCom and appliances being more than offset by product exits in data and devices as well as continued China weakness.", "By region, we assume that the overall U.S. and European economies continue to grow albeit slowly and that China begin to level off and return to growth in our markets in the second half. I mentioned earlier, we have already seen some pickup in auto sales and the government is recently taken some additional stimulus actions in China. We believe that the core driver of growth in China, the rapidly growing middle class will continue. Our guidance assumes current currency exchange rates and as the year goes on we have much less of a headwind from FX translation and an increased earnings tailwind from our share repurchase program.", "Although this is a sluggish time in many markets I feel the company has never been better positioned with clear leadership across attractive harsh markets, a very focused portfolio, strong balance sheet and multiple levers to drive accelerated EPS growth. We have established a strong track record with 13% comp on annual adjusted EPS growth from 2012 through the midpoint that we are guiding for 2016. Constant currency terms will demonstrate a strong double-digit EPS growth in each year.", "I think all the actions we have taken to transform the portfolio drives TEOA across the businesses and focus on harsh environment connectivity and sensors is really starting to pay off. Fundamentally we view we are in a couple quarters slow down here and expect to get back to strong performance in the second half of the year.", "So with that, why don't we open it up for questions. Cynthia, could you give the instructions for Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And we will go the line of Amit Daryanani. Your line is open.", "Amit Daryanani", "Prefect. Thanks a lot. Good morning, guys. Two questions for me. One, maybe just looking at the fiscal 2016 EPS guide, I think at the midpoint you are implying about $0.40 incremental EPS year-over-year on probably no revenue, about 1% maybe, right. Could you maybe talk about, if I think about the $0.40 EPS uptick, how much of that is going to come from operating margins or whole levers versus buyback deals that you have are probably some kind of a split between the two?", "Tom Lynch", "Hi, Amit. I think kind of three key drivers. We certainly get a nice lift and Bob will talk a little bit more later on, I am sure, from the buyback in the first half of the year. We still have to overcome the negative impact of translation. We don't really see net impact of buyback or translation in any significant way until the second half. And our second half assumes we get back to low to mid single-digit growth rates, which we expect will power operating earnings improvement. So it's a pretty significant contribution from the buyback, lesser contribution for the full year from operating margin improvement. In a flat year, we expect that the relatively flat at the OI margin, but up in the second half over prior year.", "Amit Daryanani", "Got it. And then, Tom, Terence, you both seem to be fairly convinced that this is more of benign inventory correction and things should start to normalize in a quarter or so. I guess I assume you can talk about, are you seeing the different book-to-bill auto trajectory between what you see in the channel versus OEM that gives you comfort that this is more of an inventory correction versus a bigger demand vacuum that maybe we are getting into?", "Terrence Curtin", "Let me take that, Amit. Good morning. When you think about it, we did see and as I talked a little bit in the industrial overview I gave, we did expect through our channel partners, it would probably be pretty flat in the fourth quarter and actually their activity, through their point-of-sale and what we saw was probably more down mid-single digit which then clearly creates pressure on them trying to get their inventory back in position.", "We did also see OEMs, especially in places like the United States that we did see the slowing, move a little before that earlier in the quarter. So we have seen the traditional OEMs start and the channel partners and when we look at it, it feels very similar back in 2012 and 2013, where we had a similar phenomenon where you had stepped out in growth that occurred and then clearly supply chain start to correct.", "The other area that we are expecting a channel correction is in China auto. I think when you look at the order comments I made and where China those orders stabilize, but we are getting impacted in the first quarter as that growth of that market slows down from what used to be a 10% production environment to 2% production growth environment.", "So there are a lot of signals. On that, I would say our orders in October are sort of where we expect them to be versus the forecast we have given. So it does seem to have stabilized, but we have to see. I think when it comes out is certainly the big wildcard.", "Amit Daryanani", "Thank you.", "Sujal Shah", "Can we have the next question, please?", "Operator", "And that will be from the line of Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Wamsi Mohan", "Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Tom, can you elaborate on what you are seeing in China, particularly as it relates to the auto end market? Maybe if you could share some clarity on what the trends have been you to the extent that you can see between like Tier 1, Tier 2 cities versus lower tier and domestic versus multinational corporations? And I have a follow-up.", "Tom Lynch", "Sure, Wamsi. I was just there a couple weeks ago. Imagine, spent a lot of time with our auto team. So the macro trends is early in the year, this calendar year, we began to see the growth rate of registrations decline and production follow that. There was a couple of blips up and down through the year. But I would say, form March on a pretty steady decline through July. And a lot of folks think that's in reaction, a little bit of the slowing of the economy, I think the great uncertainty and then of course the volatility in the China stock market where individuals have quite a lot invested.", "But what we have seen recently is registrations picking up and I think on the verge of the third month in a row of registrations picking up, which is a really good sign. In some ways not surprising because you still have a lot of positives in the China economy. The growth of the consumer and services sector, which the government has been trying to accomplish for a long time and now that's the biggest sector of the economy and that puts a lot less volatility in the economy. It also continues to drive significant wage growth as people move from the interior into the city.", "In terms of demand between the Tier 1s, Tier 2s, Tier 3s, I think we will see that three and four cities growing faster just because there has been a lot less car purchases there over the last three to four years and those cities, they are growing faster than the Tier 1s and Tier 2s. And in multinational versus local, a little more momentum in the local customers lately. They have a very nice fleet of SUVs and SUVs has become very popular in the last year. For us, we are strong across all the OEMs there in the Tier 1.", "So a switch between multinational and local doesn't really affect us. And in fact in the last big downturn, we did a lot of things to get much closer to the local suppliers and we provided more services to them than the typical connectivity supplier would and that served as well and got us a lot of designing over that time.", "So shifting trends, but when you really translate that back into content per vehicle in China, it's still moving up. There isn't a big change in the content per vehicle. We continue to see the fundamental trends, the more electronics. And people want to own cars. So this recent trend is very encouraging as its ramping pretty nicely from registration level in July to registrations level in October.", "Wamsi Mohan", "Thanks, Tom I appreciate the color there. And then one for Bob really quick. Bob, is there a way to think much of that EPS benefit or margin benefit year-on-year's coming from a commodity tailwinds if you could quantify that for all of 2016, that would be great. Thanks.", "Bob Hau", "Yes. I think the best way to think about it, first off is, certainly we are seeing improvement/tailwind in a number of our commodities, the largest one, the biggest to move is copper. So we are definitely anticipating improvement year-over-year on that. What does moderate that, of course, is we have a hedging program and so you don't see big moves or shocks to the up or down side of our commodities. So I would say, we expect probably$0.08 to $0.10 benefit in 2016 over 2015 as some of the hedging that we put in place throughout 2015 feathers in over the next 12 months.", "Wamsi Mohan", "Great. Thank you.", "Sujal Shah", "All right. Thank you, Wamsi. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "That will come from the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie. Your line is open.", "Mike Wood", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. It would be very helpful if you could quantify the gross margin impact from the destocking in this quarter and then your fiscal first quarter 2016, just so we can get a better understanding of the underlying gross margin trends?", "Bob Hau", "Good morning, Mike. Yes. I think the way to think about it, as you saw in the slides in my opening comments, we definitely a decline in gross margin. That's been a key tenet of our operating performance over the last several years and it is still very nicely from where we were two or three years ago. What I think we are experiencing in Q4 is not only the impact of distribution in particular, but overall volume, revenue down on actual basis 3%, organically flat. You see that impact flow through the factories in terms of absorption of cost when you get that quick reduction. Additionally impacting is not only the declines in distribution, which is a higher gross margin business for us, but also things like oil and gas and commercial vehicle. So all three of those distribution, commercial vehicles and oil and gas are better than company average margins and that creates, use a four letter word, mix issue for us but certainly something that as the distribution channel recovers, as we see that inventory correction improve in the second half year, we will see those gross margins come back.", "Mike Wood", "Okay. Can you also given us the amount of TEOA operating margin improvement factored into 2016?", "Bob Hau", "So I think as I mentioned, we see the gross margin and the operating margins improve on a year-over-year basis in the second half, as certainly there is benefits of TEOA, there is benefits of the volume coming back, as well as benefits of some of the restructuring actions we have taken. I think in our opening comments, we did mention, we don't expect commercial vehicles to rebound. That's been a tough market for the last few quarters. We expect that to continue. Same with oil and gas. I think the distribution channel will help keep a lift but certainly continue to drive productivity through TEOA and the metals benefit will also impact gross margins, as I said earlier in response to Amit's question.", "Tom Lynch", "And Mike, I would just add one thing about TEOA. If you were to go back before we use, we really had TEOA well established in the company. We typically did not offset price erosion with productivity. So we are very dependent on the volume to carry margin improvement. One of the reasons we are up 400 basis point, some of it is certainly the portfolio and some of it is because now TEOA is offsetting typically the 1.5% to 2% price erosion. So it's a significant contributor to that margin growth. So that when we do get the 4% volume growth, which six or seven years ago would not produce 80 basis points of margin improvement, now has enabled us drive 80 basis points. So it's subtle and it roving in there, but it's very, very significant. And of course the key thing with TEOA and it's primary purpose of it is to drive customer experience and drive high quality, which we generally get the best marks for the industry and high on-time delivery. So it's just really served as well as we have driven this across the company.", "Mike Wood", "Okay. Thank you.", "Sujal Shah", "All right. Thank you, Mike. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "That's from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is open.", "Matt Sheerin", "Yes. Thanks and good morning. A question regarding your comments on the communication solutions and your intent to deselect revenue and I think you talked about $30 million in the next couple of quarters. What does that translate in terms of annual revenue run rate? And what does that do to the margin structure of that business? And are there related restructuring charges or costs that you plan to take out there?", "Tom Lynch", "Yes. So Matt, a few of us can probably answer this question for you, part of our core strategy has been to reposition the business around the products that really have margins. The power products, miniature products, the high-speed products which we are best at and move away from the commodity products. So to kind of put it perspective, we took out almost $200 million worth revenue in 2015 and we held the profit in that business. And that was a negative margin business. It was very low margin business. We just felt it wasn't strategic in any way and had very little prospect to improve margins. So the cost actions we took to enable us to maintain profitability at the same level with $200 million plus margin, I think hopefully that gives you a perspective of where we are going with that business.", "Terrence Curtin", "I would also add, Matt, it's Terrence, when you look at next year, I mentioned there will be $30 million of a headwind in quarter one and quarter two, that will tail down probably for the year, about $90 million in total. It really ties in to when we talked last year about the combination of our Datacom and devices unit as we got that focus.", "So Bob, if you want to talk to charges.", "Bob Hau", "Yes. I think, Matt, I mentioned that we have got about $75 million of restructuring charges anticipated in 2016. A good portion of that is associated with actions we have got underway in data and devices. As you recall, last year 2015, we also had significant restructuring charges. We spent on a full year basis, about $93 million. 60%, 65% of that was the data and device business units. So we are definitely aggressively attacking the cost structure as well as [indiscernible] benefit impact continues in 2017 and beyond.", "Matt Sheerin", "Okay. That's helpful. And then regarding the commercial transportation business. You talked about that continuing to weaken next year. Obviously you are starting off of a pretty low base and tough comps year over year, which will get easier at the end of your fiscal year. But are you expecting that to bottom in the next quarter or so and stabilize? Or will that continue to weaken?", "Tom Lynch", "No. we expect the market to remain weak and I do think we expect some bottoming around middle year. But overall we are expecting growth in that market for the year.", "Matt Sheerin", "Okay. That's it for me. Thanks a lot.", "Tom Lynch", "Thank you.", "Sujal Shah", "Thanks, Matt. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "And that will be from the line of Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research. Your line is open.", "Shawn Harrison", "Good morning. I was hoping to talk about the buyback just in terms of how much is left and maybe if you could walk us through the cadence of the buyback expected through the end or I guess throughout the next couple quarters? And when you think you will be done with using all the proceeds from the BNS sale?", "Tom Lynch", "Yes, Shawn. Good morning. We started the share buyback in the fourth quarter. We closed the deal at very end of August. So the month of September, we were in the market. For the quarter, we spent about -- we returned about $625 million. About half of that was the proceeds from the BNS transaction. So call it $0.7 billion or so left. And I think the way to think about it is, we will exhaust that. We will have completed that return probably by the end of third quarter of this fiscal year.", "Shawn Harrison", "And to be clear, that's in addition to the consistent cadence have of $150 million to $250 million a quarter, which you have targeted previously?", "Tom Lynch", "The money become pretty fungible one it hits the bank account. We have got the cash now and there are some practical limits to how many shares we can buy in a given quarter or a given day with some, the 10b-18 rules. So I think the way to think about it is the BNS proceeds get returned in the first three quarters and then fourth quarter we look to get back into the more normal phase.", "Shawn Harrison", "Okay. And then maybe just another way to ask the inventory question. Is there any way to parse out how much of the decline in bookings you saw exiting or for the quarter, that was tied to inventory corrections, be it either at the channel level or the OEM level versus just weaker general demand? I know it ends up being mixed a bit. But any clarity there probably gives us greater confidence in this back half ramp.", "Terrence Curtin", "Yes. Shawn, it's Terrence. When you look at it and certainly to your point, it does get mixed when you look at the math patterns. But we estimated both through channel and OEM ordering we think it's a little shy of $100 million. So probably in that $75 million to $100 million range, certainly spread across China, as well as our OEM and distribution partners.", "Shawn Harrison", "Thanks so much, Terrence.", "Sujal Shah", "Thank you, Shawn. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "And that will be from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Craig Hettenbach", "Yes. Thank you. Tom, there still seems to be questions from investors in terms of buyback versus M&A and you are going to go through the proceeds of BNS to use that to buyback stock. But can you just talk about your balance sheet, your cash flow and the optionality you have for doing potential deals and also what the deal environment looks like today?", "Tom Lynch", "Sure. I think we feel very good as the highest level with a strong balance sheet, strong ongoing cash flow generation and especially a lot of cash in the bank now, the ability to return the BNS cash and to continue the two-thirds, one-third capital allocation, we feel like we have enormous flexibility. There is a nice pipeline that we have and it's very focused on harsh businesses, as we have dedicated many times.", "And I think the way to think about it, it wasn't that long ago, we spent $2 billion on the sensor acquisitions and the oil and gas acquisition and they quickly went back into normal share buyback and then we did the BNS deal and now we are into much bigger share buyback, I think what all that says is, the broad strength of the company gives us a lot of choices.", "If you go back a few years ago, when we met $2 billion on Deutsch, we went a couple of quarters without buyback, but then went right back into it. And then had a year of a lot of buyback, almost all of our cash flow going to buyback. So I think that we are pretty confident that while M&A may take precedence in one quarter and buybacks in another that over a couple year period, that two-thirds, one third, really fits with our business strategy, first and foremost.", "So just to reiterate, we look at our strategies, the areas we want to lead in, the products that we want to add to our portfolio so we can take advantage with our scale, that's what drives our strategy and our M&A pipeline and then we balance that against where we believe this company has a lot of value creation ahead of us and it makes sense to use a fair amount of our cash flow to take back shares. So I think you could continue to expect a very balanced approach here operating within this two-thirds, one-third framework that we have. And whenever there comes a point that we need to change that, we will give plenty of advanced notice, but it's been working very well for us.", "Craig Hettenbach", "Okay. Thanks for the color. And as a follow-up for Bob, when you think about the SubCom business, the growth into fiscal 2016, can you touch a bit on the margins? I know typically as those programs ramp in force, the margins improve over the course of the programs. So can you touch on that?", "Bob Hau", "Yes. The way to think about it is, in this $700 million, $800 million range, we are nicely into double digits, low teens. As we approach $1 billion over the next several years, depending on the timing of new programs and how quickly those ramp up, you can expect us to get up in the company average operating margins.", "Craig Hettenbach", "Got it. Thanks.", "Sujal Shah", "All right. Thank you, Craig. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "And that's from the line of Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is open.", "Jim Suva", "Thanks very much. A question regarding the industrial solutions segment which, in my mind, has quite a bit of area for improvement. When we think about the decline in sales versus the decline in operating margins, obviously there's leverage there that's going on in a negative manner and things like that. Is there anything to believe that if we were to see the exact opposite, that margins shouldn't rebound right back up to where they were prior to that decline? Or is there something going on within the business? The reason I ask is, with actual down 12% in sales, organic down 7% and seeing operating margins down 23%, that's kind of quite a big deleveraging. So I am just wondering if there's anything in addition we should be aware of? Or if indeed sales at some point were to improve and say be up 12%, should we be up right back to where we were the operating margins or even better, given TEOA?", "Terrence Curtin", "Jim, it's Terence. So I think you are thinking about it right. When we look at that segment, we do view that segment long-term should be above the company average. So from that framing we still believe that. I think when you look at the fourth quarter, clearly the revenue decline as well as oil and gas with some of the distribution slowness which are higher all sort of hit at once. That exasperated the margin. But when you look at it, clearly places like commercial air, industrial equipment, defense are above company average. So I do believe that as that comes back and we get through some of the destocking, you will see that market move back up and there will be an opportunity.", "Jim Suva", "Great. Thank you very much and congratulations to you and your team.", "Sujal Shah", "All right. Thank you, Jim. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "That will from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Mark Delaney", "Yes. Good morning and thanks very much for taking the questions. First question is a follow-up on the supply chain inventory reductions that the company was talking about. And I was hoping you could help us understand where you expect inventory of TE products to be at OEMs and distributors as you exit 1Q? And the reason I ask is, I am trying to get a better sense for what gives you guys the confidence for the revenue pickup in the remaining quarters of fiscal 2016, because even stripping out the extra week, it looks like you are assuming above seasonal quarter-on-quarter trends for the remainder of the fiscal year.", "Tom Lynch", "Yes. I think when we view this inventory correction, it's really a three quarter process. It started in Q4. Our current assumption is that it's the worst impacted in Q1, but still fairly significant impact in Q2. So it's going to take nine months. And we don't really have any big spring back baked in this year. So almost I think about it as, it kind of gets neutral in the second half of the year. So our second half isn't really thinking of a spring back.", "The way I would frame it, were you to think about how the year will progress, starting with Q4 of this year you have a negative impact from China, you have negative impact form inventory and the continued year-over-year negative impact of foreign exchange. The core markets, everything excluding that, running pretty steady. We go into Q1, it's a little worse on China and inventory. It continues at about the same negative impact year-over-year on FX.", "As you move into the second half of the year, our assumptions and we will have indicators over the next couple months, but our assumptions are inventories in balance as you end the second of the year, China has come down to a level where it should start growing again, because it come down quite a bit from where it was a year ago and FX is kind of a wash. The dollar could change, but if it stays at the current rate, it's pretty much a wash in the second half of the year.", "And the rest of the business, we are not expecting any miracle in the second half. We are expecting production growth to be 1% to 2% in the second half. We are expecting core industrial demand to be 1% to 2%. So they are not really, I don't think aggressive assumption and really reflecting what we are hearing from our customers. So that's the way I, at a very high level, think about how we expect our year to unfold based on those assumptions.", "Mark Delaney", "Okay. Appreciate that. As a follow-up question, something to talk about OpEx. OpEx was nicely down in the fiscal fourth quarter, below what I was expecting. Can you help us understand where OpEx dollars should be in fiscal 1Q 2016? And then to what extent there's still any excess OpEx associated with the BNS transition agreement and if you could quantify that?", "Bob Hau", "Mark, I think the way to think about it is, first of all, we very typically have a rebound Q4 to Q1 of OpEx spending. There is typically a ramp that you see in the first quarter of every fiscal year. So expect to see that and we certainly expect OpEx, in general, to return to more normal level in 2016 over what we saw in fourth quarter more normal than first three quarters of the 2015.", "In terms of the BNS transaction, we talked initially about what we refer to as stranded cost. Some of the cost of the central services that we have. We use that kind of revenue. You don't necessarily take out dollar-for-dollar from a cost standpoint. We are still in the midst of transition or transaction services, agreements with the buyer and that will be in place for up to help a few years, a couple of years. We don't expect them to last forever. And individual countries, individual activities will feather in an out and that will give us the opportunity to manage those costs as those TSA programs unwind.", "Mark Delaney", "Thank you.", "Sujal Shah", "Okay. Thank you, Mark. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "That will from the line of William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is open.", "Joe Meares", "Hi, guys. This is Joe Meares, calling in for Will. Thanks for taking my question. I just had two questions regarding meas and the sensor business. What inning would you say you are in with regards to margins going from being dilutive to the transportation segment to being accretive?", "Tom Lynch", "Well, I would say we are still in the early innings of that. As you know, we said it from the beginning, hypothesis was this will provide us accelerated growth in a market that we had a small beach at. That is definitely playing out as our design wins have been really great, even exceeding our high expectations and the core organic growth rate continues in double digits despite a sluggish economy. the margin, we expect will take a few years to move out.", "It's definitely dilutive, but still generating 20 points margin in that segment. We do have the dilutive effect of sensors, but there is a clear path as we bring our scale to this business to get those margins. First thing, get them above company average and then get them up near the transportation average. But we are in the early innings on that. That's going to take some time, because the design wins to turn into sales and then to take advantage of that and turn that into scale. It's very much tracking to our plan and we feel great about that that acquisition.", "Joe Meares", "That's helpful. Thanks. I guess as a follow-on, you did mention, the transportation operating margin looked pretty solid despite the weakness in commercial transport at over 20%. What's helping here? Is it mostly the restructuring stuff that you guys have done? Or maybe mix in the other businesses?", "Terrence Curtin", "Yes, Joe. There has not been restructuring going on in transportation other than what we did several years ago. There was a little bit of work that was done early in the year around the acquisition. But that was very small and definitely behind us.", "Tom Lynch", "I think what it is, it is the basic productivity and efforts around TEOA and in this business. We expect the business to be at or better than 20% operating margin. I know there were a lot of questions at the end of the third quarter, because it dipped slightly below that. We, at the time, said look, it was largely driven by a pretty significant decline in commercial transport. We see that again this quarter, but we see the 3% organic growth in automotive that's just continuing to push productivity across the business. IT has been and will continue to be our highest operating margin business.", "Joe Meares", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Sujal Shah", "Okay. Thank you, Joe. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "That's from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Sherri Scribner", "Hi. Thank you. Thank you for providing some of the detail on the linearity of your expectations for sales growth in automotive through 2016, but I was hoping you could give us some detail on your thoughts of the linearity of industrial sales as we move through fiscal 2016? What are your expectations? How much upside in the second half is baked in? And then following that, can you give us some sense of your expectations for operating margins in the industrial segment? Should we expect them to get back to fiscal 2014 levels? How should we expect them to progress through the year? Thanks.", "Bob Hau", "Sherri, it's Bob. I think the comments we made around the inventory correction has been in the distribution channel. You may recall that the largest segments that participate in the distribution channel is the industrial solutions business. So as we see that inventory adjustment work itself out in the first half of the year, you will see that improve towards our second half and get us better year-over-year growth rates second half over what we have got first half. That does give us, on a full year basis, a low single digit growth organically as those supply chain numbers work out.", "In terms of operating margin for the industrial solutions business, I do expect an improvement in 2016 over 2015 and probably not too far off to think back in the 2014 levels. That 3% organic growth gives us a volume into our factories and we have said for the last couple of years volume will help continue to work TEOA. We did some restructuring back in 2013, 2014 in this business. And as that volume comes back, we will see those margins improve.", "And I think Terrence, in an answer to an earlier question, we expect this business to be better than company average out into the future in terms of overall operating margin.", "Sherri Scribner", "Okay. That's helpful. I guess just to clarify on the growth you expect through the year, is the primary driver of weaker growth the inventory correction? Or do you see some overall demand that you think will improve in the second half?", "Terrence Curtin", "Sherri, it's Terence. I think there are a couple of things. So when you look at the first half, we are going to be impacted by the inventory as well as oil and gas. We will still have a little bit of a headwind on us in the first half, because of how that came down. So when you say that those two impacts will happen in the first half. When you look at the second half, like I said earlier, comm air side of the business, the medical part of the business, we do expect to be strong. But we do think the general industrial space did take a step down in growth. But we still think it will be growth once these inventory correction work out.", "Sherri Scribner", "Thank you.", "Sujal Shah", "Okay. Thank you, Sherri. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "And that will be from the line of Steve Fox with Cross Research. Your line is open.", "Steve Fox", "Thanks. One more question on linearity, if I could. Just to clarify in terms of your thinking from a broad standpoint, are you assuming that some of the growth rates that you are talking about for the second half of the year are achievable even if oil prices stay where they are and the U.S. dollar stays where it is, because that's obviously been affecting demand beyond just direct oil and gas segment.", "Tom Lynch", "Maybe one way to help put a little clarity, as we think of our portfolio, we see about 70% of the portfolio is going to solid mid single digit growth. And that's mostly our big harsh businesses like auto, commercial air, our sensor business for sure and SubCom. So when you put those together, we are going to have solid growth really through most of the year with the exception of Q1.", "We expect our industrial and our energy and appliance businesses to get back and work through the inventory correction start to grow in the second half. But we are not looking at, as I said earlier, miraculous growth. Kind of low single digit growth. And we expect industrial transportation, oil and gas, data and devices to be down year-over-year for the year.", "So I guess the answer specific your question, we are not assuming any benefit from something happening in oil and gas or any further worsening from oil and gas sure.", "Steve Fox", "That's fair. And then just one quick follow-up, given the timing of some of your acquisitions and the recent slowdown, I was just curious, have you seen any kind of unusual competitive behavior that you had to factor into your guidance for next fiscal year? Or do you feel like things, even with what's going on in terms of distribution, things are fairly well in check in terms of what you are using income from the contribution?", "Tom Lynch", "We haven't, Steve. And we monitor that kind of thing pretty closely. But I would say, no, I don't. It's such a fragmented industry with the exception of a couple of industries that we don't see any sort of competitor or two getting to progressive. I think basically the industry has gone through, a few industries have gone through a little pause, but most of these industries are still fundamentally healthy and it's essential for our customers to keep adding connectivity to their products for them to stay competitive. So that's this secular trend that is so beneficial to us and for example, we are not really seeing any change certainly no slowdown in the rate of projects we bid on, design activity our customers are bringing us in on. So we were not seeing any of that. So the fundamental drivers of the business are still very robust.", "Great. That's encouraging. Thank you very much.", "Steve Fox", "Thank you.", "Sujal Shah", "Thank you, Steve. It looks like there is no further questions. If anyone has any questions, please contact Investor Relations at TE.

Press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com.", "Finally, for participants on the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call, I\u2019d like to remind everyone to limit themselves to one follow-up question to make sure we are able to cover all questions during the allotted time.", "Now, let me turn the call over to Tom for opening comments.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks for joining us today and please turn to slide three and we will review the highlights on today\u2019s call. Q2 was another quarter of good execution and what continues to remain a sluggish global economic environment, adjusted earnings per share of $.90 with $0.2 better than the midpoint of our guidance on sales of $2.95 billion which was slightly below of the midpoint of the guidance. Strong operating performance across the company more than offset continued market softness across our industrial businesses. Our adjusted earnings per share was down $0.01 versus the prior year, but foreign exchange headwinds of approximately $0.02.", "On a constant currency basis, adjusted EPS was up 1% year-over-year. Adjusted operating margins were 14.9% in line with our expectations, but the adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 20% in the quarter. For the full-year, we are reiterating the midpoint of our guidance of $12.3 billion in revenue and $4 and adjusted Earnings per Share, representing an increase of 11% over prior year EPS. We expect to return to revenue growth in the second half and to generate double digit EPS growth.", "Our outlook for organic growth 3% down slightly compared to our guidance of 90 days ago. Our auto business remain solid the industrial inventory correction is largely behind us and SubCom continues to build momentum. Our recent acquisition of Creganna is known our guidance as well. These positive factors are offsetting the lower-than-expected growth in most industrial markets and slow growth in our non-transportation business in China.", "Our EPS growth is benefiting from cross controls, the benefits of our share buyback and bit of a lower tax rate. We have developed multiple levels [ph] to drive earnings growth in a slow economy. During the quarter, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders including $1.1 billion in share buybacks. We expect to continue to take a balanced approach with our capital strategy, returning approximately two/third of our free cash flow to shareholders over time with one/third of free cash being used for acquisitions.", "We generated $165 million of free cash flow in the quarter and $400 million in the first half of the year. We expect our normal strong second half cash generation to continue. We also continue to strengthen the company's harsh environment portfolio. In March, we completed the sale of our circuit protection businesses. Earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of Creganna, doubling the size of our medical business to about $500 million in revenue and establishing TE as a leading provider of solutions to the high-growth minimally invasive medical market.", "This morning, we also announced a small sensor acquisition, which will strengthen our portfolio of sensor technologies serving the transportation market. In our SubCom business, we continue to gain momentum with the recently announced award our project called Hawaiki, which is the new trans-Pacific cable system linking Australia and New Zealand to the mainland United States. This award will generate over $200 million in revenue over the life of the project and this business has a backlog of awarded projects of $1 billion.", "I\u2019ll now turn it over to Terrence Curtin, who\u2019ll cover our performance in more detail.", "Terrence Curtin", "Thanks Tom and good morning everyone. Before we get to the segment updates, I want to provide brief insights into our order patterns, which will help provide baseline for our results as well as the expectations. If you could turn to slide four please, and it shows order trends excluding our SubCom business. Overall, orders improved again sequentially and are above the low levels on approximately $2.6 billion that we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2015. And if you remember in the fourth quarter of last year, when we began to experience the supply chain impact related to the slowing in China as well as the industrial markets. We have seen recovery in orders and both of these areas and feel that the supply chain correction affect have completed in our second quarter as we expected.", "Certainly, we are pleased with the recovery in the orders, however the slow to recovery running behind original expectations in certain areas. Specifically in China, we previously thought [ph] that orders were continue to accelerate through the rest of the year while we believe the auto orders in China will continue to recover. We are now expecting orders outside of auto this will remain at the current levels that we are experienced in the second quarter.", "Let me now talk about the orders by segment. Overall transportation orders remain solid and in auto, our orders were negatively impacted by near-term customer backlog adjustment that related to a change in their schedule. I want to highlight this did not impact demand, it\u2019s really just a change in one of our customers processes. We continue to experience strong order trends both in Europe and in Asia in automotive. In industrial, orders grew 5% sequentially with growth in both our direct customer orders as well as those I go through our channel partners and distribution.", "As I stated earlier, the industrial inventory correction is now behind us and in Communications excluding SubCom, our orders grew 4% sequentially with a Book to Bill of 105 [ph] with improvement in both our plans and data and device business. As Tom mentioned, in SubCom it continues its momentum with new Hawaiki new program and will record that order as a booking in our third quarter.", "If you could please turn to slide five I\u2019ll discuss Transportation Solution results in the second quarter. Overall sales grew 3% in the segment organically in the quarter with growth across our businesses. Our Auto sales growth in the quarter was driven by strength in China as well as in Europe. For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect global auto production to be up 2% to 2.5% with growth in all regions as strong growth in China. We remain confident that our auto business can grow ahead of auto production driven by electronic content growth as well as a risk pipeline of platform ramps from designs wins that we generated over the past several years.", "In commercial transportation, sales grew 1% organically year over year driven by the heavy truck sector in both China and Europe. North America heavy truck markets continue remain weak, along with continued weakness in global construction and Ag markets. We\u2019re pleased that organic orders were up year-over-year as well as sequentially as we continue to perform very well in this business the top economic backdrop.", "Turning to Sensors, we saw 2% organic growth as we did began to feel the impact of weakness in the industrial markets in our sensor business and just the highlight for you about 40% of our Sensor sales going to the industrial markets. We do continue to see strong design momentum and long cycle transportation and industrial applications that we expect will drive future growth. From a margin view point, adjusted operating margins in the segment were 19% and were in line with our expectations and were up sequentially. The decline year-over-year was driven by currency impacts as well as investments for growth. We anticipate adjusted operating margins for the second half to continue to improve and should be at similar levels as a second half of last year.", "If you could please turn to slide six and I\u2019ll discuss the Industrial Solutions segment. Revenue in the segment declined 7% organically year-over-year in the second quarter. Geographically, we continue to see trends across our businesses that are consistent. Europe is stably growing in many markets. North America continue to see weakness due to oil and gas as well as the supply chain corrections that impacted us the past couple of quarters and China remains sluggish.", "We continue to be impacted by the oil and gas market with sold 42% organic reduction in sales year-over-year and the decline in oil and gas drives half of the organic decline in the segment in the second quarter. Low oil and gas prices continue to have a derivative effect of other areas of the industrial segment including factory equipment as well as helicopter demand with affects our aerospace business. We have included the impacts in our results as well as in our guidance.", "In aerospace and defense, our commercial aerospace business grew year-over-year and this was more than offset by the declines in the defense business due to supply chain affects that we\u2019re carrying in the distribution channel. Our energy business was down 2% organically with declines in Asia and Europe partially offset by growth in the US. As we look forward, we expect the industrial segment to grow sequentially and we expected to be essentially flat organically year-over-year in the third quarter and we expected the return to growth in the fourth quarter now that the inventory corrections are behind us.", "Adjusted operating margins were down year-over-year primarily by declines in the higher margin oil and gas business, but they were up sequentially. We do expect adjusted operating margins to continue to improve in the second half benefitting from increased volumes as well as the cost of action that we initiated.", "If you could please turn to page seven to talk about Communications segment. In the second quarter, the segment had revenue of $606 million, which was down 10% and 8% organically year-over-year and it was slightly ahead of our expectations. Our SubCom business saw solid year-over-year growth driven by strong execution from multiple projects of course and as Tom mentioned earlier, the total value programs of course is approximately $1 billion. We now expect SubCom to grow approximately 20% year-over-year and this is an improvement versus our expectation 90 days ago.", "Our data and devices and appliance businesses were impacted by distribution inventory corrections as I mentioned earlier and we believe these are behind us as we head into the second half of the year. Additionally, data and devices growth is impacted by the product exits we\u2019ve been highlighting all year as part of the repositioning effort and as discussed will impact our growth rate throughout this year. Adjusted operating margins in the segment declined 60 basis points year-over-year in line with our expectations and we do expect improvements to adjusted operating margins as we continue through the second half.", "Now let me turn it over to Mario, who\u2019ll cover the financials.", "Mario Calastri", "Thanks, Terrence and good morning everyone. Please turn to slide eight, where I will provide more details on earnings. Adjusted operating income of $440 million was in line with guidance and down 13% year-over-year due to currency impacts investments in transportation and the lower volume impacts that Terrence mentioned earlier. GAAP operating income was $535 million and included $4 million of acquisition related charges and net restructuring in other credit of $99 million primarily driven by again on the sale of our Circuit Protection business. Adjusted EPS was $.90 for the quarter down $0.01 from the prior year with reduced volume from higher margin products and negative impacts from currency exchange rates offsetting incremental benefits from share buyback.", "Excluding the $0.02 [ph] impacts from foreign currency, adjusted EPS was up $0.01 from the prior year period. GAAP EPS was $1.06 for the quarter driven by net restructuring and other credits of $0.17 primarily due to the circuit protection sale I just mentioned. We expect approximately $100 million of restructuring charges for the full-year, a $50 million increase from prior guidance. Regarding tax, it should continue to obtain [indiscernible] long-term adjusted tax rate as approximately 23% to 24%.", "Due to the mix of profitability in different reductions, we now expect our adjusted tax rate to be slightly lower this year. As we mentioned last quarter, Tyco International on behalf of they entered into an agreement with the IRS to resolve all disputes related to the previously disclosed intercompany debt issues. During the quarter, we made net pre-separation tax payments to the IRS of approximately $140 million to prevent further accrual of interests and penalties and help drive this settled and behind us in the near future.", "As you may know the Treasury Department should propose tax regulations earlier this month. One proposal addresses the tax characterization of certain intercompany financing arrangements. Multinational companies, TE utilizes intercompany financing for efficient capital deployment. We're in the process of analyzing these proposed regulations for any potential perspective impact on TE.", "Turning to slide nine, while we remain in the challenging environment, our performance was in line with our guidance and we expect improvement across our operating metrics in the second half. Our adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 32.6% a decline from last year and mostly driven by lower volume in areas like oil and gas and distribution, which have higher-margin than company average. Adjusted operating margins declined 150 basis points consistent with our gross margin performance.", "Total operating expenses were $523 million in the quarter down 5% from the previous year, reflecting strong spending controls. Continue to tightly manage discretionary spending while balancing our continuing investment into our Harsh businesses. Moving to cash flow and capital deployment in the quarter, cash from continuing operations was $155 million and our free cash flow was $165 million down from prior year levels due to timing of certain tax payments, but still up in the first half versus last year.", "We expect full-year free cash flow to approximate net income. We continue to have a balance capital allocation. In the second quarter, we returned $1.2 billion to our shareholders including $1.1 billion in buybacks. In the quarter, we bought back $19 million shares executing against our commitment of returning the proceeds from the broadband networks divestiture. Over the past 18 months, we have returned approximately $4.3 billion to our shareholders to buybacks and dividends.", "As Tom mentioned earlier, we expect to continue to take a balanced approach with our capital strategy going forward. We are also including a chart on adjusted EBITDA margins, which helps explain the profitability performance of our businesses including acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA margins in Q2 were 20% and show our margin resiliency despite lower sales levels. Continue to be pleased with the operating performance of our business especially in light of the challenging macro backdrop. We've also added a balance sheet in cash flow summary in the appendix for additional details.", "Now let me turn it to back to Tom.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks, Mario. Before I get into Q3 guidance on slide 10, let me provide some perspectives on why we will return to growth in the second half. As you know our first half was characterized by several year-over-year macro headwinds. Unfavorable foreign exchange due to the significant strengthening of the dollar against most major currencies, the significant decline in year-over-year oil prices, which resulted in over 40% decline in our higher-margin oil and gas business, overall industrial markets weaken leading to a supply chain corrections with OEM and our channel partners, which we believe are now behind us and weakness across most China markets.", "In the first half, the factors that impacted us significantly and in the second half most of these headwinds are reduced. As a result, we expect to returned to revenue growth and strong double-digit EPS growth driven by our Harsh strategy and the many levers and operating model. Now, I'll cover the Q3 Outlook. We expect Q3 revenue of $3 billion to $3.2 billion, up 1% on an actual base since flat organically and adjusted Earnings per Share of $1 to $6, up 14% year over year at the midpoint.", "We expect growth in transportation and industrial, which include approximately $60 million from the Creganna acquisition. This is offset by declines in communications from the sale of the circuit protection business and the continuation of our strategy to exit certain product line in data and devices. We do expect continued growth in our SubCom business.", "Now please turn to slide 11. We are reiterating our full-year guidance of $12.3 billion in revenue and $4 and adjusted EPS at the midpoint. On a full-year basis, continued strong performance of our transportation segment, the addition of the Creganna acquisition and growth in our SubCom business more than offsetting the negative impact of exchange rate softer industrial markets especially oil and gas in China. As mentioned earlier, the full-year and fourth-quarter include the 53rd week, which contribute approximately $200 million of revenue.", "On this full-year outlook includes unusually high Q4 revenue on EPS level compared to Q3. So I'll walk you through that. As previously mentioned, this year's fourth quarter includes an extra week, which contributes approximately $200 million of revenue and approximately $0.10 per share of earnings. Excluding the 53rd week revenue is increasing approximately $40 million from Q3 to Q4. So the way to think about this is the $240 million revenue will flow through to earnings at a 25% to 30% rate and this coupled with our typical productivity accounts for the significant sequential increase in EPS.", "Let me just wrap up with a few comments. As we mentioned earlier, the global economic environment continues to be sluggish. Despite this, we expect to generate another year of solid performance. Our focus on Harsh environment driving TEOA through the organization, strong cash flow and a consistent return of capital policy continues to enable us to significantly strengthen our earnings leverage. The dollar of revenue today generates about 40% more EPS than five years ago. This is serving us very well on a slow growth economy and will deliver accelerated earnings growth that the global economy improves.", "Now, let\u2019s open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go to the line of Amit Daryana with RBC Capital Markets.", "Amit Daryanani", "Thanks a lot. Good morning guys. I have two questions for me. Tom may be carrying on what you saw at the call with, the September quarter guys [ph]. Historically I think in September revenues seem to be down a little bit sequentially 2% by my math. So, could you maybe talk about what will be the comfort [ph] that sales could be up $43 million sequentially in organic basis? And then on EPS line, I guess the same thing you know [indiscernible] gives you $0.10; the $40 million would give you another $0.02, $0.03. I still struggle to get the entire $0.20 that you got to implant for September.", "Tom Lynch", "Hi, Amit. I think there is a little static on the line, try to get through this. Yeah, normally if you go back over many years, we had a few years we\u2019re up slightly in the fifth quarter few years, we were down slightly, I mean the last year was the free unusual year because that is where China and the Industrial price reduction began to occur. This year the pattern to coming into the fifth quarter is different. We have industrial markets improving; we have China well not quite as much as we thought it would be.", "For sure, the Auto market is improving as we expected. So, that's really the difference accounting for us, a slight sequential improvement as opposed to what we could just stay overtime and it\u2019s been kind of a. [inaudible]. We also pickup $240 million in revenue sequentially a lot of leverage come with it and that's [indiscernible] think we\u2019ll sure be in a 25% to 30%. The restructuring has been going on through the year continues to flow in an aggregate so they'll be a better benefit in Q4 and Q3 and then a normal productivity momentum, which marches through the year. So when you add all that up, that\u2019s how you get, its looks like a pretty significant hockey stick or you feel it back and say it's a small hockey stick.", "Amit Daryanani", "Fair enough. That is helpful to kind of get the leverage there. And then, I guess just the transportation segment I think you guys actually took up the production or unit expectation up modestly for autos. But the organic growth I think went from high single digit to mid single digit. Could you maybe just talk about what are the variables that leading to the lower organic growth within transportation for the year?", "Terrence Curtin", "Hi, Amit, it\u2019s Terrence. Two things, [indiscernible] for Auto production estimate. We\u2019ve been around that 2% to 2.5% since last quarter and really that is China be middle to higher single digits, Europe being about 1%, US about 4%. So that\u2019s we have not those assumptions. When you look overall at the transportation organic growth primarily driven by the comments I made around sensors. We did reduce our expectation for the year around sensors organic growth to really related to the impact of the industrial markets. So the growth we have there was lower this quarter than we thought and we are seeing order impacts due to some of the industrial impact that we\u2019ve seen elsewhere on the sensor business.", "Amit Daryanani", "Perfect. Thank you, guys.", "Tom Lynch", "All right. Thanks, Amit. Next question please", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.", "Wamsi Mohan", "Yes. Thank you good morning. Terrance, you pointed out strengthen Autos in Europe and China. I was wondering if you could talk about the order patterns in North America and Auto. Are you seeing any signs of deceleration in order patterns that is concerning to you at this point and I have a follow-up?", "Terrence Curtin", "Wamsi, thanks for the question. So, the one top comment I made around the backlog adjustment that was in our U.S. business and that was really scheduling change by did not have anything to do with demand, but we have seen in North America. We have seen some leveling of order patterns, as how with I must say there is an acceleration or deceleration outside that specific adjustment with that customer, but otherwise I would say --.", "Wamsi Mohan", "Okay. Great thanks and as my follow-up, transportation margins saw an year-over-year decline despite organic growth of 3% and reported to flat. Can you address what the moving pieces are? I think you called effects and some increase than last months, what are those increase in last month specifically? If you could any color on that? Thank you.", "Terrence Curtin", "When you look at those increased divestments, you know we had a tremendous manual program wins both in our Sensor business as well as in the automotive business, as you know the long cycle business. So we have been putting investment in just of both those programs. So it\u2019s mainly an engineering and product launch teams both in sensors as well as automotive around this program and then benefit us for two three years.", "Sujal Shah", "Okay. Thank you, Wamsi. We have the next question please.", "Operator", "It will come from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Sherri Scribner", "I think I wanted to get a sense of what drivers you\u2019re confident that the industrial segment will improve in the back half of the year. It sounds like you think China is going to be relatively flat, but potentially I think you\u2019re saying that the inventory situation is better. So, just trying to understand what makes you comfortable that things will get better in the second half? Thanks.", "Tom Lynch", "Sure. Thank you I\u2019ll comment and then I\u2019ll ask Terrence to answer it. I think a couple of things. One, when we look at inventory in the supply chain both that our direct customers and our channel customers, it feels like that pack a balance right now and that\u2019s what our channel partners feels well. So that\u2019s when the business started to go a little bit flat now, last year the supply chain adjustment negatively. So we\u2019ve been going through that.", "We do China gradually picking up. So and it really began to turn down in the second half of last year and in the fourth quarter of last year. So some of that is to compare, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re not producing a robust industrial market. It\u2019s really, things getting more imbalanced and then we\u2019ll have the benefit of the Creganna acquisition, which is in our industrial segment. So, Terrence do you want to add more color to that.", "Terrence Curtin", "No. I think, surely Tom said is very well. Last year fourth quarter is when oil and gas as well as lot of the channel and inventory effect head us. So in some ways it\u2019s a weak compared to the fourth quarter last year on an organic basis, but we do see that leveled out, I think the third quarter as we talked about that have been flat year-on-year, I think seems to be industrial world is relatively flat right now.", "So I think we\u2019re getting those supply chain affects behind us and oil and gas as well as we continue to expect to be very strong market and as Tom mentioned", "Sherri Scribner", "Great, that\u2019s really helpful. And then trying to ask a quick question on the communications margins, they were down year-over-year and I would have talked maybe would have been a bit stronger given the subsea businesses higher. How should we think about the subsea business impacting that margin as we move through the years revenue is stronger? Thanks.", "Tom Lynch", "Subsea, yeah communications as you know the mix of kind of three businesses are very good appliance business. Subsea business that is growing and first quarter margins were very high because we had to close out of the job in subsea. We expect to take couple of more quarters and that really pass the margin in the first quarter. Second quarter is more normalized for subsea. So I expect subsea will gradually improve. The data and devices margins will start to improve later this year, but we\u2019re feeling more optimistic about that.", "We did we were taken certain protection out that was been in the second quarter, but that is not in the balance of the year. So when you go business by business appliance, strong margins study, SubCom take the first quarter out in the little bit of abrasion growing at volume growth and data and devices always to start improving next year based on what we see right now.", "Sujal Shah", "Okay, thank you Sherri. We have next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you and that\u2019ll come from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.", "Craig Hettenbach", "Great, thanks. Question on Creganna, understanding at just close, but if you can just give some anecdote in terms of customer engagement number one, number two, just kind of what that does few more broadly and kind of the medical opportunity is that?", "Terrence Curtin", "Yeah. Sure, Craig. It\u2019s Terrence. So let\u2019s good order back the reaction from the customers have been very positive. Certainly we made the first movement in the space last year with and I think the customer reaction of having both of these together and to get bigger scale in a space, we\u2019re like said it\u2019s been a $3 billion market, but we basically a number two player right now in that customers have really appreciate. So that\u2019s pretty positive.", "I think secondly as we talked about the second part of your question around what those are do, which really nice about Creganna does for us. It really round out of the portfolio. So just to remind everyone, 90% of that integrated solution of we\u2019ll have internally. I think the other thing that is very powerful not only their position in engineering, but worse position in the world really balances that medical platform and they fill it not only the manufacturing or could the engineering until the gap we had around strong presence.", "And then, clearly bringing in 225 engineers and know that space, really doubled our engineering capability. So really have a very nice platform to continue to build up on and very early, but very excited that as well.", "Tom Lynch", "The one thing I would add Terrence is, we can\u2019t Creganna in China, but outside of the China and our robust platform across China had an existing medical business there in that market is maybe order minimally engaged because you have growing huge population and aging population and don\u2019t have the affordability. So this we\u2019re really excited about helping them scale much better to the in China.", "Craig Hettenbach", "Got it, thanks. And then, as my follow-up on the tuck-in announced this morning, if I look back to me the number of tuck-ins and then many deals to kind of built it based that you have today. So just your strategy in the sense from market, it feels like that\u2019s the market is very fragmented. There is a lot of growth, there is a lot of opportunities, but could we expect more along these lines in terms of you\u2019re doing these type of $40 million, $50 million type revenue deals?", "Terrence Curtin", "Craig, I think you said it very well. The number one, it\u2019s a very fragmented margin and what we liked about, what was announced today really is this is a speed sensor that product company that really placed very strongly into the transportation both in the industrial transportation side as well as automotive in the turbo charger applications. So I think when you look at the sensor space, you\u2019ll continue to see two things similar to this that has continue to built out portfolio as well as what we historically and continue to grow this business. So very excited about the business we announced last night and help us strength us in the transportations business.", "Craig Hettenbach", "Thanks for that.", "Sujal Shah", "Thank you, Craig. We have the next question please.", "Operator", "And it will come from Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.", "Shawn Harrison", "Hi, good morning everybody.", "Terrence Curtin", "Hi, Shawn.", "Shawn Harrison", "Just the buyback -- just to be clear on the math. Is there about $1 billion now available on the buyback and should we assume the June quarter get you back to the normal guidance of say 150 to 250 type of activity?", "Mario Calastri", "Hi, Shawn. This is Mario. We\u2019re still have about familiar $1.3 billion of authorized and just to remind that in terms of what we talked about in the comments, our strategy remains very much consistent with about and a reminder of what we have accomplished last 18 months and then, Tom if you want to add anything.", "Tom Lynch", "Sure. I would say yes. We\u2019re going to get back fairly to the lower end of the normal range in the next couple of quarters. We bought back $3 billion over the last nine months. We did make Creganna acquisition, but we feel these two/thirds, one/third split really works for us. We haven\u2019t seen anything that changes our view, is it from a strategic point of view that\u2019s the sensible capital allocation and as you know all of you\u2019ve been following us for a while. They\u2019 re experience we\u2019re at the higher in two/third\u2019s return to capital and then there is curious when we make any kind of sizeable acquisition whereas to below that.", "Shawn Harrison", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful and as a follow-up just on auto in general, maybe it\u2019s a two-parter. Have you seeing any impacts from the earthquake in Japan, I think Toyota was take around of $0.5 billion customer I mean some 20 or 11 are correct and then, just also on what you think the impact of China stimulus is on the business this year and how that got affect the business rolling in the fiscal\u201917?", "Terrence Curtin", "Hi, Shawn, it\u2019s Terrence. Thanks for the question. I think first of all let\u2019s take Japan, what I would say of Japan, I think you\u2019re sizing Toyota not right. When you sit there and you think through the earthquake in Japan, clearly that\u2019s a poor situation that we\u2019re monitor with our customer you know we have not seen any disruptions yet as part of assuming normal pattern, but demand that it may impact some timing little bit, but we\u2019re talking to our customers constantly and make it sure, we\u2019re helping that anyway that can stay more through you know that tragically in Japan.", "On China stimulus I think that\u2019s a little more of a complicate question that when you look at it, we did get it back in our first quarter as China\u2019s overall production so we talked about that. What we have seen is China comeback to about 6% production environment here both, which is pretty much in line with the EDP, I don\u2019t think we know whether the China stimulus accelerated some production or demand, but we do sort of view that China production long-term will stay around GEP from China.", "So, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re for off right now. I think we\u2019ll have to see as stimulus if there is any timing affect, but right now we feel pretty good as production has re-stimulated those from the first quarter being very slow.", "Sujal Shah", "Okay. Thank you, Shawn. We have the next question please.", "Operator", "Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Mark Delaney", "Yes good morning and thanks very much for taking the questions. The first one is a follow-up on the Q4 guidance and you\u2019ve talked about some of the top down factors that you\u2019re think about in terms of different end markets. Can you help us understand is there anything you\u2019re getting from specific customer forecast that are giving lot of visibility that Q4 is up sequentially from Q3? Anything kind of the I thought normally four to six weeks, so it seems like it\u2019s more top down driven, but if you have a bottom-up reconciliation that giving you more confident that\u2019ll be helpful I think.", "Tom Lynch", "We have lot of customers. So there is a lot of data point, I would say the biggest indicators are just one-one, and will be said in industrial. So we do see that sequential growth in orders and it continued in the April pretty solidly. So that gives us confident, it\u2019s not slam down. The channel partners are pretty much back to positive seeing POS in line with the increasing demand and reflecting inventory levels in the channel back in line. So these are all positive indicators in few records this time last year.", "Those indicators were starting to; they were raising caution going the other way. So that would give us some optimism. Again, we\u2019re not expecting a boom from Q3 to Q4. I think it\u2019s just where the cycle is this time versus prior years and of course that I always keep reminding you of that extra week. It\u2019s confusing all of us, but yeah there is an extra week there.", "So when you strip that out, we\u2019re talking about $40 million in revenue pickup, but right now feels, we think that balance I mean you know, we\u2019ll know a lot more at the end of the third quarter, but when we look at what the channel pattern is versus prior years, when we look at our industrial business this quarter sequentially and seeing it both in the OEM customers and the channel customers that will give us that confidence. Terrence you want to say something?", "Terrence Curtin", "No. I think you said it very well.", "Mark Delaney", "Okay. I appreciate the color and then follow-up question on the tax rate commentary and kind of actually two parts. So I think 23% to 24% was the comment. What sort of affect should we expect for the potential settlement around the Tyco liabilities as should we be looking for any other income line? Are there changes there? And then, can you just clarify does the long-term guidance of 23% to 24% include what you think of potential impact might be around earnings stripping regulation or you just have another chance to better put that into numbers?", "Terrence Curtin", "I think that what we talked about in the comments, our expectation from longer-term remains 23% to 24% that does not include any additional regulations related above any potential from there. We\u2019re still looking at it and when it comes to the second half, we do expect it will be a little bit lower than the 23% to 24% and that\u2019s mostly driven around distribution of profitability more than expectation around.", "Sujal Shah", "Okay. Thank you, Mark. We have the next question please.", "Operator", "Got the line of William Stein with SunTrust, please go ahead.", "William Stein", "Hi. Great, thank you for taking my question. I\u2019m still having trouble understating your comments about the transportation segment. I think that you noted that automotive is at least as strong as it look previously and it\u2019d be downward adjustment to the full-year guidance at segment is related to the sensor business. So you\u2019re seeing, it sounds like you\u2019re seeing industrial sensor applications roll-off just at the same time that you expect the rest of the industrial exposure to starting. So maybe step by reconciling that and then I\u2019ll have a follow-up to be?", "Tom Lynch", "Let me start with that. I think we\u2019re on where to think about the venture piece for that is growth is slowing whereas in the connector part of the business in which growth was down right, because of inventory correction fell. Now we expect what\u2019s going to happen in the second half of the year in the industrial connectivity business. Last we met a little bit of growth in Q4, but sensors with a different story, this really growth is slowing, reflecting, the certainty out there. Terrence, you want to talk more about transportation?", "Terrence Curtin", "Yeah. Tom he said it well. When you think through the interconnect we saw industrial about 50% of glossary distribution in sensor is very little down. So what we seen we\u2019ve actually our sensors industrial actually comedown and slow more like our direct customers. So Tom is very much right on it and the rest of the transportation is like we said in the comment, we see a production environment staying steady at 2% to 2.5% growth certainly China being the big driver. Europe being slight so we see that continues to be solid and transportation when you say it\u2019s down a little bit it really has to do with that sensor.", "William Stein", "So the follow-up there is, within transportation sensors are still quite small and 10% or 15% of the transport and suspect what\u2019s really driving the full-year differences some you made a comment on the prepared remarks around a supply-chain or some other inventory adjustment that one of your customers is making in North America. Can you help us situation is better said is we really trying to understand if this what\u2019s going on here in this sort of valid lead as to what\u2019s going on the industry or is this particular to TEE in a very temporary and then snaps back or is there a bigger problem here? Thank you.", "Terrence Curtin", "Well. It is actually just have customers getting these orders into and they change their process. So it does affect the numbers, it does not affect demand and that did impact our orders, but it did not impact the demand we\u2019re seeing from customers. So really it\u2019s just their process about they give orders, they changed more real-time to giving us the firm and that adjustment impacted our orders, but it doesn\u2019t impact the demand patterns at all.", "Tom Lynch", "What I add will is just to help the understanding, what I would add will is our automotive business will grow more in the second half than the first half. So we\u2019re not the mixes are changing you know North America flat flattening a bit China picking up, Europe steady, but when you step back to your question, hey is there something going on here? We actually are going to have stronger auto business in the second half than the first half, the overall sensor business growth rate lower in the second half than the first half.", "Terrence Curtin", "Just one last comment, the 2% and 2.5% production environment we do expect to be the high single-digits around the business.", "William Stein", "Thank you.", "Sujal Shah", "All right. Thank you. We have the next question please.", "Operator", "It comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research.", "Steven Fox", "Thanks. Good morning. Two questions from me. First was just getting back to the transportation margins. I understand the investments are going on and I\u2019m just curious if you can just give us some bigger picture comments on how you\u2019re managing those against our own short-term expectations from margins in that segment versus what\u2019s in the expanding opportunity for growth and then I\u2019ll had a follow-up?", "Tom Lynch", "Sure. So aggregate for three pieces of our transportation segment. Automotive, as Terrence said very strong business expect to grow mid to high single-digits on 2% to 3%, 2.5% production growth margins there remain strong. Sensors is below the transportation averages as you know with the acquisition with tremendous opportunity to move those margins up and we are investing at we\u2019re increasing our R&D investment at a faster rate than our sales growth in sensors because the opportunity is still great and customers absolutely like another strong resilient technology rich company providing sensors into the transportation market and we are getting significant design and that requires engineers since been our plan from day one acquisition.", "And then in the industrial transportation business, which is the highest margin business in the group. We are I think we\u2019re navigating very well maintaining our margins in a very really negative growth environment, our growth is just because of our wrong position in China, in Europe is offsetting, North America. So we\u2019re really within the segment. We manage those businesses separately based on the dynamic in opportunity.", "And Terrence said in his comment, we\u2019re pretty confidence that we\u2019ll margins approve again sequentially basic point Q1 to respect that March to continue in the second half of the year with a little bit of volume growth over the first half of year because there is a lot of operating leverage in this business.", "Steven Fox", "So, just pushback on the second point around sensors, so was it safe to understand and this was sort of un usual quarter in terms of the investment levels versus revenues actually ramping with some new programs and that gaps starts to close going forward or does it stay at these levels for a little while. If you could sort of qualify that? And then, my follow-up question was just to get an update on the CFO search. Thanks very much.", "Terrence Curtin", "Firstly, it is ramping. We began increasing our sensors investment late last year and certainly as we\u2019ve been programmed we thought design wins especially in longer cycle business, there will be a gap. So I don\u2019t think its ennobling [ph] but it\u2019s something we have to invest ahead and even in this programs. So it is a ramp that you\u2019re going to see in sensors. But we will expect as we\u2014", "Tom Lynch", "One more comment before the I just I think it\u2019s really important if you look at the transformation of the company to Harsh environment, auto businesses the down set definition and you know for us that engineer, high barriers intensity, the capital allocation strategy. You see how that enables us even in the slow growth market to make strategic investment something like sensors, which is going to be a big business for us. And so, yeah we have decided not to really change our strategy there even that we have already leveraged to drive the earnings growth that we set up six months ago.", "Well, $3 billion $4 billion in revenue and $4 EPS and that\u2019s part of the story too an important work. On the CFO search we\u2019re active as you can imagine, we have several internal candidates we\u2019re going to the external candidates obviously a critically important job, but I feel good about it, we have a very strong financial organization across the company and the team is doing great you can tell in an effective way been with 10 years very well and from mentioned, yeah that\u2019s an everyday and I would expect in the next couple of months will be make announcement.", "Steven Fox", "Great. I appreciate the color.", "Sujal Shah", "Thank you, Steve. We have the next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you and that\u2019ll come from Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Jim Suva", "Thank you very much. When you mentioned on the prepared remarks as well as a little bit on the Q&A about your automotive customer changing its supply chain a little bit. Can you give us some details like, did you benefit from that in prior quarter or it sound like this quarter you have some weakness associated with that? Do you then in the future weakness but it seems like at the end of the day, the supply-chain has to all connected and was that changed I assume lead by the customer and then rolled-out globally to them or already has it centre to around petroleum or diesel or electric or HV? How should we think about kind of what\u2019s going on there and is this a rippling changed the industry?", "Then my question or follow-up would be on the intercompany debt, I know you mentioned that the past historical IRS settlement is in work near interest for and I also correct to say that the new regulations also potentially and our due impact, current debt structure amongst the company and if so can you quantify or let us know about anything around that or is it all decently backward stating and going forward there are no considerations? Thank you.", "Terrence Curtin", "I\u2019ll take the first point and I\u2019ll allow Mario to take the second one. Number one, in terms of customer, so when you look at program I think that look at they changed their process. So certainly this was something that built up overtime that\u2019s why they did the process. They gave us very forward-looking orders that\u2019ll be recorded as orders of backlog. Now they moved to be a more with articulated and that had scheduling him up and they are going to head with orders more frequently that does create a debugging in our world. It does not impact programs that we won with our customers throughout the world.", "So when we look at this, this is something that is very and does not impact programs and can\u2019t get into individual diesel versus electric versus combustion engine and it isn\u2019t there and over time we will just get those orders in more frequently than having schedule back and forth. Now I\u2019ll let Mario turn over to sector piece on your tax question.", "Mario Calastri", "Sure. On the tax question, first of all on the settlement, we did mention that we have made a big payment to the IRS effectively, stops the accrual of interest on that liability which basically takes out most of the impact of the settlement when we would like to settle. So we already have included in our guidance the fact that we have made that payment that impacts our tax rate.", "On the second element, as far as the rights that are put in place, first of all those rights \u2013 those proposed rights are perspective though they do not have any impact on our current [indiscernible] company and again its complicated matter that we are getting our head around, but no, there is no impact to current in top of that decision that position.", "Jim Suva", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Tom Lynch", "Thank you.", "Sujal Shah", "Okay, thank you, Jim. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "Thank you. That will come from Mike Wood with Macquarie. Please go ahead.", "Mike Wood", "Hi. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. I realized your visibility is very good on the auto platforms, can you just give us your incremental enthusiasm or concerns over just where your share will be moving over the next several years and has there been any platform wins on the passenger vehicle side from measurement specialists?", "Tom Lynch", "Yeah, sure. Thanks. Yeah, I mean, I couldn\u2019t I have to contain my optimism around the automotive business globally and with our presence and range of technology, it\u2019s becoming more and more important. So we have a significant share in the connectivity business, but over the last five years, we believe we increased at five points. That is quite an accomplishment and it really is that these solutions get more complex and all we have to do is kind of look under the hood, see how different it is in the last five or six years. The connectivity in the sensing solutions are more complex. On the connectivity side, we continue to win at a rate faster than we have in the past, which is why I think we said a few times. If you go back five years and we talk about a 2% production environment, we would have talked about 3% to 4% revenue to TE environment. Now we believe that\u2019s a 5% to 6% and that\u2019s really more market share than it is content.", "So I expect we will continue to inch up our market share because of the range of capability we have in this, just for example hyper electric vehicles, the difference in our designing in the last three years or so the first \u2013 the prior five years is 2x to 3x. So at that market now continues to pick up. We have a high content and we are extremely well positioned with all the leading platforms. So we feel good about that. On the sensors side, we have one significant design edge technology and our go-to-market and our strength we bring and the credibility we bring to our auto customer.", "We are an auto supplier through and through and we are doing that for 50 years, so they like the technology and they trust us and we are wining important awards. They are not showing up in revenue yet, but that will be in the next couple of years, but \u2013 that\u2019s why when we talked earlier incredibly enthusiastic and feel that actually ahead of the hypothesis we had with [indiscernible] about our ability to bring their technology into this \u2013 the auto market, which is the best market for Sensors. Eric, do you want to add anything to that?", "Eric Resch", "No, I think Tom just said it well and also even with the small acquisition and we continues to get confident and leverage our go-to-market in the transportation area like Tom said, so I think our program wins, we\u2019ve been getting the other thing that\u2019s nice about it is they are on all geographies at the world, it\u2019s not just concentrated one geography, which actually leveraged with that that we have in our auto business. We always talk to you all about.", "Mike Wood", "Great. And as a follow up on the industrial orders, can you just give us the breakout of the OEM trend versus the distributor order trends in the quarter?", "Tom Lynch", "Yeah, sure, Mike. [Indiscernible] when you look that the trend in the quarter between the two that you had what we saw on the OEM side, year-over-year was relatively flattish and then on the channel side, we were still down year-over-year, but what\u2019s nice is it was getting back to where last year\u2019s order levels were which give us confidence that when we get to the third and fourth quarter our channel sales versus last year will be up because we did have that correction in the fourth quarter. The other thing that Tom mentioned that I think support our channel partners have seen positive POS, they are seeing a book to bill greater than one. So it\u2019s not only our order patter as we talk to our channel partners, they have also seen their book to bill go back above one as well as positive POS, so it\u2019s combination of those factors that we see.", "Mike Wood", "Great, Thank you.", "Tom Lynch", "Thank you.", "Sujal Shah", "Thank you, Mike. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "That will come from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Mark Delaney", "Appreciate you talking the follow-up. Just a follow-up on that tax rate question. Once the Tyco liability is settled should we be thinking about the other income from Tyco and Covidien going to zero, so tax rate 23% to 24% but assume no other income from that going forward?", "Mario Calastri", "Mark, sorry, let me clarify. The way you should think about it is that the settlement is going to be basically EPS [indiscernible] and there is going to be a [indiscernible] between the other income that\u2019s going to go away and tax rate is going to get lower. But this far into the guidance what we talked about the 23 to 24 and being a little bit lower in the second half does not include the sum. So we are just now including the settlement, but you should think about it as EPS neutral because we have done the prepayment to the IRS would basically stop the accrual on the.", "Sujal Shah", "Okay. Thank you, Mark. We have no further questions.", "Sujal Shah", "So thank you very much for your time this morning. If you have more question please contact Investor Relations at TE. Have a great day.", "Tom Lynch", "Thank you everyone.", "Mario Calastri", "Thank you everyone.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be made available for replay after 10:30 AM this morning and running through Wednesday, April 27th midnight.

Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Q3 2016 TE Connectivity Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Sujal Shah. Please go ahead.", "Sujal Shah - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's third quarter results. With me today are: Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch; President, Terrence Curtin; and acting Chief Financial Officer, Mario Calastri.", "During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning. We ask you to review the sections of our press release and accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items. Press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com.", "Finally, for participants on the Q&A portion of today's call, I would like to remind everyone to limit themselves to one follow-up question to make sure we are able to cover all questions during the allotted time.", "Now, let me turn the call over to Tom for opening comments.", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks for joining us today. Please turn to Slide 3, and we will cover the highlights from today's call. Q3 was another quarter of solid execution in what continues to remain a challenging global economic environment. Our adjusted EPS of $1.08 represents a new company record, and was up 20% on a year-over-year basis. Sales of $3.12 billion were essentially flat last year and in line with our guidance midpoint. Sales and orders were up sequentially, with sales up 6% and orders up 7%, excluding SubCom. Adjusted operating margins were strong at 16%, with adjusted EBITDA margins of 21% in the quarter.", "For the fourth quarter, we expect the midpoint of our revenue and earnings per share to be $3.35 billion and a $1.20, respectively. Note that these figures include the benefit of approximately $200 million in revenue and $0.10 in EPS from the extra week in Q4 that we've been communicating all year. If we exclude the extra week, we would expect revenue to be up about 3% organically year-over-year and adjusted EPS growth to be 22% year-over-year. Also, if you exclude the extra week, we expect our Transportation business to have its best growth quarter in Q4 and our Industrial segment to grow slightly for the first time this year.", "For the full year, we are reiterating our adjusted EPS midpoint of $4.00, representing an 11% increase over the prior year. Continued growth in most of our harsh businesses, cost controls, share buyback and a lower tax rate are more than offsetting the first half currency headwinds and supply chain correction. This has enabled us to reiterate our original guidance that we provided in October 2015, delivering double digit earnings growth in a slower economy. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to return to year-over-year organic growth in Q4, excluding the extra week.", "During the quarter, we continued to strengthen our harsh portfolio through acquisition. In April, we announced the acquisition of Jaquet, which bolstered our portfolio of sensors for the auto market. This morning, we announced an agreement to acquire the Intercontec Group, a German-based manufacturer of high quality industrial metric circular connectors. This acquisition strengthens TE's position in harsh connectivity applications for factory automation, and will be reported in the Industrial segment.", "In addition, I'm pleased to say our recent acquisition of Creganna is performing very well and ahead of expectations and positions TE as a leader in the high growth minimally invasive medical market.", "We had a very strong cash generation quarter, with free cash flow of almost $600 million, which brings our year-to-date free cash flow to just about $1 billion. During the quarter, we returned approximately $230 million to shareholders, including about $100 million in share buybacks. Year-to-date, we have returned nearly $2.9 billion to shareholders, including $2.5 billion in share buybacks.", "We expect to continue to take a balanced approach with our capital strategy, returning approximately two-thirds of our free cash flow to shareholders over time, with one-third free cash flow being used for acquisition.", "I'll turn it over to Terrence Curtin, who will cover our performance in more detail.", "Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director", "Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Before we get to the segment updates, I'd like to cover our orders for the quarter, which will help provide the foundation for our results and expectations, so if you could please turn to Slide 4. And this shows our order trends, excluding our SubCom business.", "Overall orders were essentially flat year-over-year and improved again sequentially by 7%, as the supply chain corrections that impact us in the first half are behind us. Our book-to-bill was 1.01 and we also had slight growth year-over-year, reflecting the recovery and stability of our end markets.", "In Transportation, orders remain solid, with 7% sequential growth. Industrial orders grew 15% sequentially. And I do want to highlight about 60% of the industrial order growth was due to the acquisition of Creganna, with the remainder of the growth being broad based across our Industrial businesses. In Industrial, we saw order growth in each region, as the inventory supply chain is now back in line. And we expect sales growth in the second half over the first half across each of our Industrial businesses.", "In Communications, excluding the impact of the sale of our Circuit Protection business last quarter, we saw sequential growth of 3%, driven by both our Appliances and Data & Devices business. Now, to talk to SubCom, now, the business continues its strong momentum.", "We were recently named as a supplier of the new MAREA transatlantic program. And with this award, we have approximately $1 billion of programs in force in our SubCom business.", "Please turn to Slide 5, so I can discuss our Transportation Solutions segment results. Segment sales grew 2% organically in the quarter, with growth in Auto and in Commercial Transportation, offset by weakness in Sensors that we highlighted last quarter. Our Auto sales growth in the quarter was in line with our expectations. And growth was driven by strength in Europe and China, partially offset by a year-over-year decline in North America.", "For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in Auto on a 2% to 2.5% global auto production growth environment. While we are maintaining our view of global auto production, the regional profile is slightly different versus our prior view. We now expect slightly higher growth in Europe and China, offset by slower growth in North America. We do remain confident that our Auto business will continue to grow ahead of auto production, driven by the electronic content growth, as well as a rich pipeline of platform ramps from the design wins generated over the past several years.", "In the fourth quarter, we expect our Auto business to have mid-teen organic growth, including the extra week. If you exclude the extra week, we expect our growth to be about half of that mid-teen growth in the mid-single digits.", "We are also very pleased with our Commercial Transportation organic growth of 3% year-over-year in what continues to be a challenging backdrop. The growth we experienced was driven by the heavy truck sector in China and Europe, while in North America, heavy truck market continues to remain weak, as well as weakness in the global construction and ag markets.", "Turning to Sensors, we saw a 2% organic decline, as we continue to be impacted by the weakness in industrial-related markets, which make up more than half of our sensor sales. We continue to see strong design momentum, especially in the automotive space, that we expect to fuel future growth. For the segment, adjusted operating margins were 19.4% and were in line with our expectations. And we saw sequential expansion of 40 basis points.", "Now, let me turn to Industrial Solutions, if you could please turn to Slide 6. Overall segment sales were up 5% year-over-year, due to the acquisition of Creganna. If you remove the impact of Creganna, organic sales declined 4%. About half the organic decline is driven by the impact of the oil and gas downturn, which has resulted in our Oil and Gas sales being down 31%. On a geographic basis, we continue to see trends across the segment that are consistent. Europe is stable and growing in many markets. North America continues to be weak, and China remains sluggish. When we started the year, we expected further market improvement in China and North America than what we're actually seeing currently.", "Now, turning to the markets within the segment, in the Industrial Equipment area, we saw 14% growth driven by the Creganna acquisition, which, as Tom mentioned, is performing ahead of our expectations. We are very excited about the growth potential in the minimally invasive medical market. If you exclude Creganna, the Industrial Equipment area, we did see a decline of 7% organically, due to softness in North America and in China, but we did see a sequential growth of 4% on an organic basis as we see markets coming back in line.", "In the Aerospace & Defense area, our sales grew 4% organically, with strong performance both in the Commercial air and in the Defense markets. And in Energy, our business was flat organically, with growth in the Americas and Europe offset by declines in Asia.", "As we look forward, we expect first half to second half growth of approximately 12%, with growth in each of the business units, now that the inventory corrections are behind us.", "From a margin perspective, adjusted operating margins were slightly down year-over-year, driven entirely by the declines in our higher margin Oil and Gas business, which impacted segment operating margin by approximately 100 basis points year-over-year. Segment operating margins expanded 180 basis points sequentially, as we expected, driven by both the benefit of increased volumes and cost management.", "Now, let me turn over to Communications Solutions, and if you could please turn to page seven of the slides. During the quarter, the Communications Solutions segment revenue was down 4% organically year-over-year, but grew 8% sequentially on an organic basis if you exclude of the impact of the Circuit Protection divestiture.", "Our SubCom business saw 10% year-over-year growth, driven by strong execution from the multiple projects it has in force. And as I stated earlier, the value of the programs in force with the new program we just won is approximately $1 billion. And we continue to expect SubCom to grow approximately 20% year-over-year in 2016.", "Our Appliance business sales grew 2% organically, while our Data & Devices business declined 7% (sic) [17%] (13:00) organically, due to both the Circuit Protection sale as well as product exits. We did experience sequential sales growth in the Data & Devices area if you exclude the Circuit Protection divestiture. For the segment, adjusted operating margins expanded 80 basis points year-over-year, as well as 270 basis points sequentially.", "And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mario to cover the financials.", "Mario Calastri - Chief Financial Officer (Interim) & Treasurer", "Thanks, Terrence, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, where I will provide more details on earnings. Adjusted operating income of $501 million was essentially flat to prior year on flat sales, with adjusted operating margin of 16.1%. GAAP operating income was $452 million and included $18 million of acquisition-related charges and net restructuring and other charges of $31 million. Adjusted EPS was $1.08 for the quarter, up 20% from the prior year, with benefits from share buybacks and a lower tax rate of 17%.", "The tax rate was lower than we expected, resulting in an incremental benefit of $0.04 in the quarter. We expect the fourth quarter tax rate to be at a similar level as Q3. Note that the Q3 and Q4 tax rates are lower than our run rate. We now expect the full-year 2016 tax rate to be approximately 20%.", "GAAP EPS was $2.19 for the quarter, driven by a $1.21 benefit, primarily from the settlement of all pre-separation tax disputes with Internal Revenue Service. As we previously disclosed, Tyco International entered into an agreement with the IRS to resolve all disputes related to the previously-disclosed intercompany tax issues.", "As a result, we recognized a reduction of tax reserves of $1.1 billion, as well as an expense of $604 million, representing a reduction in receivables from our tax sharing agreement with Tyco International and Covidien. We're happy to report that all of our IRS legacy tax disputes are now closed.", "As a result of the IRS settlement, want to give you some color on our tax rate and other income going forward. The IRS settlement benefits our tax rate. However, this benefit is essentially offset by the reduction of other income generated by the tax sharing agreement with Tyco and Covidien.", "We now assume that the long-term adjusted tax rate declines to approximately 20%, just as our previously-communicated range of 23% to 24%. At the same time going forward, should assume that the IRS settlement will be essentially neutral to EPS.", "Now, expect approximately $110 million of restructuring charges for the full year, $10 million increase from the prior guidance as we accelerate certain actions due to slightly weaker overall economic conditions.", "Now, turning to Slide 9, our business is executing well in an uncertain micro environment. We are pleased to report sequential improvements in a lot of the operating metrics from the prior quarter. Our adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 33%, in line with our expectations. Adjusted operating margins expanded 20 basis points year-over-year, with a strong focus on spending control and (17:10) improvement of certain declines in higher-margin businesses.", "Total operating expenses were $528 million in the quarter, down 4% from the prior year. We continue to tightly manage discretionary spending, while balancing our continuing investment in our harsh businesses.", "Moving to cash flow, in the quarter, cash from continuing operations was $715 million. And our free cash flow was $589 million, up from prior year levels, due to strong working capital improvement. We saw year-over-year improvement in DSOs and inventory days on hand came down as well.", "We have generated nearly $1 billion in free cash flow for the year to-date, reinforcing the health of our business. And we continue to expect full year free cash flow to approximate net income.", "Adjusted EBITDA margins help explain the (18:12) performance of our businesses, including acquisitions. And adjusted EBITDA margins in Q3 were 20.7%, 460 basis points above adjusted operating margins and flat to prior year. Continue to be pleased with operating performance of our business, especially given the challenging market backdrops.", "As Tom mentioned earlier, we announced an agreement to acquire Intercontec, expanding our harsh connectivity portfolio in the Industrial segment. We are expecting Intercontec to add approximately $75 million of sales and $32 million of EBITDA on an annual basis. The transaction is a cash deal of $340 million that is expected to close in September 2016 and be accretive to adjusted EPS next year. We have added a balance sheet and cash flow summary in the Appendix for additional details.", "And now, I will turn it back to Tom.", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Mario. I'll now cover our guidance, so please turn to Slide 10 for the Q4 outlook. We expect Q4 revenue of $3.25 billion to $3.45 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.17 to $1.23. This guidance includes the extra week we have discussed throughout the year, which adds approximately $200 million of revenue and $0.10 of EPS. Excluding this extra week, we expect revenue to be up about 3% organically at the midpoint and adjusted EPS to be up 22%, a very good finish to our year.", "Slide 10 provides details on actual and organic growth by segment. The extra week results in total growth of 11% in the quarter. We expect strong performance in our harsh businesses, including Automotive, Commercial Transportation, Commercial Aerospace, Medical and Appliances.", "In addition, the Creganna acquisition adds revenue from the high growth interventional medical market, and SubCom continues to remain robust with multiple programs in force. Communications continues to be impacted year-on-year by the sale of the Circuit Protection business and product exits in Data & Devices.", "Now, please turn to Slide 11. For the full year, we expect revenue of $12.25 billion and are reiterating our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $4.00 at the midpoint, up 11% year-on-year. This adjusted EPS outlook is the same guidance we provided back in October. I feel very good about our ability to drive this performance in a slow economy.", "In Transportation, we continue to expect Auto to grow in the mid-single digits organically on a 2% to 2.5% vehicle production growth.", "In Industrial, while organic growth is expected to be down year-over-year for the full year due to the impact of the oil and gas downturn and supply chain corrections in the first half, we do expect strong growth from the first half to the second half across all of our business units in the Industrial segment.", "In Communications, our SubCom business continues to be the primary driver of growth, but we do expect both our Appliances and Data & Devices businesses to grow in the second half. This is especially important for our Data & Devices segment.", "This past quarter was an important threshold for TE and reflects the strength of our model, namely: focus our investments in harsh environment applications; relentlessly drive TEOA through the organization to delivers strong productivity and, as you can see, strong working capital and cash flow results; and consistently execute our capital allocation plan.", "On a normalized 13-week per quarter basis in a low growth world, we are delivering second half revenue growth, 16% adjusted operating margins, strong double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth and outstanding cash flow.", "And with that, let's open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "And today, our first question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "The industrial market, nice to see a little recovery there, but just kind of big picture, how you manage the near-term profitability, which is weak in the current backdrop versus longer term growth expectations, I know you guys have been investing for Industrial, but just help us with kind of the longer-term path and what you see is the appropriate margins for that business longer term?", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I'll take this. It's Tom. I'll ask Terrence to add on when I'm done here. Industrial is an important, obviously, incredibly important segment for us. We're well positioned and, as you can see with the Intercontec acquisition, it's an important area to add in organically as well. It has been a pretty sluggish environment, with the exception of commercial aerospace for the last several years. But it's fundamentally very good business. We still believe this is a business with high teen operating margins, if you get kind of normalized growth over time. And you saw the leverage with a little bit of growth sequentially on our operating margin.", "So, it fits right into the sweet spot of harsh environment, highly engineered products. We have a tremendous range of products. We've expanded that product range, not only in connectors with the recent acquisition, but with our sensor acquisition of a couple years ago. All while those markets are a little soft right now, we continue to be very bullish. So, important market, well-positioned in the market, in every market, so wherever the industrial leaders of the world are, we're there close to them. Terrence, you want to add to that?", "Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director", "Yeah. The only thing I would add, Craig, is we're pretty proud of where we've gotten the margin. And, no, it's not where we want it to be in long-term, but when you think about the oil and gas effect we've had, it's slightly more than 100 basis that we, in a market that is flattish at best, being able to get back and cover that headwind we have. So, clearly that is something that when you look at the margin, has impacted us and that has come down.", "I think also we still have an industrial equipment space that I talked about in the fall, that still, I would say, was probably the other sluggish area that's trying to get momentum. I do think as the volume comes in, you saw the great improvement we have of about 100 basis points sequentially, you see the volume flow through. So, I do think we're doing a good job balancing it. We saw good growth in relationship to Comm air and Defense. 4%, I think we're performing very well there. So, overall, I think we continue to have the same margin expectation we've had, which is higher teen, but clearly, I think we battled through the oil and gas downturn pretty well from a margin perspective.", "Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. And then, if I could, on my follow-up for the medical space, you guys have talked about kind of a system solutions approach, if you will. Can you just talk about the go-to-market there, how it might be different versus the traditional sales approach you have, and then also as it relates to that, what you're able to wring out in terms of value in medical?", "Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director", "I think there's a couple of things to that. When you talk about the go-to-market in medical, it is probably more akin to what we do in automotive. It's a much more direct sale, Craig. So, when you sit there, what's great with Creganna, Creganna not only helped balance out some holes we had geographically, but also with the 200 engineers, they came in to help service that model as well as the footprint that keeps them (26:31) behind. So, I think when you think through that space, it is much more direct.", "Now, when you're deal with more integration, it really is how do we bring the portfolio we had and what they did so well together? And we're early stages on that. But I think that's where you'll get some of the value creation on the grow side is how we'll be able to do further integration and get to a higher content per unit opportunity than either company's had, together.", "So, I think it's much more around bringing the product set together. The go-to-market is how do you make sure you cover the large players in that space. And with what we've had and with Creganna, we cover all the major players and have a nice position with them to get to that leading position.", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I'd add, Craig, that the customer feedback of us being the acquirer has been very positive. Customers knew us peripherally from other things we do, but important to them that somebody with our strength and commitment to the market is there. So, that's been pretty unanimous as we've been out to all the big customers.", "Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. Thanks for all the color.", "Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director", "Thanks, Craig.", "Sujal Shah - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Craig. Could we have the next question, please?", "Operator", "And we do have a question from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Yes. Good morning. And thanks very much for taking the questions. First question is on the Transportation segment. Can you talk about what the reason is that you think you're seeing an improvement in the year-over-year growth rates, excluding the extra week in the Transportation segment, in the fiscal fourth quarter, and if you can offer any views you have about the sustainability of the auto cycle as you move going forward after the September quarter?", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Thanks, Mark. A couple of points, I would say, the fundamental point is the design wins over many years coming into play, so that's been great for us for a long time and continue to expect that to be, so just momentum in design-in share. I think, also last year's fourth quarter wasn't a strong quarter, particularly in China. It was in Europe and in the U.S., but China was in the midst of kind of a three quarter decline. We've seen that recovery in our third quarter this year and expect to see year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. But the bottom line is it's a pretty solid market. We're well-positioned in it. Terrence, you want to add anything to that?", "Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director", "Yeah. No, the only other thing is, I think, when you look at the fourth quarter, fourth quarter, we had some blips earlier in the year around how production was, like Tom said, in China. I think when you look at production, production's been pretty stable and we're at that 2%, 2.5% production rate. And I think that's really just proving our model that we can grow that mid-single digit in a 2% to 2.5% production rate. And while we're not guiding for next year yet, I do think thinking about next year and about a 2% production environment is how we're thinking about it right now, and we'll update you in the fall when we give 2017 guidance.", "Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Very helpful. And for follow-up question on gross margins, they're down year-over-year in each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2016. I know you talked about the mix issues that have been impacting margin. Is there anything else going on with gross margins being down or is it entirely mix?", "Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director", "You're talking, Mark, about Transportation, right?", "Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "For the whole company?", "Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director", "Oh, the whole thing. It's a little bit of the volume in the first half and the mix. But now you can see you get back to this 13-week quarter, $3.1 billion run rate, the margins are back 33%, gross margins. The operating margins are back to 16%. So, no. I mean, our productivity has been good this year.", "The health of the portfolio, I mean, you look at the dramatic improvement in the gross margin over the last several years and the operating margins because of the transformation of the portfolio. So, no, I'd say we're getting back to sort of where we expect to be. And, of course, we expect to continue to improve as long as markets have some growth in them.", "Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thank you.", "Sujal Shah - Vice President-Investor Relations", "All right. Thank you, Mark. Could we have the next question, please?", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yes. Thank you. Good morning. So, Tom, organic growth in Transport, you've noted some strength in China, also EMEA. Can you comment a little bit on the state of the North American market? I think you alluded to it being a little bit softer. How do you see that progressing? And are you accounting for any softness in your outlook in European autos, particularly post-Brexit? And I have a follow up.", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Wamsi. Yeah. Just to kind of reiterate the regional view of Transportation: China improving in Q3, and expect to see that continue in Q4; Europe, sort of been on a steady track for a couple years now, steady, reasonable growth; and the U.S. falling a bit, but at a high level, I mean, so you get near this 18 million per unit level, I do think it slowed down a little bit as you see what the OEMs are saying. So, we have factored that in to our outlook for sure in Q4. We haven't really factored in any Brexit. Of course, we are so close to the auto OEMs and talk with them all the time and right now, I mean, even if you look at our first three weeks, order rates in Transportation in July, they're very, very robust.", "So, not crazy hot, but up over last year, as we expected, nicely and continuing to where they've been in the, as Terrence laid out in his comments earlier, a strong third quarter. And just to reiterate, I think the industry and what we see, listening to our customers, and it's still early, and we'll get more specific next quarter, but kind of feels like a 2% production rate if we had to put the gauntlet down right now for next year globally.", "Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. Thanks for the incremental color. And then, thanks for calling out the impact of that actually so clearly in fiscal 4Q. I was wondering how should we think about seasonality going into the first quarter of next year. If you ex-out the $200 million, consensus is roughly down 3%. It was down 5% last year. But you obviously have made a lot of portfolio changes here and some other M&A here as well. So how should we really be thinking about the seasonality going into first quarter of next year? Thanks.", "Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director", "Okay, Wamsi, I'll take that. It's Terrence. I think when you think about the seasonality, last year, we had some inventory corrections that started fourth quarter of the fiscal year, well into the first quarter. I think when we look at those corrections being behind us, I think you can expect taking our quarter four, backing out the extra week and then assuming anywhere from a 3% to 5% normal seasonal step-down. So, I do think you get into on a top-line perspective much more of normal seasonal quarter four to quarter one. As you're thinking about it, but you highlighted it well, you do have to pull the extra week out of our fourth quarter.", "Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Makes sense.", "Sujal Shah - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you. All right, thanks, Wamsi. Could we have the next question, please?", "Operator", "And we do have a question from the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks. Good morning, guys. I have two questions as well. So, just looking at the guide for September maybe within Transportation, you guys are looking for, I think, 7%, 8% growth, excluding the extra week in the Transportation segment in September. Your orders, though, I think, are up 2% based on the June quarter number. So, can you just maybe help me understand the delta between orders up 2% and the guide that you have? What else could drive the upside there?", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We, you have the ongoing backlog, Amit. And as I said a minute ago, the orders continue into July to be really, really solid. And you have to think of there was inventory correction last year that especially affected China. So, you have some of that normalizing, so you don't have the normal just linear quarter-to-quarter, my Q3 orders equals my Q4 sales. But when you look at our backlog right now and the way it's scheduled out and the rate of orders, it's a solid Q4. Terrence, you want to add to that?", "Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director", "No. I think what you see is you will see a little bit of a seasonal step-down like we normally get around Europe, so I actually think we're getting back to a more normal pattern, Amit, and feel very good with the backlog, as you said, Tom, that the backlog's there to deliver on that 7%, 8% growth (35:20).", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Got it. And I guess if I could just follow-up, Terrence, on the Industrial side, you had some nice margin improvement in the quarter, but you have always talked about Industrial getting in line to corporate average margins, 16%, 17%, let's just say. How do you think the path is there for the next 300 basis points of margin expansion? Is there an absolute revenue number that you need to achieve? And are there incremental cost take out that you would call out that should help you out as well?", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think number one, Amit, we have been doing cost take-out as we've been in a slow environment to really get to where we've been, to keep it flat even with the higher margin oil and gas impact we've had.", "I do think what's nice about the Industrial business, and you saw it sequentially, is how strong the follow-through can be in that business across the segment. So, when you sit there it is much around volume as we continue to march up because a lot of the cost actions have already been effectuated, so it will be much more volume dependent as we go from there.", "Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director", "I think with that, Amit, is when you disaggregate a bit: you've got Commercial air and Defense above; you've got Energy a little bit below; Medical moving up with the acquisitions because that's accretive to the margin; and then, you have the Industrial Equipment business that's really been the factory floor has been a flat market for a couple years, but it's fundamentally a really tight business and the business we just added in, which is a nice add to the product line and into the revenue as well, is accretive to the margin. So, we feel pretty confident that with reasonable industrial production, we'll follow that, and also embedded in there is significant piece of the business that goes through the channel, which is attractive business.", "Sujal Shah - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Okay, thank you, Amit. Can we have the next question, please?", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research Company. Please go ahead.", "Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC", "Hi. Good morning, everybody.", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Morning.", "Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC", "What I wanted to drill in on, I guess, was the restructuring, looking I guess now for $110 million this year. What would be the savings that you'll see in fiscal 2016? And how much of that spills into 2017? And I guess any comment there in terms of how you would think about incremental restructuring actions in 2017. Are you finished or there are other things that need to be tidied up?", "Mario Calastri - Chief Financial Officer (Interim) & Treasurer", "Yes, Shawn. Hi, this is Mario. We have increased slightly the restructuring for this year up to $110 million. The way you should read it is normally the payback is around 18 months, two years. So, you should think about the benefits in 2017 to see on that basis.", "And as far as pipeline of restructuring activity into 2017, we're going to be much more clear in next quarter with the guidance, but you should expect some level of obligation for (38:26) 2017 as well.", "Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Thank you. As a follow-up maybe for you, Tom or Terrence, M&A activity, I don't know if it's just timing, but it's stepped up now, three acquisitions over the past two quarters. Is the environment for M&A freeing up? I know valuations aren't cheap or is there just, given the shift in the portfolio to harsh environment just more resources being put toward M&A, so we should expect maybe a more consistent cadence of M&A over the next few years?", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Shawn, thanks. Good question. I think this, three in this short period of time, is more coincidence than anything else honestly, because just to give you a little of the history. Intercontec, we've been, like we often do and is often the case with a really nice privately held company, it takes a while to work through it. And in this case, we actually did some market experiments, I would say, over a couple years to prove to both of us, both parties, that there was synergy and it was great. So, that's been in the works for awhile.", "Jaquet, the sensor is a fragmented market. And there's always small sensor companies, most of which we're not interested in. That was a much shorter train. (39:46)", "And I would say Creganna was shorter than normal, but part of the plan once we had done advanced cast (39:53), so they happened to come in to these three months. Would have had our druthers, Intercontec would have been a couple of years ago. But sometimes, that's how they work out. So, I don't think the universe of properties or the availability has changed that much. Terrence, if you want to add some color to that...?", "Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director", "No, Tom, I think you said it right. I think it is some of these things, when something gets auctioned like a Creganna, we don't control that top box (40:20). And then Intercontec, it was a journey with the owner about also when's he comfortable selling and making sure he sees how his company's going to do well. (40:32) I think that takes time. So, I do think it's a little bit of three things at once. So, it's just that, Shawn.", "I think when you look at the environment, I think the environment \u2013 you said it very well. I think things are still \u2013 you have to pay for good assets. And I think we have three good assets here. And that's along our harsh strategy. I think the harsh strategy, we've talked about interventional a lot over the past six months, but I think when you also look here, Jaquet and the sensors, how it strengthens us in automotive, especially in turbo sensor applications.", "And I think when you look at Intercontec, what's great about Intercontec, is it gets us closer to the factory floor. They're a leader in that space that really relates to the how do you hook up servo motors on the factory floor, which is a very harsh application, and you make sure your power and your signal into the application is controlled now (41:25) to make sure you never have downtime. And the company has an exceptional product line and technology that we're bringing in that was a gap for TE.", "So, I think each one of these show how our thought about the portfolio continues to evolve around harshness as well as how do we serve our customers better with a more complete portfolio. So, I think that's what really the three of these being together at the same time. You get to see how we're thinking. So, hopefully, that helps.", "Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC", "It does. Thanks, Terrence.", "Sujal Shah - Vice President-Investor Relations", "All right. Thank you, Shawn. Can we have the next question, please?", "Operator", "And our next comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Please go ahead.", "Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC", "Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple of specific questions on some of the results, first of all, the Appliance business, it sounded like it's experienced some decent growth. Can you just talk about what's driving some of that growth in a little bit more specific? And then secondly, you talked about organic growth ex-Creganna. I was just curious what kind of growth you've seen from Creganna out of the box with that business. And then I had a quick follow-up.", "Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director", "Sure, Steve. It's Terrence. Thanks for the questions. First off, on Appliance, what we've seen in Appliance, Appliance has been \u2013 they got impacted a little bit around the inventory correction with our channel partners, because they do have part of their business goes through there but if you really look at what we've been experiencing, we've been experiencing a very robust U.S. and Europe production environment. So, I think we're seeing nice growth there that's been the backdrop. What we have had in Appliance is that the China OEMs have slowed in China.", "So, the appliance production in China has come off a little bit. So, while we were growing 2%, it's really been driven by the U.S. and Europe. We see it again here in the quarter we just guided to, and going into next year, we probably expect a similar picture.", "On Creganna, certainly, we didn't own it a year ago, but in this first quarter, if we did own it, it would have grown about 11%. So, when we look at that interventional market, as we've talked to you, we see a market that we like it very much because of the trend that supports about mid to higher single digit market environment in that interventional space, that $3 billion market, that Creganna helps us get a leadership position in, but really a good first quarter that, on a pro forma, we owned them a year ago, would have been up about 11%.", "Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC", "Great. It's helpful. And then, just real quick on the SubCom business, given the growth you're seeing, where are we versus prior cycle margins? And can you talk to how margins have improved recently and how they may improve in the next couple quarters? Thanks.", "Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director", "The margins are similar and we're seeing margins gradually move up. So, it's following the same general pattern. None of the patterns are exactly the same, but, yes, we are seeing margins now are higher than they were on a one year run rate than they were a year ago. So, we are seeing that happen.", "Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC", "Thanks very much.", "Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director", "Thank you.", "Sujal Shah - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Steve. Can we have the next question, please?", "Operator", "And we do have a question from the line of Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead.", "James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thank you and congratulations to you and your team.", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks.", "James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Could you briefly \u2013 you mentioned about, I believe it was automotive from Brexit did not have a impact. Can you just make sure? Did I get that right? And then, what about your other segments? Did you see any impact post the quarter close from Brexit? And then, my follow-up just to kind of throw it in at the same time is on the tax rate. It ended up this year, I think, lower than everyone expected, so it helped out your earnings as you're reiterating guidance. So, was it the industrial market that kind of the profitability came in softer or what was the cause that even though earnings reiterated guidance and you have more M&A, the tax rate really helped out this year? And longer term, are we looking at a lower tax rate? How should we plan tax rate longer term? Thank you.", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So, let me start with your Brexit question, Jim. Thanks for the comments, by the way. Yeah, it's hard to feel any impact right now. I mean, as I said, you can look at our orders right up to last week, they're running what we based this guidance on and slightly ahead of the run rate last quarter and nicely ahead of the run rate last year. And Europe continues to be really solid kind of across most of our businesses. So we haven't really seen any impact yet. So, like I guess like everybody else in the planet, we're waiting to see if there's really going to be an impact or not.", "On the tax rate, Mario, you want to?", "Mario Calastri - Chief Financial Officer (Interim) & Treasurer", "Yeah. Just begin with (46:20) a comment around our long-term tax rate view is now around 20%, down from where we communicated previously, which we were around 23% to 24%. Currently, the settlement, the IRS settlement, is the biggest moving piece here. As you think about that, you need to combine it with the SG, (46:46) the other income going away. So that is why we characterize it as a kind of an EPS neutral movement.", "Now, for 2016 in the second half, we are experiencing a lower than run rate tax rate. So, in Q3, we had the 17% tax rate. We expect Q4 to be similar", "James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Great. Thanks for the details and especially for pointing out the other income line fluctuates with the tax rate. I think some people often (47:23) struggle with that. Thank you. And, again, congratulations to you and your team at TE Connectivity.", "Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director", "Thanks, Jim.", "Sujal Shah - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Jim. Can we have the next question, please?", "Operator", "And we do have a question from the line of William Stein with SunTrust. Please go ahead.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Great. Thanks for taking my question. Gentlemen, I think, Terrence, you mentioned sort of a preview on auto production for next year. And, Tom, you might have reiterated that view. I'm curious whether the China stimulus that's been in place since last September, and it's so therefore about to annualize, how that factors in to your view of global production, if at all, and why shouldn't that drag global unit growth more?", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Will. Yeah. Well, I think what we certainly saw as the stimulus helped reverse the decline that was happening early in the year. So, we returned to growth in \u2013 nice solid growth in Q3 and we'll see that again in Q4 in Auto. And all the numbers from the industry are, of course, very preliminary for next year, but they're assuming a reasonable China market next year, not a booming market, not a bearish market. That's kind of how we see it and what our leadership over there sees. So, I don't think \u2013 we don't expect an unusually positive catalyst from it because it's really already into the base is the way I would think about it.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Tom, to clarify, what I'm asking is the stimulus for consumers for taxes in automotive, that's been in place since last September. So as that annualizes, is there not an expectation that China is going to be a more difficult market next year?", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No. Okay. Well, it's hard to say. But, again, if you think of this year being 2% to 2.5%, next year being in the 2% range, other markets were kind of weak. Some of the Asian markets were inconsistent. It really depends. Is China is going to come off? I mean, if you look at macro China, where the weakness has been is in industrial China, not consumer China. The consumer markets in China and the consumer in China continues to be pretty healthy. And the growth in the China economy is in the consumer market, which is a good thing in general because that's what fuels economic growth and then eventually feeds the industrial part of the economy. So, I think we don't have a crystal ball, for sure, Will.", "But right now, what we're seeing is \u2013 we would expect reasonable growth in China, definitely down from what it's run over \u2013 take our fiscal 2016 out of it because growth in fiscal 2016 is pretty modest. I think we kind of see another modest growth in fiscal 2017. It's below the historical growth rates. And that's how you get to this 1.5%, 2% production growth in 2017. But I think this will play out. But generally, we're not hearing or seeing anything from our customers and from our patterns that would say differently right now. It was better in the third quarter than we thought; probably a little better in the third quarter and a little less in fourth quarter. We saw the curve being a little bit different in the second half, but, overall, it's about where we expect.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay.", "Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director", "Just to add one thing, when we look to the 2% next year, we'll guide more next quarter. It does assume a slower China production environment versus this year's China production environment. So, we do anticipate it'll be a little slower environment in China from a production perspective due to the 1.6-liter engine that you talked about.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Yeah.", "Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director", "But we still expect the China production environment to grow next year based upon what we're seeing today.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "That perspective is very helpful. I appreciate it. If I can squeeze one more in, your military and aerospace end markets seem to have done well in the quarter. I'm wondering if the DoD budget and the end of sequestration, is that helping or is this more sort of unrelated to that? And then in aerospace, I think we've had some negative data points from Boeing and Airbus on the wide-body jets. And I'm wondering if whether your results and outlook are doing well despite that because of growth elsewhere or are you just not seeing that weakness yet? Thank you.", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Will, thanks for the question. A couple of things, on Commercial Aerospace, feel very good with the program wins and even if you have some of the wide-body adjustment, we do view that our Commercial Aerospace business would grow that mid-single digit with the platforms we have won; not only with the big carriers, also the regional carriers like Embraer and Bombardier (52:46), and so forth. And so, I actually feel very good even with those data points you mentioned about.", "I think in Defense, it's been nice that as we've seen some of the budgetary things happen, we're starting to see some pick-up in Defense. I think you saw that in our quarterly results where we grew 4%. And I think that's creating a little bit more of a constructive backdrop in Defense than we've had in quite some time when the whole sequester started. So, it's actually nice to see it burning (53:14) into revenue on the Defense side. And I think the momentum we have there is strong as well. So, those are areas that I view you're going to continue to see growth out of (53:20).", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Thanks very much.", "Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director", "Thank you.", "Sujal Shah - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?", "Operator", "And we do have a question from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Please go ahead.", "Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yes. Thanks and good morning. Just a couple from me here, regarding the Sensor business and the fact that it hasn't been growing here, and I understand the industrial weakness that you've seen. It sounds like you're talking about some increase in bookings. So could you update us on when you expect that to grow? And on the automotive side, the cross-selling, I know it takes two to three years in terms of these design cycles, but when do you expect, Tom, to see the payoff on the automotive side of things?", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I think, Matt, automotive, as you know, the cycle is a little bit longer, not as long as it used to be because everybody's designing faster these days, but I would say 2018. That's when these nice wins are going to really start to come in. And you'll see it in the Auto revenue line.", "In the Industrial line, I think it will follow kind of industrial production. The design win nature there is very different. It's like the industrial market in general, much more fragmented, smaller revenue per design. So, in there, it'll continue to build scale in the non-auto products and make sure that they we're growing with or slightly better than the market.", "But auto is where you can get significant chunks of business per design. So, we really feel good about that. Now, we're a little disappointed in the industrial market side of it. But still very, very excited about the prospects of having sensors in the portfolio and what it does for us at every customer, every big OEM, we've always had a nice seat at the table, but it's like you get a bigger seat and sometimes a bigger table because it brings in the integrated solution opportunity.", "You've heard us talk about that. We've had some tremendous design wins in Automotive with that. And it's starting to lend itself, I think, to the aerospace market. Terrence has talked before about the medical market when you pull together our interventional capability along with our core connector healing and protect, (55:45) and, wow, miniaturized sensors. So, it's a pretty robust portfolio that we have that should bolster our growth rates in Industrial.", "Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And just on the follow-up, could you update us on the CFO search?", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Well into it, as you would expect, and I expect in the not too distant future, we'll be making a choice. Always not over till it's over, but pleased with how things are running in the interim, very pleased, so haven't really skipped a beat.", "Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Sujal Shah - Vice President-Investor Relations", "All right. Thank you, Matt. Could we have the next question, please?", "Operator", "We do have a question from the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie Group. Please go ahead.", "Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Hi. Good morning. Your acquisition strategy clearly has been focused on the harsh environment side, in Industrial and Auto. Curious if can you comment about if there's anything in the consumer area that you're looking in your pipeline or if there's further opportunities to divest pieces of that and just an update on your strategy with product exits, has that been working in terms of the margin improvement?", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Thanks. Well, you're absolutely right that the acquisition strategy is focused on harsh environments. And there's a lot of opportunity there. It's our wheelhouse, and it's where we can bring the most value to customers. So, that's where we're exclusively focused on our M&A at this point in time.", "I would say that shifting over to the Data & Devices business to add on to what Terrence said, feeling good about the progress and the fact that we're going to see sequential growth in the fourth quarter for the first time in a long time. Restructuring getting behind us, the margins moving up, we definitely see this business is getting on the improvement path, so encouraged about that.", "We have to earn that one quarter at a time, so we're not getting carried away here, but the team's done a lot of hard work to reposition the business around our core connector capability, which is still very good, and very good products with attractive margins.", "And as far as your point on the product exits, it'll probably blend in a little bit early next year. (58:15) Terrence, you want to comment on that?", "Terrence R. Curtin - President & Director", "Yeah. I think on the exits, Mario talked about it earlier to a question. Certainly, they've been a drag for the past two years. We see those probably through mid-2017 still being a little drag. But when you look at it, it's really allowed the business to get focused, as Tom said, around the interconnect and connectivity strength that we have, as well as we're much more selective in the consumer space. So, a lot of those exits have related to the consumer space, and making sure we're still consuming (58:45) our resources where we create value for our customers, as well as our shareholders.", "Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay. And as a follow-up, has there been any slippage or impact from the recent move up in commodity prices like copper and gold? Thank you.", "Mario Calastri - Chief Financial Officer (Interim) & Treasurer", "This is Mario. Not really, I mean, we have a hedging program that basically dilutes the volatility around the battles (59:12). Consistently, we are about 50% hedged. And we have higher hedges on the near term, so you're not going to see much of an impact on copper. (59:22)", "Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Thank you.", "Sujal Shah - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Mike. Could we have the next question, please?", "Operator", "And we do have a question from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi. Tom, I wanted to ask, you guys have been switching some of the business around with acquisitions and divestitures over the past couple of years. How do you feel about the portfolio right now? Do you think you have the right mix of business? Is there any opportunity to do additional divestitures at this point?", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sherri, thanks. No, I feel really, really good about the portfolio. As you know, it had quite a bit in it at one point in time and now we're up to the, say, 90% is connectivity and sensors. We often get asked about SubCom. It's an unusual business, for sure. There really isn't that much of a market. There's no market really that we've seen in 10 years to sell it, but it's an exceptionally well-run business that's a clear world leader in what it does.", "And it's especially interesting these days, because the customer base is different. And with cloud computing and mega data centers and fiber security and all those things driving what we think fit the needs for more trans-continental connectivity, SubCom can hold its own in our portfolio. But when you get past that, everything else is related. So, more of what you'd see is tweaking the product lines, which you always have in a business as you try, hey, (1:00:56) here's a product line that maybe is commoditized, that we don't have any unique value. Let's price ourselves out of it or maybe sell it. But for the most part, the most recent one being Circuit Protection, was kind of the big chunks that are available.", "Never say never, but really like the portfolio, I think you can see it in the margins. The harsh businesses, if you look at those business, above company average margins, nicely, very dependable, highly engineered, really play to our strength as an engineering and manufacturing company. And, as Terrence pointed out, with the acquisitions we just made, we just added $0.5 billion of harsh revenue into the portfolio over the last 90 days and at EBITDA margins well above the company average. And this is what we know best and do best, so it's what we're going to continue to emphasize.", "Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay, great. And then, just in terms of an update on the buybacks, I think you're mostly done with the buybacks related to the BNS divestiture. Can you give us an update on your thoughts on buybacks? I think you have about $1.2 billion left at this point? Thanks.", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Mario, you want to comment on that?", "Mario Calastri - Chief Financial Officer (Interim) & Treasurer", "Sure. Long-term, it's consistent with what we have communicated always. We expect to basically return two-thirds of our free cash flow through buybacks and dividends. So, you can do the math clearly, but the long-term expectation there should be some volatility around the quarters.", "As far as Q4 specifically, you should expect it to be similar to Q3.", "Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Sherri.", "Mario Calastri - Chief Financial Officer (Interim) & Treasurer", "Thank you, Sherri.", "Sujal Shah - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Sherri. Looks like there's no further questions.", "Sujal Shah - Vice President-Investor Relations", "So, please contact Investor Relations at TE if you have additional questions. And thank you for joining us this morning and have a great day.", "Thomas J. Lynch - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks everybody, and have a good summer.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, today's conference will be available for a replay after 10:30 AM today through July 27.", "You may access the AT&T teleconference replay system at any time by dialing 1-800-475-6701 and entering the access code 396124.

LLC", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Q4 2016 TE Connectivity Earnings Call. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Sujal Shah. Please go ahead.", "Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's fourth quarter and full year 2016 results. With me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch; President, Terrence Curtin; and Chief Financial Officer, Heath Mitts.", "During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information, and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning, and we ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that addresses the use of these items. The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com.", "Finally, for participants on the Q&A portion of today's call, I would like to remind everyone to limit themselves to one follow-up question to make sure we are able to cover all questions during the allotted time.", "Now let me turn the call over to Tom for opening comments.", "Thomas J. Lynch - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thanks for joining us today. I'm going to review the highlights of Q4 and the full year and preview fiscal 2017 guidance, then I'll turn it over to Terrence to cover our performance in more detail. Before I get started, one more reminder that our fourth quarter included 14 weeks this year.", "Please turn to slide three. Fiscal 2016 was a very good year for TE. I'm especially pleased with our Q4 results which included record adjusted earnings per share above the high end of our guidance and record free cash flow. We also finished the year with strong orders, setting us up for a good start to our 2017 fiscal year. A key takeaway is that on both a 13-week and 14-week basis, the company had a very good fourth quarter, exceeding our guidance in earnings and expectations in cash flow.", "Sales for the full 14-week quarter were $3.3 billion, essentially at the midpoint of our guidance. Excluding the extra week, sales grew 4% and 2% organically. Adjusted EPS was $1.27 on a 14-week basis, $0.07 better than the midpoint of our guidance. On a 13-week basis, adjusted EPS was $1.14, up 27% over the prior year, and as I mentioned, a new record for us.", "Orders of $2.95 billion were up 11% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially excluding the extra week and our SubCom business. Adjusted operating margin was 16.5% and free cash flow was approximately $600 million.", "We continue to execute our harsh strategy with the completion of acquisition of Intercontec at the end of the quarter, adding a very nice range of connectivity products to our Industrial Solutions product portfolio. We also continue to execute very well in the SubCom business with the October announcement that TE was awarded the new Pacific Light Cable Network, a trans-Pacific system where TE is working with Google and Facebook. Q4 was a very good quarter and momentum is strong as we enter fiscal 2017.", "Now please turn to slide four. We were able to beat our guidance and deliver double digit adjusted EPS growth despite a slower-than-expected economic environment. This is a good indicator of the multiple levers we have to drive performance.", "Our harsh businesses continue to perform well. SubCom had an excellent year and we made several key acquisitions including Creganna, which established us as a leader in the market for minimally-invasive medical solutions, Jaquet which expanded our sensor position in the transportation market, and Intercontec which I mentioned earlier. We also sold our Circuit Protection business to narrow our focus in the Communication segment.", "From a financial perspective, sales were $12.24 billion; adjusted EPS was $4.08, $0.08 above our original guidance; and free cash flow exceeded our expectations at $1.6 billion.", "We maintained strong operating margins of 15.8% for the full year with operating margins in the 16%-plus range in the second half. Adjusted EBITDA margins remained strong at 20.6% in a very low growth market. We also returned $3.1 billion to shareholders in dividends and stock buybacks.", "Now I'll take a minute to highlight our fiscal 2017 guidance. We expect revenue of $12.3 billion to $12.9 billion, which represents total growth of 5% and organic growth of 3% at midpoint using a 52-week baseline in fiscal 2016. We expect adjusted EPS of $4.19 to $4.49, representing 10% growth at midpoint and another year of double digit EPS growth when compared to the 52-week base of $3.95 in 2016.", "Before we move on, I wanted to recognize that this is the first earnings call since our announcement that Terrence Curtin will become CEO in March. I couldn't be more confident about the choice of Terrence. I also want to welcome Heath Mitts who joined us as CFO a couple of months ago. Heath is getting up to speed very quickly and will be a strong partner for Terrence.", "Now I'll pass it over to Terrence and he will review our performance in more detail.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thanks, Tom. And good morning, everyone. Before we get into the segment results and updates, I'd like to cover our orders for the quarter, which will help provide the foundation for the trends that we're seeing in our business as well as our expectations for 2017.", "If you could please turn to slide five, and this shows our order trends on both a 13 and 14-week basis excluding our SubCom business. I'll speak to our orders on a 13-week basis so you have an apples-to-apples comparison versus last year and last quarter.", "Orders were up 11% year-over-year and our book-to-bill was 1.03. On a sequential basis, we saw 1% growth which is stronger than normal seasonality as we typically experience a slight sequential decline. So we're clearly pleased with the order momentum as we enter into 2017.", "Geographically, we saw order growth in all regions on an organic basis. The strength overall was driven by Asia, both in China, as well as outside of China, with order growth of 22%. Europe and the Americas orders grew approximately 3%, and those regions remain steady with continued growth in orders.", "From a segment perspective, in Transportation, orders increased 15% year-over-year and were up 3% sequentially as China auto OEMs increased production ahead of the expiration of government incentives at the end of the calendar year.", "Industrial segment orders grew 15% year-over-year due to the Creganna acquisition, and on an organic order basis, they grew 4% with growth across each of our three Industrial businesses. Sequentially, Industrial orders declined in line with typical seasonality.", "In the Communications segment, excluding SubCom, we saw sequential growth of 4% driven by both our Appliances and Data/Device businesses. In Data and Devices, we are seeing increasing momentum in the business as product exits are largely behind us. And year-over-year orders were up if you exclude the impact from the sale of our Circuit Protection business.", "Now let me spend a minute on SubCom, as this business continues its strong momentum. As Tom mentioned, we were recently named as the supplier of trans-Pacific system with Google and Facebook, and with $1 billion of backlog, we expect SubCom to grow again in 2017.", "Please turn to slide six to discuss the segment results, and let me kick it off with our Transportation segment. Segment sales grew 5% organically in the quarter on a 13-week basis, with strong growth in Auto and Commercial Transportation. This was offset by weakness in Sensors that was driven by industrial-related markets like we've talked about the past few quarters.", "Our Auto sales in the quarter were up 6%, in line with our expectations and ahead of auto production growth of 3% during the quarter due to content gains. Growth was driven by strength in Asia and in Europe partially offset by declines in North America.", "Going forward, we continue to expect our Auto business to grow ahead of auto production, driven by electronic content growth and a rich pipeline of platform ramps from design wins that we generated over the past several years.", "In our Commercial and Transportation business, we delivered very strong performance with organic growth of 4% year-over-year despite a very challenging end market in North America. Our performance was driven by strength in China and Europe, and this was partially offset by declines in North America.", "Turning to Sensors, we saw overall growth of 4% that was driven by the acquisition of Jaquet. We did see a 2% organic decline as we continue to be impacted by the weaknesses in the industrial-related markets, which make up more than half of our sensor sales.", "We continue to see strong design win momentum in the automotive space for sensor applications and expect to begin to see meaningful revenue from these programs beginning in fiscal 2018.", "Adjusted operating margins in the segment were 19.6% and were in line with our expectations and were up sequentially 20 basis points. For the full year, the segment delivered 5% organic growth and 19.2% adjusted operating margins.", "If you could please turn to slide seven, let me move over to the Industrial Solutions segment. On an overall basis, segment sales were up 16% year-over-year due to the acquisition of Creganna. On a 13-week organic basis, revenue in the segment declined 2% driven by weakness in the Oil and Gas and an overall slow Industrial Equipment environment. Geographically, we continue to see North America as weak, Europe as stable and China improving.", "I'll provide some color now on sales growth in our industrial businesses and this'll be on a 13-week basis. In the Industrial Equipment area, we saw 15% growth driven by the Creganna acquisition, which is performing ahead of our expectations. We continue to be excited about the growth potential in this minimally-invasive medical market. On a pro forma basis, if we had owned Creganna this time last year, our growth would have been greater than 10%.", "Excluding Creganna, the Industrial Equipment business declined 7% organically with softness in all regions but did show first half to second half growth of 7% as markets recovered from the first half inventory correction that we talked about earlier in the year.", "In the Aerospace & Defense area, we had strong growth of 6% organically, driven by share gains in both commercial air platforms and defense applications.", "In Oil and Gas, similar to prior quarters, our sales declined by 27% due to the end market conditions in that area.", "And finally, our Energy business had a very nice growth of 6% organically with growth both in China as well as in the Americas.", "From a margin perspective, adjusted operating margins were in line with expectations but down year-over-year. The year-over-year decline is due entirely to the Oil and Gas business, which impacted segment operating margins by approximately 100 basis points year-over-year due to the revenue declines that we saw in that business. We do expect the oil and gas impact to our margins to affect our comparisons to the first quarter of 2017 but then they'll be anniversaried as we get later into the year.", "For the full year, the Industrial Solutions segment delivered 1% actual growth and 12.3% adjusted operating margins. Organically, the segment sales declined 3% for the full year but did grow 11% from the first half to second half following the inventory corrections that I mentioned that we experienced in the first two quarters.", "So, if you could please turn to slide eight, let me cover Communications Solutions. During the quarter, the Communications segment revenue was down 1% organically on a 13-week basis. The SubCom business saw 13% year-over-year growth driven by strong execution from multiple projects that we have in force. For the full year, SubCom grew 25% in fiscal 2016. In Appliances on a 13-week basis, our business grew 3% organically while Data and Devices declined 13% organically due to the effects of product exits. What was nice about Data and Devices, we did experience another quarter of sequential sales growth in the business in quarter four as the product exits are largely behind us.", "Adjusted operating margin for the segment expanded 180 basis points sequentially and 240 basis points year-over-year due to the productivity improvements and restructuring actions we've taken in the segment. For the full year 2016, Communications Solutions declined 2% organically driven by Data and Devices and generated 11.6% adjusted operating margins.", "Now let me hand it over to Heath who will cover the financials.", "Heath A. Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thank you, Terrence. And good morning, everyone. To start off, I'm excited to join the TE team here and I look forward to getting to know the investor and analyst community over the coming quarters.", "Now if you'd please turn to slide nine, I'll provide more details on our Q4 earnings. Adjusted operating income was $551 million with an adjusted operating margin of 16.5%. Excluding the extra week, our adjusted operating margin was 16%. Note that the operating income impact from the additional week was $55 million.", "GAAP operating income was $517 million and included $30 million of restructuring charges driven primarily by Data and Devices and $4 million of acquisition-related charges.", "Adjusted EPS was $1.27 for the quarter. If you exclude the $0.13 contribution from the additional week, adjusted EPS was $1.14 and up 27% year-on-year, a new company record. The growth above prior year was driven by an increase in operating income, incremental benefits from share buyback, and a lower adjusted effective tax rate of 13%. The adjusted tax rate was lower than prior guidance due to the mix of profitability by region and statute expirations in certain jurisdictions.", "GAAP EPS was $1.22 for the quarter and included restructuring and acquisition-related charges of $0.05. For full year 2016, restructuring charges were $125 million, and I expect similar levels for 2017, driven primarily by activity in our industrial-related and acquired businesses.", "Due to the benefit from the settlement of all pre-separation tax disputes with the Internal Revenue Service that was discussed last quarter, we ended 2016 with a full-year GAAP income tax benefit of $779 million and an adjusted effective tax rate of 18.5% for the full year. I expect a full-year adjusted effective tax rate of 20% for 2017.", "Now if you'll turn to slide 10, our business is performing well in a challenging economic environment driven by the resiliency of our harsh portfolio and the execution of the TE Operating Advantage program or TEOA. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 33.2%, a 70% [sic] 0.7% improvement from prior year driven by productivity improvements across the segments. Adjusted operating margins were 16.5% in the quarter, and going forward into 2017, we continue to manage our business tightly and will continue to invest for future growth in our harsh businesses.", "Adjusted EBITDA margins help explain the profitability performance of our business including acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA margins in Q4 were strong at 20.9%, which was up 20 basis points sequentially.", "In the quarter, we had strong performance with cash flow from continuing operations of $782 million and free cash flow of $594 million, up a strong 53% from prior year. The growth was driven by significant improvements in working capital, and again, is reflective of the team's solid execution.", "For the full year, I'm pleased to report that we generated nearly $1.6 billion of free cash flow, signaling a very healthy business. Looking ahead, we continue to expect free cash flow to approximate net income and capital expenditures to be approximately 5% of revenue. We remain committed to our disciplined long-term capital strategy of a balanced return of free cash flow to shareholders while still having ample free cash flow available for acquisitions.", "In 2016, we returned $3.1 billion to our shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. Our balance sheet remains strong with reasonable debt levels and an ability to continue to support the return of capital and acquisitions going forward. We have added a balance sheet and cash flow summary in the appendix for additional details.", "And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Terrence.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thanks, Heath. And now I'll cover our guidance for the first quarter and the full year of 2017. So, if you could please turn to slide 11 for the first quarter outlook.", "We expect first quarter revenue of $2.95 billion to $3.05 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.98 to $1.02, representing sales growth of 6% and 3% on an organic basis, and 19% adjusted EPS growth at the midpoint. Following record adjusted EPS and strong orders in the fourth quarter, our guidance represents a strong start to our fiscal 2017.", "By segment, we expect Transportation Solutions to grow mid-single digits both organically and on an actual basis. This is above expected auto production growth levels of 2% in the first quarter, driven by China, as well as Europe. Commercial Transportation growth, we expect to be driven by Asia.", "In the Industrial segment, we expect it to grow double digits overall due to the Creganna and Intercontec acquisitions and will be flat organically, with the weakness in oil and gas market offsetting growth in our Aerospace & Defense business. We expect low single digit organic growth in the Communications segment driven by Appliances and SubCom.", "If you could now turn to slide 12, and I'll cover the full-year guidance. For the full year, we expect revenue in the range of $12.3 billion to $12.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $4.19 to $4.49. This represents 5% overall growth, 3% organic growth and 10% adjusted earnings per share growth at the midpoint versus 52 weeks fiscal 2016 results.", "I feel very good about our ability to drive 3% organic growth and double digit adjusted EPS growth in this challenging economic environment. This is in line with our overall business model and proves that our harsh strategy is delivering while we continue to benefit from the secular trend of content growth across our harsh businesses.", "We expect our Transportation segment to be up mid-single digits organically on 1% global oil production growth next year. And this reflects content growth trends as well as share gains from the programs we've won in the past. Commercial Transportation we expect to outperform its end market again this year, benefiting from content expansion in the heavy truck market. And we expect our Sensors business to grow 7% in total year-over-year.", "In the Industrial segment, we expect it to be up low single digits organically with continued gains in Commercial Aerospace and Defense, momentum in interventional medical applications driving the growth and also stabilization in our Oil and Gas business.", "In the Communications segment, we expect to be up low single digits organically with growth driven by Appliances and SubCom. As I said, momentum in SubCom remains very strong with the $1 billion that we have in backlog, benefiting from the buildout of the cloud, and we expect growth in the mid-single digits in SubCom in 2017.", "Now let me turn it back over to Tom for some closing comments.", "Thomas J. Lynch - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thanks, Terrence. To reiterate, 2016 was a very good year for TE and we're expecting another very good year in 2017 with 5% overall sales growth, 3% organic growth, operating margin expansion and double digit adjusted EPS growth excluding the additional week in 2015.", "Our harsh strategy is definitely delivering, with 80% of our revenue driven by harsh environment applications. These products are highly engineered and developed at the application architecture level, providing a wide moat around our solution. Over the past five years, we have averaged mid-single digit growth across our harsh businesses and have multiple levers to continue to drive margin expansion.", "We have remained active in shaping our portfolio to focus on harsh applications. Over the past year, our acquisitions have given TE a leading position in solutions for the minimally-invasive medical market, expanded our portfolio of industrial connectors, and bolstered our offering of sensors for the auto market.", "At the same time, we returned over $3 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Over time, we have maintained consistency with our capital strategy, returning nearly $12 billion to shareholders since we became a public company nearly 10 years ago. Moving forward, we expect free cash flow to approximate net income and continue to expect to return two-thirds of our free cash flow to shareholders and use one-third for acquisitions.", "While there will be cyclicality, the markets that TE serves have strong underlying secular trends driven by the megatrends of safe, green and connected.", "Using auto as an example, these trends are driving the need for more sensors and connectors to support increased safety features, autonomous driving systems, higher emission standards and infotainment. TE benefits directly from these trends, and this is reflected in our transportation guidance for fiscal 2017 where we expect to grow mid-single digits on 1% auto production growth.", "We see similar drivers in our Industrial and Communications businesses, which will enable us to grow content.", "TE has multiple levers to drive revenue and EPS growth. As the world leader in connectors and sensors, we have unmatched technology and global presence. With over 7,000 engineers, we are setting the pace for new product and technology development and are driving our customers' roadmaps with integrated solutions which TE is uniquely positioned to provide. And all the work we've done over the last several years has translated into each dollar of revenue today is delivering 40% more EPS than five years ago.", "These are very exciting times for TE, and I'm proud of what we have accomplished this year. I'm also very happy that Terrence is succeeding me, as he's been instrumental in establishing TE's global leadership position in connectivity and sensor solutions and strengthening the company's financial performance to drive value for our shareholders. We've prepared Terrence for this role over several years, and I will continue on as Executive Chairman of the Board, making sure this is a seamless transition.", "So, thank you. And now let's open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, I guess I was going to ask you about the threat of Russia hacking a subsea cable, but you guys covered that earlier today. I guess...", "Thomas J. Lynch - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "(27:33)", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "That's your first question.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "I guess the first official question will be, Transportation orders were up rather strong, I think up 25%. Terrence, I think you mentioned that China was the driver for that. So, maybe you could just talk about what the trends look like excluding the China benefit. And would that suggest that maybe this 1% production estimate you have is perhaps more H1 or first half heavy for you guys?", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Amit, I think a couple of things. When we look at the orders, we saw nice orders. I think when you look at Automotive, we saw nice orders in Europe. We also saw very strong orders in Asia. As I mentioned, clearly, China was a big part of it. And North America has been the trends we've been seeing.", "I think when you look at next year and we talk about the 1% production growth, the first quarter we do see 2% production growth, really driven, as we've seen, some acceleration in production in China. And then, I think you're going to see it be more 1% or less for the rest of the year.", "We do think China, when we look at the 1%, is going to be about 3% production growth for the overall year in that 1%. We do expect Europe to sort of be low single digit production growth and North America to be flat when we look at it through next year. So, I think when you look at the first half, you'll see China normalize during the first half of this year is the way we're looking at it, with a little bit stronger in the first quarter.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "That's helpful. And then, I guess, Industrial segment, margins at 13.4% I think were down year-over-year by 40, 50 basis points. Is your mix some part (29:05) of it? But just help us understand, I mean, revenues are obviously much stronger today than they've been before. What gets you to that 15%, 16% op margin ZIP code on that segment? And could you get there by the end of this year?", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "I think when you look at the Industrial segment, as I said in my comments, right now we are being impacted about 100 basis points due to the impact of the oil and gas market. And to frame that for everybody again, our Oil and Gas business went from probably $200 million in 2015 (29:39) down to $125 million in 2016. So, we did have a pretty sharp decline, and that was high-margin business that has impacted the overall segment.", "So, I do feel good we've improved the margins net of that effect, if you remove that effect, and we do expect margin expansion next year in this segment. I don't think we're going to get up to 15% next year, to your question, because we still have a pretty low organic growth in that segment. And that growth is going to be driven by Aerospace & Defense, certainly in the medical space, and we're also going to need some more volume to get up towards that 15%. But we have been doing cost actions and do expect the margin to improve next year and to be a contributor for total TE margin expansion.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Perfect. That's it for me. Thank you, guys.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thanks.", "Thomas J. Lynch - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thank you.", "Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thanks, Amit. Could we have the next question, please?", "Operator", "Next is the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yes. Thank you. Good quarter. And congrats, Heath, on the new role. As we look at autos here, I mean, if we look at 2016 for the full year, there was 2% to 2.5% production growth, you guys did about 3.4% growth organic in autos. Your guidance here inarguably \u2013 which is prudent given the weakness that we're seeing across different regions -- of 1% production growth is implying a 5% growth in transport.", "So, could you help sort of talk a little bit maybe in a little bit more detail around some of the share gains and increased comp and drivers that you sort of alluded to on the call which gives you confidence that you can bridge this wider gap of almost four points incremental growth from a content perspective? And I have a follow-up.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Sure. Thank you for the question. Actually, when you look at it, earlier in this year, as we covered, there were some supply chain corrections that we had in China early in the year, as well as North America sort of middle of the year. And now that we're in a pretty stable environment to where we're at today from a production. I think you're going to see that content growth to that separation. And it is around both content and share gain, Wamsi. It's not one or the other.", "And I think you've seen that both in our fourth quarter, you've seen that separation come back from our growth rate in a pretty stable production environment, and also in our first quarter guidance, where we're guiding mid-single digits on 2% production. So, I think there's proof around our business model. And our business model, as we've told you, in a low growth production environment, you can have 6% of content and then a little bit of price give-back that sort of gets to that mid-single digit around this 1% production environment. And we feel very confident with the gains we have and all the global platforms we're on, even in a 1% production environment we can drive that type of growth.", "Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, Terrence. And as my follow-up, your Transport segment margins on a year-on-year basis were lower despite significantly higher revenue. Can you help us dimension the investments you're making in Transport? Is it all in Sensors? And the magnitude and pace of investments in 2017 versus 2016 that we should expect. Thanks.", "Heath A. Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Sure, Wamsi. We're definitely investing in Sensors, as we've been saying all year, with the significant design wins we're getting in the automotive side, which won't hit revenues till 2018. So, we're investing ahead of revenue for sure. We're also continuing to invest in the harsh connectivity side and in this integrated solutions area because it's a very promising space.", "When you dissect it a little bit more, the pure auto connector margins and industrial transportation margins have held up really well in the year. So, most of this is because of investment in Sensors. If we hadn't have done that, you'd have seen our margins about flat year-over-year.", "Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thanks, Heath.", "Heath A. Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "All right.", "Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thank you, Wamsi. Can we have the next question, please?", "Operator", "The next question is the line of Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thank you very much. In the past, your company has been pretty firm on kind of an equation of \u2013 for Transportation of global SAR (33:54) growth plus content growth less ASP growth equals organic growth. Have those numbers remained the same? And is there a chance where that content growth could actually accelerate as we're starting to see more and more the car of the future catch on or is it just that is just such a small part of the overall bucket?", "And then my second follow-up question is, on the Subsea business that you're winning, which is nice to see that, is there anything different with this round of the terms and covenants such as better visibility or worse or similar profitability or worse or better? And also, I assume that simply because it's not being funded by governments or the telecom operators that the funding is probably more in place versus past cycles, so maybe a little bit more visibility. If you can touch on that, that would be great. Thank you.", "Thomas J. Lynch - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Yeah. We might have to have you repeat the second question. My memory, I'm not sure I'll hold it all. But regarding content, Jim, that's only if you look back to four or five years ago, we would've said if we were guiding 1% production growth, we would probably have been guiding 3%, maybe 4% revenue growth. Today, we're guiding 1% and we're guiding 4% to 5% revenue growth.", "So, that's a combination of content and designing, continued designing for us. And there's no question that as the emission standards increase and you see more of a push for hybrid and electric vehicles, that's a tailwind for content. And it's been relatively slower than people have expected, but in China, for example, there's a huge push by the government there to transition to electric vehicles.", "So, that's a real positive trend for us and we're very, very well positioned in the electric vehicle and the hybrid electric vehicle with our content. So, yes, I think over time as the penetration of HEV vehicles increases, we're going to be seeing more content growth.", "We'd also, just in general, we expect content to grow about 6% over the next four to five years in the vehicle. So, it's a really good, sustainable, long-term trend that we're well positioned to take advantage of.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "And then, Jim, I'll take your SubCom question. And if I miss any of it, just hit me at the end because there was about four questions in there I think. Overall, I think when you look at the cycle we're in, one of the things that's really nice about the cycle, I don't think it changes the visibility much, but the customer base is different. It is not your traditional carriers. It is actually the cloud operators. So, it is those cloud operators that are very concerned how do they make sure they have capacity as they come out with their service offering. And that has changed the customer profile than what it was five, 10 years ago.", "So, they are much more active in owning the systems. Clearly from a financing perspective, it creates a different financing cycle because they do have the capital versus in the past it would be part of a telco operating budget or somebody had to go raise financing for the project. So, I think it helps accelerate the cycle a little bit. But it does come down to their offerings in the cloud. And I think what's great that you've seen in the programs we've won, we've had programs in the Atlantic, also the Pacific here and there are activities all around the cloud demand and the service offerings they have.", "So, when you look at the cycle, it's very good that it's a different customer base and I think we've done a good job adapting to a different customer base, and I think that's why you're seeing the strong wins, coupled with the technology we bring, have been very strong. And I think when you look at profitability, the profitability is sort of where we expect it to be at this point in the cycle. At these levels, and we'll have these levels again next year, you're going to be around company average margins, maybe a little bit less, but excellent return on capital versus the company's WACC and feel good that we have the backlog in place that secures 2017, and now we have to continue to win projects to secure 2018.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Great. Thanks so much for the details.", "Thomas J. Lynch - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thank you.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thanks, Jim.", "Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thanks, Jim. Could we have the next question, please?", "Operator", "Next question is the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Yes. Good morning. And thanks very much for taking the questions, and congratulations to all of you on your new roles. First question is on the Sensor outlook. I think the comment was expecting 7% growth in Sensors in fiscal 2017. Can you talk about is that organic or is that including the benefits of Jaquet?", "And then related to that, there was a comment about starting to see some new programs ramp in Automotive and Sensors, but then Sensors and Industrial were weak. And that actually surprised me. I thought when the Measurement Specialties deal was done, some of the earlier growth would have come in Industrial and the design-in cycles for Auto were going to take a little bit longer to ramp. So if you could just better explain where you're starting to see some of that automotive sensor content gain, that'd be helpful.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Yeah. Sure. The 7% number I quoted on the call does include Jaquet. So, when you look at it, it's split pretty much organic and inorganic, that 7%, pretty evenly between the inorganic and organic.", "You're exactly right when you think about Measurement. Measurement really did not have an automotive business, and that's one of the reasons we liked their portfolio so that we can build that out. So, the program wins that we have really when it comes to Auto, they won't be kicking in until 2018. So, we're not getting the benefit of the growth. Certainly as Tom talked, we're spending ahead to industrialize those programs and win those programs. And what's great about those programs -- they're among various technologies we'd gotten with Measurement as well as they're in multiple regions of the world. So it's not concentrated in one area. So we really like the breadth that we're winning as that will come in into 2018.", "When we look at the market conditions, because Measurement was very much focused on the industrial markets, they were getting us some of the impacts of the industrial markets that I've talked about in our Industrial segment. So, anything around general industrial, test and measurement has been slowing; that's what you see in the organic impact that we've had. We have seen some pick-up across those industrial businesses similar to what we've seen in our Industrial segment, that has given us the confidence for the 3.5%, 4% organic growth next year that's implied in our guidance. But the Auto program still will not be coming in meaningfully until 2018.", "Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "That's helpful. And then for a follow-up question on the outlook for the China auto market, you talked about expecting some normalization in China after the December quarter. I was hoping for a clarification. I mean, do you think when you talk to your customers that because of the end of the incentives at the end of this calendar year that they're pulling forward production and maybe some of this is shipping into inventory, or did you just mean you're going to be starting to have more difficult comps as you go into calendar 2017?", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "No. I think when you look at China auto production, we expect China auto production to be up 3% year-over-year. So, slower than it's been, and some of that is because of the activity this year on the small engine incentive. That small engine incentive ends in December, and we've seen actually some acceleration in orders before that as they build. I think when you sit there, we will have production in China step down quarter one to quarter two. But then, we do expect to come back into growth to more normal levels later in the year.", "So, I think when you think about our Automotive business this year and ahead, you're going to see production in the first half to be a little bit more in the first quarter and then the second quarter due mainly to that China phenomenon. And we aren't assuming any new incentives right now in our guidance. We're sort of assuming that it's they end in December.", "Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thank you.", "Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Okay. Thanks, Mark. Could we have the next question, please?", "Operator", "Next question is the line of Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.", "Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC", "Hi. Morning, everyone.", "Thomas J. Lynch - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Good morning.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Good morning, Shawn.", "Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC", "Wanted to bridge just the flat organic in Industrial at the beginning of the year with a stronger growth rate exiting the year. Is it solely just product ramps in Aerospace & Defense that you highlighted and some other factors? Are you expecting underlying demand to accelerate as you migrate through fiscal 2017 within Industrial?", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Shawn, when we look at it, I think what you have is \u2013 you mentioned one of the key drivers. Our Aerospace & Defense business is almost a third of the segment, and we do expect that to be mid-single-digit growth, similar to what we experienced this past quarter and we're guiding into the first quarter. We see the programs there and we also see some Defense programs kicking in that are share gain as well. So, that is a big driver.", "The second big driver is as medical becomes organic growth later half of the year, like I talked about in Creganna, that's \u2013 the minimally invasive market is a 7% growth market. We're growing about 10% pro forma in that. So, we feel good about those two being the big drivers in the Industrial market next year. When you get into oil and gas and general industrial, we're sort of saying it stays pretty flattish.", "So, I think some of the growth that you're going to see in some of these areas that have been a little bit more of a headwind, we're saying is flat to low single growth to get up to that low single digit organic growth. But they're the major drivers that we're looking at right now as we go into next year.", "Heath A. Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Yeah. Another thing I would add is that first half of last year, remember, had the inventory correction in it. So, you do get a little bit of a benefit of the compare.", "Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. And if I may follow up on just the medical comment with one other, what is the run rate of the medical business right now? And my follow-up question would be that, are we expecting to get to a normalized share repurchase range of, let's say, what was it, $150 million to $250 million a quarter for fiscal 2017?", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "The medical business from a run rate right now, we sit there. Next year, it will be about $500 million, both on our legacy business, as well as what we've done with both Creganna and AdvancedCath. So, they'll be north of $500 million next year, Shawn, is where we'll be running. And then I'll let Heath answer the share repurchase.", "Heath A. Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Shawn, I think we just entered the year. I think a more normalized rate to assume out of the gate is probably closer to $100 million per quarter. We'll evaluate it as the year progresses and see where M&A layers into that as well. But I think an assumption of probably a full-year share repurchase of somewhere between $400 million to $500 million in total is probably a good starting point for the year. And we'll see where M&A comes in and update you as the year progresses.", "Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Thanks, Heath. Congrats, everybody, on the new roles.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thanks, Shawn.", "Heath A. Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thank you.", "Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thank you, Shawn. Can we have the next question, please?", "Operator", "Next question is from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yes. First, just a question on the near-term environment. If I look on a 13-week basis, the bookings up sequentially in what is kind of a seasonally slow bookings period. So, any other context what you're seeing in terms of the supply chain and indications from customers that it's performing a little bit better?", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Craig, it's great question. I think what we've seen across the supply chain is actually stability. I would say lead times are staying pretty tight. People aren't taking a lot on, but there's a lot of stability and I think you saw it in how we talked about the regions. And even markets like oil and gas, it does feel like it's around this, for us, revenue of $30 million a quarter. So, overall, from a supply chain perspective, I think lead time coming into us as well as, as we're selling out, feels stable and it does feel constructive as we're going into 2017.", "Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. And then just as a follow-up on the comment of 40% greater earnings power on incremental revenue, and certainly you've had margin expansion, you've had share buyback contribute, as you move forward, what would you say would be the big levers to drive stronger earnings growth relative to revenue?", "Thomas J. Lynch - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Well, I think the big one is growth, right? We're continuing to fine tune the cost structure as always. But going forward, I'd say the big one will be driving harsh environment application growth in the 5% to 7% range. And that has a lot of leverage with it which we think will drive 40 to 50 basis points of operating margin improvement with a consistent buyback program, that's how you really add up to this 10%-plus EPS growth. So, still multiple levers to go, and a fair amount of improvement yet to continue to be realized, which is exciting.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "And I think 2017 guidance we gave this morning is right along that. So, you get to see the multiple levers. With the mid-single digit top line guidance, which is organic plus a little bit of inorganic, the margin expansion, as well as share buyback, you really get to see all the levers that are \u2013 all of them working together to get to that double digit growth we guided to for 2017.", "Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Thanks.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thanks, Craig.", "Thomas J. Lynch - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thank you.", "Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Okay. Thank you, Craig.", "Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "We have no further questions.

Welcome to the TE Connectivity First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Sujal Shah. Please go ahead.", "Sujal Shah", "Good morning. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity\u2019s first quarter 2017 results. With me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Lynch; President, Terrence Curtin; and Chief Financial Officer, Heath Mitts.", "During the course of this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today\u2019s press release. In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning. We ask you to review the sections of our press release and the accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items. The press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com.", "Finally, for participants on the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call, I would like to remind everyone to limit themselves to one follow-up question to make sure we are able to cover all questions during the allotted time.", "Now, let me turn the call over to Tom for opening comments.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks, Sujal and thanks everybody for joining us today. We had an excellent start to fiscal 2017, delivering revenue growth, margin expansion and earnings growth well above the midpoint of our guidance. Improving markets coupled with strong execution across our segments drove this performance. I will provide some highlights and context for our Q1 results and then I will turn it over to Terrence to provide more detail on our performance and outlook.", "TE\u2019s strategy has been driven around three key pillars for sometime now. First, our focus on harsh environment applications, these applications demand engineering and manufacturing excellence, which provides competitive differentiation. TE stands out as a company with a broad range of harsh application knowledge and products that can provide solutions to customers anywhere in the world. Second, driving our TEOA operating system throughout the company to improve customer service and productivity and reduce our fixed cost footprint. You can see and feel the benefits across the company and through feedback we received from our customers. Third, consistently execute on our balanced capital allocation strategy, which has enabled us to make strategic acquisitions that have expanded our harsh environment portfolio, while consistently increasing dividends and buying back significant amounts of stock.", "Since becoming a public company in 2007, we returned approximately $12 billion to shareholders and bought back 184 million shares. We expect to maintain our balanced capital strategy returning two-thirds of free cash flow to shareholders and using one-third for acquisitions. The cumulative effect of this strategy enabled us to grow share on the markets we serve and transform our portfolio with more growth opportunities, while consistently returning capital to our owners through a strong cash return business model. The net effect is that a $1 of revenue today drives 50% more adjusted EPS than 5 years ago.", "This quarter\u2019s results reflect the benefits of this strategy. Organic sales growth was 7%, driven primarily by strong demand throughout our businesses in Asia; adjusted operating margins exceeded 17%; and adjusted EPS was $1.15, well above the midpoint of our guidance. We delivered another strong quarter of orders growth, with growth across all three segments. We continue to perform very well on harsh applications and are getting growth and profit to contributions across the portfolio.", "In the Communication segment, we saw year-over-year organic growth in data and devices earlier than our expectations. This is driven by ramps of high-speed solutions at cloud infrastructure customers. I am pleased that the multiyear transformation of D&D has resulted in a refocused portfolio that will drive growth and higher profitability for the segment. We are also performing well in our acquired businesses, with a growing design win pipeline that gives us confidence for future growth.", "The first quarter demonstrates the strength of our business model. For the full year, we are expecting to expand adjusted operating margins by 50 to 70 basis points on 4% organic growth, with margin expansion being driven by all of our three segments. Versus our prior view 90 days ago, we are raising our full year organic revenue outlook by 100 basis points and our adjusted EPS guidance to $4.40 at the midpoint. Currency exchange rates are expected to impact full year adjusted EPS by $0.16 versus our prior view, and this is factored into our guidance. I am pleased that we are growing adjusted EPS 11% year-over-year even with the negative impact of the stronger dollar. Terrence and Heath will go through the moving pieces in more detail as we go through the call.", "Terrence, I will turn it over to you.", "Terrence Curtin", "Thanks, Tom and good morning everyone. Before we get into the segment results and updates that I typically go through, I want to cover our orders for the quarter, which help provide the foundation for the trends that we are seeing as well as of our expectations going forward.", "If you could please turn to Slide 4, which shows our order trends, excluding our SubCom business. Demonstrating our continued momentum that started late last year, orders were up 11% year-over-year, with the book-to-bill of 1.06. And on an organic basis, orders grew 10%. We saw organic orders growth across all three of our segments in quarter one, excluding SubCom. We also saw orders growth in all regions with particular strength in Asia, which grew 26% year-over-year, with strength in China. In Europe and the Americas, orders grew approximately 3% and 1%, respectively.", "In Transportation, orders increased 12% year-over-year and were up 4% sequentially as China OEMs increased production ahead of the expected expiration of government incentives at the end of the calendar year. Industrial orders grew 15% year-over-year due to the Creganna and Intercontec acquisitions and organic orders grew 4%, with growth across each of our three industrial businesses. In Communications, excluding SubCom and the sale of our Circuit Protection business last year, we saw year-over-year organic orders growth of 14%, including 7% growth in data and devices as we begin ramping high-speed connectivity that is benefiting from cloud applications as Tom mentioned.", "Please turn to Slide 5 so we can discuss our results by segment and let me start with Transportation. The first quarter was an excellent quarter for our segment, with sales growing double-digits year-on-year and adjusted operating margins expanding 340 basis points on increased volume and productivity improvements. Segment sales exceeded the expectations due to strength in China and Korea. Our auto sales were up 13% organically in the quarter, well ahead of auto production growth of 5% due to increased content from the secular trends we talked to you about around safe, green and connected, coupled with our very strong global leadership position. Growth was led by demand from China as the expected expiration of government incentives spurred demand in the quarter. Note that these incentives are now being faced out over the course of the year, so as we look forward, we expect that vehicle production growth in China will continue to be front-end loaded in the first half of 2017.", "For the full year, we expect 4% growth in vehicle production in China and 2% growth in auto production globally. While this assumption of 2% auto production growth globally is an increase from our prior view of 1%, this sell-side comes from the strength in the first half in China, with our outlook for the second half production being the same as our view 90 days ago. For the full year, we expect to continue to outpace the growth of production due to the continued benefit of content growth as well as share gains.", "Turning to Commercial Transportation, our team delivered another very strong quarter against still a tough backdrop. This was outperformance versus the market, with organic revenue up 16%, driven by a very strong heavy truck market in China, content growth due to the adoption of new emission standards and regulations as well as share gains. In our sensors business, the acquisition last year of Jaquet drove 3% growth overall. The business declined slightly on an organic basis, with growth in automotive applications and industrial applications being offset by softness in the North American heavy truck applications. We are expecting organic growth for the year in sensors and continue to expect a further growth inflection as we go into 2018 as further auto applications ramp the volume. For the segment, adjusted operating margins of 22% were up 340 basis points year-over-year, with strong flow-through on a double-digit organic sales and increase of productivity improvements. When you think about the segment margin, our margin expectations remained the same for the segment and you should continue to think of steady state transportation operating margins as 20% plus or minus to 1.", "Please turn to Slide 6, so I can discuss our Industrial Solutions segment, which performed in line on both the top line and on the margin side in quarter one. Industrial solutions sales grew 12% on a reported basis, driven by the Creganna and Intercontec acquisitions and generated 30 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, despite the 80 basis points of headwind from the declines in oil and gas. If we had owned Creganna and Intercontec in the year ago period, our growth for this business would grow up at 16% year-over-year, demonstrating strong performance of these acquired businesses. Industrial Equipment, we grew 1% organically, driven by strengthening market around the factory automation area as well as growth in medical. Aerospace and defense remained strong with 4% organic growth, driven by increased content on new airframe builds as well as momentum in defense programs.", "Oil and gas declined 24% as expected due to the weakened market conditions and we feel that our oil and gas business has now bottomed and expect this business to remain stable at the current level as we benefit from new programs ramping later in the year. Our energy business declined 3% organically, with growth in North America and Asia more than offset by the softness in Europe. Adjusted operating margins were in line with expectations and expanded 30 basis points year-over-year to 11.3%, which includes the oil and gas impact I mentioned earlier. Going forward, we do expect the industrial segment operating margins to expand over prior year levels in the second quarter and then further into second half throughout the segment. I would also like to note that we also included adjusted EBITDA margins on the chart show margins and margin expansion, excluding the impact from the acquisition related amortization. And you can see in the segment that the year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 120 basis points to 16.4%.", "So please turn to Slide 7, so I can talk about communications solutions. Quarter one was a solid quarter from the Communications segment, including our achievement of a key milestone in our data and devices business. D&D has returned to organic growth following 3 years of decline from product exits as we refocused the portfolio within the business. Organic growth is occurring six months sooner than we expected in the business. I would also like to highlight that we also have a very strong quarter growth in our appliances business and we saw continued operational improvements throughout the segment that I will talk more about in a little bit. Organically, sales were up 3%, with reported segment sales down 4% year-over-year, due primarily to the sale of the Circuit Protection business in March of last year. Our appliance business has very strong quarter growth, with 14% organic growth year-over-year, driven by China market growth, share gains and strength in North America. The growth in D&D is the result of new ramps at cloud customers and a completion of our multi-year journey to refocus the product portfolio in key growth applications. D&D grew 2% organically in the quarter and now we expect organic growth for the full fiscal year. In addition to the growth that we are excited about, data and devices also doubled its top earning adjusted margin from a year ago and we expect this business to be an increasing contributor to the profitability of the Communications segment going forward.", "On SubCom, the business declined slightly in the first quarter as a result of program timing. Our momentum continues through this growth cycle and we continue to expect SubCom to grow approximately 5% in fiscal 2017 based upon our very strong backlog. For the Communications segment, adjusted operating margins were 13.2% for the quarter, down 70 basis points year-over-year. And if you remember, this time last year, we had a one-time benefit on our SubCom business related to an early program completion, which raised our first quarter \u201816 margin in the segment by approximately 400 basis points. If you would normalize for this impact, Communications\u2019 adjusted operating margins expanded significantly in the first quarter of \u201817. And to really illustrate the progress that we have made in this segment over the past four quarters, adjusted operating margins have expanded from approximately 8% in the second quarter of last year to 13% in the quarter we just completed. And we are proud of that accomplishment.", "So let me turn it over to Heath and he will cover the financials.", "Heath Mitts", "Thank you, Terrence and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, where I will provide more details on Q1 earnings. Adjusted operating income was $536 million, with an adjusted operating margin of 17.5%, driven by strong organic growth of 7%, productivity improvements and favorable mix. GAAP operating income was $486 million and included $47 million of restructuring charges and $3 million of acquisition related charges. For the full year, we expect restructuring charges of approximately $150 million, driven by footprint consolidations from recent acquisitions and structural improvements. GAAP EPS was $1.13 for the quarter. Adjusted EPS was a new record for the first quarter at $1.15, it was up 37% year-on-year and significantly above our guidance range set 90 days ago.", "Additional demand from China and productivity improvements drove the performance above our guidance to midpoint of $1. The 37% growth above prior year is driven by all of the levers we have in our business model. We benefited from volume fall through, on increased sales, acquisitions support, share buyback and a lower adjusted effective tax rate of 19.2%. Versus our guidance view of Q1, the currency exchange headwind was greater than expectations at $45 million of revenue and $0.02 of EPS. As a point of reference, our guidance is simply the dollar to euro conversion of 1.10 and the dollar strength has significantly hits the euro and it gets most major currencies in the quarter. For the full year, we are expecting currency exchange rates to unfavorably impact revenue and adjusted EPS by $300 million and $0.16, respectively versus prior guidance. I continue to expect full year adjusted effective tax rate of 20% for fiscal 2017, which is higher than the ETR last year. While nothing has changed in our tax rate assumptions, I want to point out that year-over-year, we get an EPS benefit in the first half of fiscal \u201817 and have an EPS headwind in the second half of fiscal \u201817. Remember that our third quarter of 2016 and fourth quarter of 2016 tax rates were 17% and 13%, respectively. With our 20% tax rate assumption this year, we expect to see year-over-year EPS headwind in the second half of approximately $0.13 due to the difference in our tax rates. This is not a change versus our guidance from 90 days ago, but I wanted to provide some color on the timing. Page 16 of our slide deck contains a bridge that provide the details for the first half and second half.", "Please turn to Slide 9. As Tom mentioned in his opening remarks, our solid results reflect the impact of our transition to a higher margin, harsh environment portfolio, our focus on TEOA and our capital strategies. Our business is generating higher operating leverage as a result of the strategy and each dollar of sales generates 50% more adjusted EPS today than it did 5 years ago. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 34.8%, a 140 basis point improvement from prior year, driven by volume fall-through on increased volumes, productivity improvements, favorable mix and savings from portfolio actions with D&D.", "As noted earlier, adjusted operating margins were 17.5% in the quarter, up 180 basis points year-over-year. In the past, we have discussed how our business model outlines that TE can generate 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion on organic growth of 5% to 7%. However, with the transformation of the portfolio and continued successful execution of our TEOA initiatives, we believe that we could generate 50 to 70 basis points of adjusted margin expansion in 2017 on 4% organic growth, which demonstrates our strong organic model. We will also increasingly discuss adjusted EBITDA at the segment level to help explain the cash earnings of our businesses as it exclude the impact of amortization from acquisitions.", "For TE, adjusted EBITDA margins in Q1 were strong at 22.7% and up 190 basis points year-on-year. To show the progress that we have made, adjusted EBITDA margins are up over 500 basis points from 5 years ago. Cash from continuing operations was $404 million and free cash flow was $218 million in the quarter. We returned $234 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the quarter. Looking ahead, we continue to expect free cash flow to approximate net income, capital expenditures to be approximately 5% of sales. We remain committed to our disciplined long-term capital strategy of a balanced return on free cash flow to shareholders, while still having ample free cash flow for acquisitions. As a point of reference, we have increased the dividend per share by approximately 300% since becoming a public company. Our balance sheet is strong, with reasonable debt levels and then the ability to continue to support the return on capital and acquisitions going forward. We have added a balance sheet and cash flow summary in the appendix for additional details.", "Now, with that, I will turn it back to Terrence.", "Terrence Curtin", "Thanks, Heath. So now, I will get into our guidance for the second quarter as well as for the full year of 2017. So, if you could please turn to Slide 10 and I will follow up with the quarter two outlook. We expect second quarter revenue of $3.025 billion to $3.125 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.09, representing sales growth of 4% on both the recorded and on an organic basis and 19% EPS growth at the midpoint. This guidance does include the impact of a stronger dollar, which we expect to be a $60 million headwind to sales and a $0.03 headwind to EPS on a year-over-year basis.", "Following two consecutive quarters of record adjusted earnings per share and strong orders in the first quarter, we expect our second quarter adjusted EPS to also be a quarterly record and our guidance represents a strong first half of fiscal 2017. By segment, we expect Transportation Solutions to grow mid single-digits organically and low single-digits on a recorded basis due to the impact of the dollar. This is above expected auto production growth levels of 2% in the second quarter, where exact growth will be driven by Asia and in Europe. Commercial transportation growth is expected to be driven by China. In industrial solutions, we expect to grow mid-teens overall through the Creganna and Intercontec acquisitions and we will be up low single-digits organically. And in communications, we expect mid single-digit organic growth, with growth in all three of our businesses.", "Now if you can turn to Slide 11 and let me cover full year guidance. Relative to our prior view 90 days ago, we are raising our organic growth expectations for 2017 by 100 basis points and raising the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance, with better operational performance more than offsetting the headwinds from the strengthening dollar that Heath highlighted. While we are raising our guidance for the full year, we are maintaining our previous view of the second half by keeping our second half organic growth expectations consistent with our view, 90 days ago. I believe this is prudent given the uncertainty in the macro environment. And when you look at the implied trends for first half to second half, please keep in mind the impact of the stronger dollar and the tax dynamics that Heath mentioned earlier and we have some slide details in the back of slide material for your reference.", "For the full year, we expect revenue in the range of $12.2 billion to $12.6 billion and adjusted EPS of $4.30 a share to $4.50 a share. This represents 3% reported growth, 4% organic growth on the top line and 11% adjusted EPS growth at the midpoint versus 52 weeks of fiscal 2016. Relative to our prior view of revenue guidance, reported revenue growth is down 200 basis points due to the $300 million impact from the currency exchange rates. Our organic growth is up 100 basis points, reflecting improvement in the transportation and communication segments. We are raising the midpoint of adjusted EPS from $4.34 to $4.40, which in essence, includes a $0.22 increase due to operational improvements and better performance from our acquisitions. Then this is offset by $0.16 of headwind from the stronger dollar. So really, highlighting the strong business model Heath and Tom talked about.", "I do feel very good about our ability to drive 4% organic growth, expand the operating margins by 50 to 70 basis points and generate double-digit adjusted EPS growth in this uncertain macro environment. This is an improvement and demonstrates as the portfolio is delivering, while we continue to benefit from the secular trend of content growth across our businesses. While much of our operating margin expansion in the past few years have been driven by our transportation segment, I am pleased that in 2017 our operating margin expansion will be driven by all three segments, with more contribution from communications and industrial. So before the full year guidance and thinking through the segments, we expect transportation solutions to be up mid single-digits organically, on 2% auto production growth reflecting content growth trends and share gains. We also expect commercial transportation to outperform its end market again this year, benefiting from content expansion in the heavy truck market. And we expect sensors to grow mid single-digits in total year-over-year.", "Industrial Solutions\u2019 organic growth guidance is not changing from 90 days ago and we continue to expect growth to be up low single-digits organically, with continued gains in commercial aerospace and defense as well as medical. Communications is expected to be up mid single-digits organically, an increase versus our prior year view due to the strength in appliances and data and devices. And as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve hit a milestone of improved performance in the D&D business. Progress and growth and profitability is ahead of our prior expectations. We now expect organic growth for D&D in fiscal 2017 in the low single-digits and momentum in SubCom remains strong. And we continue to expect growth in the mid single-digits for the year in SubCom.", "Before I turn it back to Tom for closing comments, I do want to highlight that this is Tom\u2019s last earnings call as our CEO, after doing about 40 of these earnings calls with you all. And I do want to say on behalf of the leadership team as well as our 70,000 employees I want to publicly thank Tom for his leadership over the past 10 years.", "So with that, Tom I will turn it back over to you for closing comments.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks, Terrence. I appreciate that. Well, to sum things up, this was a great quarter and positions TE for another very good year of performance. Our portfolio is focused on the right markets and we are the leader in the vast majority of these markets. We are consistently improving our customer satisfaction growing margins and earnings per share and returning capital to shareholders. Most importantly though we have a strong passionate organization across the globe that really is dedicated to providing our customers with an extraordinary experience. It\u2019s making a difference.", "Our customers have given us the feedback. They have given us more opportunity and it\u2019s definitely showing up in the financials. As this will be as Terrence mentioned, my last earnings call, hard to believe, where does the time go, I also want to take a moment to thank all of our investors and the analysts who have covered us. I really have enjoyed our relationship over the past 10 plus years. And it\u2019s been very rich. And most importantly, I want to thank the entire TE team for the greatest experience of my career. It\u2019s hard to imagine that you could be this fortunate to work with a team like this for this long. In March, Terrence will succeed me as CEO in a very well-planned transition. Terrence is uniquely positioned to take TE to the next level of performance and I really \u2013 I just couldn\u2019t feel any better about this succession. I am really \u2013 we worked together for \u2013 since the beginning. He has been a driving force in building this company and he has a clear vision, for taken in a really strong team to work with, to go there. So I will miss it, for sure, but it is the right time to turn it over to this team. So with that, let\u2019s open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Okay. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Wamsi Mohan", "Yes. Thank you good morning. Tom, good luck. It\u2019s been a pleasure and hey, you are handling all the ratings here on a high note with all-time margin highs. So for my question, you had really strong auto revenue performance relative to production growth in the quarter reflecting some really strong content growth, I was wondering if you could share some color around this content growth where that was strongest regionally and some other drivers that supported it, any color around that. And it looks like when I look at your full year guide for the Auto segment revenues relative to production, it looks like that relative growth delta sort of slows down for the course of the year, so is that just conservatism or what are the dynamics that you are seeing there and I have a follow-up?", "Terrence Curtin", "Yes. Wamsi, let me take that. When you look at it, the first quarter what was a very strong quarter and it was driven at Asia. We saw I think, continued trends around sort of North America being flat, but we also did have growth in Europe. When you think through the content, it\u2019s broad based. It is not one application and I think really when it comes to the perfect content and the share gains, it represents our strong global position that we have throughout automotive. I think when you look at the year, like I said in the guidance, we did expect automotive in the second half of the year production to slowdown versus the first half. We kept that the same. We still feel when you get to the second half, while production globally, we assume to be relatively flat. We are going to still drive mid single-digit organic growth, improve that organic content and growth story. So it\u2019s just one of the elements of how production is with the strong Asia part in the first half, a lot of it is driven by China. But the content along all the trends we have, whether it\u2019s electronification of the car, how the car gets more connected or around the green side of the car, how emissions and electronics get put them on. So it isn\u2019t one specific area, it\u2019s really the combination of all the trends we talked to you about.", "Wamsi Mohan", "Okay, great. Thanks for that color Terrance. And as my follow-up, any early thoughts here on the potential impact from the border adjusted tax or more broadly maybe you can just talk about your manufacturing footprint today and how that might possibly change under different scenarios that might play out here with the new administration? Thanks.", "Terrence Curtin", "Hey Wamsi, it\u2019s Terrence again. So as you know, we produce where our customers consume. So when you look at our footprint and a lot of the work that we have done to get our capacity to the right part that Tom and Heath talked about in their prepared comments, we feel very good about where our footprint is aligned with where our customers are. So we are fairly balanced when it comes to that element. How the border tax comes out, I think we all have to sit there and wait to see how that does. When we sit there today, we like where we are positioned manufacturing wise and we will keep you all updated. Clearly, on things and tax related to repatriation, being a Swiss company, that doesn\u2019t really impact us positively or negatively. So from that viewpoint when we look at the guidance we gave you, it\u2019s pretty much a steady-state guidance as we think about it.", "Wamsi Mohan", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot Terrance and good luck guys, great results.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks Wamsi.", "Terrence Curtin", "Thanks Wamsi.", "Sujal Shah", "Could we have the next question please?", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Craig Hettenbach", "Yes. Thanks. First question, I just wanted to touch on kind of the content near-term environment, as you said you may be taking a hopefully conservative approach to the back half of the year and not flowing this through, but just I feel like we have been here in the last few years a couple of times where there has been some glimmers of expansion and it kind of fades, so anything different you are seeing from customers or any types of inflections, design-ins, things like that, that you kind of compare and contrast where we are today versus the last few years?", "Terrence Curtin", "What I would say Craig, I think there is a couple of things. One of the things, if you look to the quarter, it\u2019s very broad based across all our businesses. And that\u2019s something you haven\u2019t seen in a while. I would also say both through our direct customer relationships, I would also say our channel partners you will see some confidence in some of their activity. The other thing that I would say is \u2013 it is across \u2013 all orders grew in all three regions. So there is to your view, some glimmer of I think it shows the background around our markets, but I would also say there is still uncertainty in the macro when you deal with things like the currency rates that while we have capped our back half the way it is from where we guided. So when we sit there, I do think you are going to continue to see improvement. Clearly, you are going to see improvement in our Industrial and Communications segment as we go through the year. I think the order trends for some of the comments we made show very strong trends that we are excited about. And then also the element around D&D growth. That\u2019s not a headwind thereafter. We did a lot of pruning to get that business focused on applications where we thought we could get paid for the great engineering and serve our customers for that we do. So I do think there are some positive glimmers of momentum not only in the business, but in the markets we serve. So, I do think it feels a little different from the backdrop than it was a year ago or even during certain times last year.", "Craig Hettenbach", "Got it. Thanks for the color there. And then just as a follow-up, I know the company is highlighted from an integrated product perspective the opportunity in transmission applications, just wanted to get an update kind of where you are there. And then really even beyond that, are there other types of applications within autos where you see the potential for some integrated products?", "Terrence Curtin", "Absolutely, certainly when you think about integrated products and where we bring [ph] sort of giving much more than just an interconnect product, but other technologies like sensors and sometimes even some of our cable technology on the material side, it does go broader than transmission. I know we use the transmission example as one to bring it to life, but it is then brake applications. It is then track applications. It\u2019s throughout the auto, is where we get those. So it is much broader than that and probably what we should do is break some of those and there is the life as we talk to investors. I know we have been talking a lot about the transmission example. But Craig, I think the important point is, when you see the content growth that we are driving above production like we did in the first quarter and what we guided for the year in auto, it shows integrated solutions that help drive that content up. That\u2019s why we have confidence that over time, what we do around $60 today, over the next 5 years, we can take up to that $80 range, not only from the trends that we benefit from, but also bringing those integrated solutions to our customers and we become more important to them and serve to many where they are in the world.", "Craig Hettenbach", "Okay. Thanks.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks Craig.", "Sujal Shah", "Thanks Craig. Could we have next question, please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Amit Daryanani", "Thanks. I have two as well, but first, congratulations and best of luck Tom, on your next chapter.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks Amit.", "Amit Daryanani", "I guess just start to with on transportation side Terrence, could you just quantify \u2013 did you say 20% off margins plus or minus 100 or 22% for the rest of the year. And within that, just what sort of headwind do you think you have in transportation right now, from Sensor segment margins being below the transportation averages and if you could quantify clarify that part for us?", "Terrence Curtin", "Sure my comment was 20% Amit, plus or minus 1%. So I appreciate you being aggressive. Well and on the sensors, sensors actually \u2013 we all know that, that\u2019s running single-digit as we continue to invest ahead of the range that we have ahead of us that will begin in 2018. So we do think that, that will be a lever over time as those programs ramp, but we saw a significant investment in those programs. So as we talk to you, we do think that app will get up to mid-teens EBITDA over time, but we are going to make investments and plan to ramp this programs and we are from a margin perspective, investing ahead. So I do think that\u2019s something that we will have a little bit more of detail on it, but it will help the transportation margins over time.", "Amit Daryanani", "Got it. Eventually, it will be 22% plus or minus 100, just not right now. I guess maybe a follow-up, if I look at your full year guide, right, either on the op margin expansion that you guys are talking about, or really the EPS growth, it all seems very first half heavy to me, the back half margin, I think implied flat EPS probably down I think in the back half and again, the tax rate adjustment is a big factor there. But I guess just talking about given the strength you are seeing in end demand, auto book is really good, your book-to-bill is really strong, it doesn\u2019t seem like you are extending this positivity into the back half of the year. What holds you back and what refrains you from doing that right now?", "Heath Mitts", "This is Heath. I think we are taking a prudent view of the back half of the year, just with the \u2013 certainly we are benefiting the first half from some very strong Asia auto, but the broadening strength across the portfolio is encouraging. And we will continue to update you as we move along throughout the year. I would say we just want to make sure that people well understand the second half impact of the higher sub tax rate relative to some lower tax rates we had in prior year in the second half. And then the FX \u2013 the anticipated FX headwind is more significant in the back half. So from those will impact, how we think about is year-over-year second half EPS, from a margin perspective, we admittedly, the 17.5% is everything pointing in the right direction for mix and everything else in the quarter and we are taking a prudent view as we look through the back half of the year. But there is nothing that I say artificially inflates that 17.5% and nor do we expect something that comes in, that is significantly unfavorable other than just the operating activities in the back half of the year.", "Amit Daryanani", "Perfect. Thanks a lot and congratulations on a nice win guys.", "Tom Lynch", "Thank you.", "Heath Mitts", "Thanks.", "Sujal Shah", "Could we have the next question, please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citi. Please go ahead.", "Jim Suva", "Thank you very much. Many of the questions and comments before this were focused on the auto sector and transportation, which is rightfully so. So, I think my follow-up questions I will ask on the other segments. And that is two questions I will ask them at the same time. First on industrial, we do note that oil prices are up year-over-year. So, one would hope that maybe that would help out with, say, the industrial segment some, is that starting to kick in or maybe I am off on what the key performance leading indicators are that you are looking at or how should we think about that? And especially with the new Presidential Trump administration signing in things like Keystone products, EPA changes and things like that, how should we think about it? And then my follow-up question is on the SubCom business, you mentioned last year you\u2019ve got a benefit of course, but your guidance on SubCom looks a bit different than say some of the other customers and competitors who are seeing extremely strong SubCom pipelines. And I was just kind of curious about what you are seeing on the SubCom side? Thank you.", "Terrence Curtin", "Sure, Jim. Let me take both of those. So let\u2019s start with oil and gas. Number one is when you look at our oil and gas business, we basically are seeing stabilization. And that stabilization, we are happy to see certainly we hope upside comps as oil moves, but right now, I would say as we see it from the programs we are exposed to is much more around stabilization than I would say any ramp up. The other element that I would say when you think about our oil and gas business, it is very much around oceanic oil. So pipelines, land-based, we are not strong in that. So on that, it is important to understand this is really around offshore oil and gas and the indicators around that are really offshore rigs. So where we see things right now is it\u2019s still stable in our guidance, and hopefully, we get some benefit from some of the things that President Trump is talking about that those kick in and help them back to get us little bit more upside in industrial. But that\u2019s not assumed right now. On SubCom, we feel very good about where we are at. Similar really, not much has changed since the last quarter. Our guidance for the year is to be up 5% that will put us well over $900 million in revenue. Our backlog, we are booked for the \u2013 so really when we look at the programs that we win throughout this year, it\u2019s really around 2018. So, 2017 is very locked and loaded. Our team is working very hard to execute to the backlog with where we are from an execution perspective and really program \u2013 it\u2019s a pipeline of programs that we are quoting and trying to win, it\u2019s still very active. So we still think we are in a growth phase, but I would just say, right now, the 5% that we talked about last quarter being up year-over-year, even though we were down a little bit due to timing in the first quarter, we feel right in front of us and it\u2019s really around execution for us this year. So clearly, benefit from cloud applications, not only in SubCom, you\u2019ve heard it in D&D, where we have also had that benefit. The hyperscale customers and we are getting benefits in both the segments from them.", "Jim Suva", "Okay, thank you for your details. Much appreciate it.", "Terrence Curtin", "Thank you, Jim.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks, Jim.", "Sujal Shah", "Could we have the next question, please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Shawn Harrison from Longbow Research. Please go ahead.", "Shawn Harrison", "Hi, good morning. I wanted to just, I guess, get the earlier recovery within data and devices and maybe just kind of what brought about the earlier recovery? Did the winds ran faster? And maybe just what could be the growth rate within that business going forward since we really don\u2019t have a comp for the past couple of years given that the pruning in the business sales and everything else?", "Tom Lynch", "Sure, Shawn. If you look at it, it really comes down to penetration on high-speed applications and with the growth on how they are ramping with some of the cloud infrastructure providers and hyperscale customers. So really when you look at it, those customers are probably about 20% of our data and device businesses today. We have been focused on it. And the adoption that we are seeing and the ramps that they have done have been a little bit quicker than we expected. So, I think the momentum that you have been waiting for and we have been waiting for, we are very pleased at 6 months ahead and it actually shows the design wins and the execution momentum we are getting in the business, again, to drive growth. 90 days ago, we told you we were probably going to be flat in data and devices for the year organically and with growth in the second half. We closed 200 basis points here. We do think it will be in the low single-digit for the year, but I think you are going to get growth throughout the year. And I think the real thing about you should assume right now is that we believe this business can be a low single-digit organic grower right now and it\u2019s really going to be as we continue to build our product focus there, how much higher can we take it. And I would still say, what\u2019s great is we are at that inflection point that we have been waiting for and it\u2019s a real testament for the team getting that momentum sooner and certainly been focused on the customer\u2019s organization. So clearly pleased with where we are with it, because it\u2019s also focused on the right customers and getting wins with the right customers, everywhere in the world.", "Shawn Harrison", "That\u2019s helpful, Terrence. And then a follow for Heath, if I may. I think the restructuring charge for the year may have went up a bit, maybe I am wrong, but I was hoping you could actually speak now that you have been there for more than a few \u2013 a month or so, for I think the last \u2013 with the last call. Just the kind of maybe some opportunities in terms of just maybe leaning out the organization and how you are going to approach M&A going forward, maybe some \u2013 are there opportunities like Intercontec that are out there in the TE kind of funnel that we could see close during the year? So if you could just touch on those topics? That would be great.", "Terrence Curtin", "Sure. Well, a couple of different angles there. We did inch up the restructuring comments from 90 days ago and largely there is not one item on there that drives it. There is a list of several things, particularly around some footprint consolidation that continues to go on, or deals for acquisitions that have been completed over the last few years. And marginally, that\u2019s facility consolidation. And then there are some structural things that we look at and we will continue to be ongoing, I\u2019d say for this year and probably into the early part of next year, just in terms of how organized and the layers within the company. So more to come on that, but I think we are sharpening our pencils certainly. Not all $150 million of that restructuring would be cash charges. There is some things in there that are non-cash that we will talk about later in the year. So, more to come on that, but in the M&A side, certainly we are active. Intercontec has been a great performance out of the gate. We are also very pleased with the performance on the medical side, Creganna \u2013 well, both of those are well ahead of the deal model expectations and are executed very well. And Creganna, we will anniversary here little bit late this quarter, in terms of the fresh full year on our portfolio. The Medical space has continued to have legs to it. And so looking at things along that, maybe not the same size necessarily of ground type transaction, those things are a little bit closer to the Intercontec size or something, plus or minus in that range that have good margins and where we can get to a return on invested capital may be a little quicker than historically we have, so lots of opportunity out there, but we will be choosy and spend the shareholders\u2019 dollar wisely.", "Shawn Harrison", "Right, that\u2019s grateful and congrats on the quarter and Tom thanks for all the help. I appreciate it.", "Tom Lynch", "You are very welcome. Thank you.", "Sujal Shah", "Could we have the next question?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of William Stein from SunTrust. Please go ahead.", "William Stein", "Great. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats to everyone on the roles, especially Tom, you have really transformed this thing from the old Tyco.", "Tom Lynch", "Thank you.", "William Stein", "But I did have a question on the sensor demand, it sounds like you are lowering that outlook modestly, we have thought that this would be sort of an accelerating market for content share and integration, can you offer us a little bit more detail on how that market is progressing for you now, how you expect it to perform over the next several quarters?", "Terrence Curtin", "Yes. A couple of things, well, thanks for the question. Our expectations around sensors has not changed for the New Year. Overall, we expect growth to be mid single-digit. The only change we would have to be due to FX, so our expectation has not changed versus where we were. I think when you look at it, certainly, we did get impacted in our sensors business by the same thing that impacted our industrial business since we bought Measurement. And Measurement was very much focused on industrial applications. So as there was the industrial recession going on that impacted our Industrial segment, it did also impact the Measurement asset, then the growth was a little bit slower. What we really get excited about was when we bought Measurement, we basically signed up to scale that and use our go-to-market and take that great Measurement technology into different markets like automotive and to places like industrial transportation. And really, those program wins and that momentum there is very strong, that program pipeline is strong. But as you know, those programs don\u2019t \u2013 one of the day and ship them in three months, they are programs that we have been building out past couple of years. And really you are going to see the growth of that, really in 2018 as when we are going to start having some of our launches. That\u2019s why we are investing ahead in sensors and part of those programs. And in some cases, that they are integrated products. They are not just the sensor element, they are things that also have additional things on them. So we feel very good that we are leveraging our go-to-market to get those wins. Certainly, you are not seeing them in the numbers yet. And 2018 is when you are going to start to see those come through with revenue and going to be excited to show it to you in \u201918 and shows you normalcy in 2017, is not just where the program ramps are.", "William Stein", "It is actually really good color and my follow-up related to that is pretty brief. Those gains that you are ramping now in terms of the design wins, where we will see revenue in \u201818, would you expect those to wind up coming at the expense of another company already in that space or are these brand-new applications and I assume it\u2019s mostly in automotive?", "Terrence Curtin", "Yes. They are a big chunk order in automotive and they are among many technologies. So there you amended either temperature, the pressure, they are among many different technologies and in the sensor space the fragmentation around the sensor space, really make to that, you compete against different people not one competitor. So what\u2019s really great about the programs we have won is they are among varying technologies, they are at different regions of the world, which really shows the strength of our go-to-market and then it also comes out some of that business case that when we bought Measurement to get these technologies, how do we leverage our go-to-market in places where we have very exceptional leadership positions like our Transportation segment, we are leveraging. So we will continue to share those as they ramp, but 2018 will be the year where you will start seeing it in the numbers versus just from our works.", "William Stein", "Thanks and congrats again on the great print.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks Will", "Sujal Shah", "Thank you. Could we have the next question?", "Operator", "Your next question comes on the line of Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Mark Delaney", "Yes. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Congratulations on good results and Tom, let me add my best wishes for you going forward.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks Mark.", "Mark Delaney", "The first question is just specifically on Asian auto, there is talk about some potential slowdown there on the call and if we strip out the FX impact, your 4.40 becomes 4.56 for full year guide and you guys were on a 4.60 run rate, so it seems even excluding FX, there is some slowdown baked into the business as we go through the year, is there anything you are actually seeing in the Asian automotive business that\u2019s starting to slowdown either in terms of orders or customer conversations or is that just you are doing your best to forecast the potential change there for the back half?", "Terrence Curtin", "When you look at it Mark, similar to last quarter, we knew there is this China incentives that was ending at the end of the first quarter. We expected a slide in China demand that the incentive is sort of phased out throughout the year. We do expect production to still stay strong into the second quarter, but there is still is an element of when you have incentives, this is pull forward demand. And so when we look at it and talking to our customers, they have told us things back to production to moderate in the second half versus a very strong level we are going to have in the first quarter and continue a little bit in the second quarter. So it\u2019s not really different that while we pull forward, just we are getting a little bit decreased production due to the incentive being phased out. So when we look at the second half, the second half is identical to where we were 90 days ago and if there is more incentives around China, I would expect we would benefit from it, but they are not there yet. And we are really aligned with our customers. So like we said, we expect auto production in our third and fourth quarter to be relatively flat, globally. But we expect organic growth in our automotive business, even in a flat environment due to our content and share gains. So when you look at that year-on-year, we do expect growth in transportation in a flat backdrop production months right now.", "Mark Delaney", "That\u2019s helpful. Follow-up question is on margin and the gross margin in particular came in very nicely at 34.8, I think it\u2019s all-time high, certainly more than I was looking for, I think it was something unusual in there, but there is guidance it seems assumes margin to moderate as we go through the year, can you just tell us specifically, how should we think about the gross margin line and what sort of factors help to get to that 34.8 and why should we expect it to come down as we move through the year on the margin level?", "Heath Mitts", "Mark, I think it\u2019s similar to the same answer that I provided earlier on the overall operating margin. I think in the quarter certainly, we benefited from the volumes being higher than I think would be certainly guided earlier. And then we also invested favorable mix in the quarter in terms of just geographically where things were delivered. So I don\u2019t think we are looking at a significant drop in gross margins, but you could be with that a point or so.", "Mark Delaney", "That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much.", "Sujal Shah", "Thank you, Mark. Could we have the next question?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fox from Cross Research. Please go ahead.", "Steve Fox", "Thanks. Good morning. First of all Tom, not to date myself too much, but if I think back to what you were handed when you took the job, I never would have thought you would have been this successful with the business, but congratulations.", "Tom Lynch", "Thank you very much.", "Steve Fox", "Every thing you did, surely one of the better managing jobs I have ever seen. So in terms of just big picture question, if I could, one of the things that I noticed at the last CES I attended in January, was that a lot of the Tier 1 OEMs are sort of moving further up the stack and I am thinking the guys that also make sensors and connectors and as they do that, it seems like they are looking to put more turnkey solutions out there, integrating some of the products that you are focused on and I was curious if you think that, that\u2019s either a competitive threat, maybe pressure to margins or how you would deal with that in your own roadmap, going forward and I know that\u2019s a longer term question, but I was just curious what you thought? Thanks.", "Terrence Curtin", "Tom, do you want to start with that and I will jump in then?", "Tom Lynch", "No, I think you should take this Terrence, go ahead.", "Terrence Curtin", "Alright. Now, when you look at it clearly, we view that as an opportunity. When you get into any integration and one of the things that\u2019s great about the business that we have always had is we benefit from electronics trends, but we also get integrated out due to electronic trends. Connectors can be integrated out by semiconductors and so forth, but because there are more electronics happening, it also creates in that content opportunity. I think when we look at it Steve, it\u2019s really around it creates more opportunity because of the abilities we have and the value we provide to our customers. So why as we said there it\u2019s why we get excited about our content in auto being able to grow from the 60 to 80 that we talked about, because what sensors brings to it, how we integrate these things in, I mean we probably aren\u2019t to a turnkey level, but you describe how I think about it, but that integration we provide to allow some way to get to a turnkey level is very important. And that drives the content growth opportunity and the stickiness we have with our customers and our engineers basically create so much more opportunities. So we knew that\u2019s a net-net opportunity. We don\u2019t view its displacement, because we are very close to the architecture of the vehicle and what we do. And that is a very important factor as people continue to evolve the architecture. The world that we play in partnering with BOEs and the Tier 1s, both of them are our customers is really what we get excited about why I am so buoyant on the content opportunity. So it\u2019s all plus.", "Steve Fox", "That\u2019s helpful Terrance. And then just a quick follow-up to that, I guess as it applies to acquisitions, would you envision acquisitions still being focused on sort of discrete sensor and connector technologies or are there other materials and integration skills that you may add through deals?", "Terrence Curtin", "I think when you look at it, I think you can always think that we have always a priority towards the components side, but even when you do take Creganna, that is doing more than just a component. So I think you will see things over time of that can add integration like skills. But I think it will be a balance of both and it will be how does it tie into our strategies in different markets. I think you have seen move into that with Creganna, but we had more the component they had much more a full assembly and integration capability that we had and that\u2019s one of the things we get excited about the close of our customers and medical wanted that. And we would bring it organically alone. So I think you will see a little bit of a different answer in different markets, but I think you expect a little bit above from us.", "Steve Fox", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Terrence Curtin", "Thanks Steve.", "Sujal Shah", "Thanks Steve. Could we have the next question?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Sheerin from Stifel. Please go ahead.", "Alvin Park", "Yes. Hi, this is Alvin Park speaking on behalf of Matt Sheerin. First of all, Tom, congratulations and wish you the best of luck.", "Tom Lynch", "Thanks very much.", "Alvin Park", "Yes. Just one in terms of commodity pricing, prices have been increasing particularly for copper, so could you have some insight into how that might affect gross margins going forward for the rest of the year and if you will be able to pass those costs along to the customers?", "Terrence Curtin", "Well, as we think about fiscal \u201817, we do not anticipate a material impact from that, but that\u2019s largely because of our hedging programs that we have in place that protect us in the near-term. We will honestly monitor that as we go forward more thinking about the impact in 2018 and how we want to handle that from both the hedging as well as how we incorporate that into our cost pricing structure. But for \u201817, at this point, there is enough balance back and forth in terms of where we are seeing the different commodities move as well as where we have our programs in place, that we don\u2019t anticipate\u2026", "Alvin Park", "I see and another quick follow-up. On D&D, you talked about cloud infrastructure and I think in the previous question you mentioned the cloud infrastructure opportunity represents roughly 20% of D&D, I think you mentioned hyper conversion and the likes, but could you give us some more color and details in terms of what penetration \u2013 what areas of penetration and what opportunities you look to see going forward?", "Terrence Curtin", "When we look at it, we very much have focused portfolio around [indiscernible] applications. So went back 5 years ago, we would have talked to you about consumer electronics, devices and it\u2019s very much as we have gone through our journey there to reposition. It\u2019s been very much around high speed applications. And the great product for us we have around that which also includes miniaturization, but high speed de-coupled together. So when we sit there, it is really around the hyper scale providers certainly the big four and the people that also help them build out the cloud. So that\u2019s the one that we have been penetrating very well. We are very pleased with that they are 20% of our D&D business today. And that\u2019s going to be the area we continue to invest in on the high-speed side.", "Alvin Park", "Thank you. Thank you very much.", "Sujal Shah", "Thanks. Could we have the next question, please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Sherri Scribner", "Hi gentlemen. Thank you. I just want to ask the question sort of at a high level, if you think about the update that you are giving us versus 90 days ago, it sounds like there is a bigger FX headwind than originally thought due to the stronger dollar, but your organic outlook for transportation and industrial is really unchanged, maybe a bit more front end loaded, but on the communications side, it sounds like you have a bit more of a positive outlook for the full year, is that driven by sort of a reacceleration in SubCom through the year or is that driven by the better outlook in data devices, though I guess one is that sort of the right way to think about it and two, what\u2019s driving that outlook in communications?", "Terrence Curtin", "I think the first part of your assumption is accurate. Obviously, the strengthening dollar in the quarter versus our prior guidance has added some headwind to the year. We will quantify that at roughly at the current rates about $300 million versus our prior guidance on revenue. In terms of our outlook by segments, your comment \u2013 we are still projecting transportation to be mid single-digits, but on the higher side of mid single-digits than what we had thought 90 days ago. Industrial, right on track in terms of what our prior guidance is and you are correct on communications. We have moved that from low single-digits up to mid single-digits in terms of organic growth from Communications segment. That\u2019s largely \u2013 that increase is largely driven by appliances and D&D though. SubCom is unchanged since our last projection. We feel good about the SubCom number. It\u2019s all down to execution that\u2019s fully booked up, but the change there with the bias towards the upside is coming from the better projections out of D&D.", "Sherri Scribner", "Okay, great. And then can you give us some high level thoughts on what you are seeing geographically in the industrial business? Thanks.", "Heath Mitts", "Sure. Sherri, one of the things I mentioned was I am very pleased globally, geographically that across the \u2013 we had growth in all regions. When you look at the Industrial segment, we talked a lot about Asia with communications and transportation during our comments. We also had nice growth in industrial in Asia, for about 6% organically in Asia in the quarter. And orders drove about 18% in Asia as well, so on an organic basis. So we saw it there. We continue to see Europe in a nice position, organically sort of low single-digits. And lastly on an order side, in North America still is relatively flattish and in the industrial space for us, organically and we do expect that through the year, some of the comm air programs and medical that we will take up, but really, we see \u2013 we saw a lot of strength in Asia.", "Sherri Scribner", "Thank you.", "Heath Mitts", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Terrence Curtin", "Thank you, Sherri.", "Sujal Shah", "Thanks Sherri.

In addition, we'll be using certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning, and we ask you to review the sections of our press release and accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items.", "Press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com. Finally, for participants on the Q&A portion of today's call, I would like to remind everyone to limit themselves to one follow-up question to make sure we're able to cover all questions during the allotted time.", "Before I turn the call over to Terrence, I'm pleased to announce that we'll be hosting an Analyst Day event in New York City on December 13 for the reception of management plan of the evening of December 12. So please hold these dates to attend.", "Now, let me turn the call over to Terrence for opening comments.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thanks, Sujal and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'm very excited to share our strong results for the third quarter and our increased growth and earnings outlook we're providing for the full year. I believe this quarter's performance continues to demonstrate the strength of our business model with all of our segments contributing. It also reflects the ongoing effective implementation of our strategy to create safer, sustainable, productive and connected solutions for our customers.", "To briefly recap the key elements of our strategy that we've been driving, number one it's about driving above market growth through our focus on harsh environment applications, where we can accelerate content growth. Secondly, it's about leveraging our TEOA continuous improvement system to expand our margin. And lastly, it's delivery and consistent execution of our balanced capital allocation strategy, which allows us to further strengthen our position in our markets via bolt-on M&A, while also returning capital back to our owners.", "When you look at our third quarter, we delivered sales of $3.4 billion. This represents 8% organic growth year-over-year with growth across all our segments, as well as regions. We delivered 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year-over-year and adjusted earnings per share of $1.24, which is up 15% over the prior year.", "This year's growth in EPS year-over-year was entirely driven by our sales and operating income performance. If you want to look at our $1.24 compared to our guidance of $1.16 approximately half was driven by the higher sales growth of 8% with the remainder driven by taxes and a little bit of currency.", "As a result of our momentum and what we're seeing in our markets in orders, we are raising the mid-point of our revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance to $12.9 billion and $4.73 in EPS. This represents 7% organic revenue growth and 20% adjusted EPS growth versus the prior year. With this, we firmly believe that TE is firing on all cylinders with all segments contributing to both revenue growth and margin expansion this year.", "As I think about this year and to put it in perspective, back when we gave guidance in November, we assumed 3% organic growth and $4.34 adjusted earnings per share compared to the $3.95 we did in 2016 on a 52-week basis. The increase since the start of the year reflects strong organic growth across all segments and operational improvements across our businesses that now results in the 7% organic growth and 20% adjusted earnings per share growth, driven almost entirely by our strong operational performance.", "The broad-based growth ahead of the markets we serve continues to reinforce our strategic progress on content growth and having the right products to the right markets. If you look at our new guidance for the year compared to last quarter, the 7% organic growth outlook is an improvement of 100 basis points, and we're raising our earnings per share guidance by $0.11.", "I'd appreciate if you could turn to slide 3 and let me review some of additional highlights from the third quarter. Not only do we have growth across all segments and regions, but each of our segments delivered growth ahead of our expectations in the quarter.", "We delivered 8% organic growth in Transportation, with growth across automotive, commercial transportation and sensors. In Industrial Solutions, organic growth of 5% was driven by strength in factory automation and medical applications. And in the Communications Solutions segment, sales increased 14% organically with growth across each of our three business units, demonstrating the progress we have made in transforming this segment to be a contributor to overall TE performance.", "Also during the quarter, we had strong free cash flow of over $400 million that we generated, and we returned $324 million back to our owners, and we also announced bolt-on acquisitions in the automotive and medical markets that will expand our portfolio and ability to provide integrated highly engineered solutions in these growing markets.", "Let me get into the order trends. I appreciate if you could turn to slide 4. We continue to see broad based strength in orders across our segments as well as balanced order growth across regions which reinforces expectations for a higher growth versus our prior view.", "Total orders which exclude SubCom were $3.3 billion during the quarter, and this is up 12% year-over-year on both a reported and an organic basis. Organically excluding SubCom, our orders grew evenly with the Americas, Asia and Europe each growing low double digits in the quarter. And if you reflect back at the start of the year when we guided in our first quarter, orders and revenue growth were heavily weighted towards Asia and were encouraged by the balance we are now seeing as Europe and United States continue to strengthen.", "In Transportation, orders increased 15% organically with growth in all regions and particular strength in Europe and Asia. Industrial orders grew 6% organically year-over-year, with growth in all regions and particular strength in Asia. And in Communications excluding SubCom, we saw year-over-year organic order growth of 12%, including 7% growth in data and devices from high-speed connectivity ramping in cloud and data center applications, while appliance orders grew 17% year-over-year.", "One thing I'd like to highlight that while on a year-over-year basis, orders increased double digits in the third quarter, the guidance that we gave for the fourth quarter reflects mid-single-digit revenue growth. In our customers broader supply chain, there are supply constraints in certain areas that led to some of our quarter's reorders (8:47) being placed for delivery outside of our fourth quarter, and we have accounted for this dynamic in our guidance for the fourth quarter.", "So let me turn to segment performance, and let me start with Transportation, if you could turn to slide 5, please. The third quarter was another very strong quarter for our Transportation segment, which continued to show our content growth momentum. Sales grew 8% organically year-over-year, and operating margins were in line with our expectations.", "Segment sales exceeded expectations due to strong auto demand across regions and our leading position in the heavy truck market, along with strong sensors growth which was 7% organically. In auto, our sales were up 6% organically with mid-single-digit growth rate in the Americas, Europe and Asia against a global auto production growth of only 1%. We continue to consistently demonstrate the ability to outperform the market due to content growth and expect that trend to continue even at these lower production levels. We also expect the benefit from new program ramps as we go forward which will also continue the outperformance due to content versus market.", "For the full year of 2017, we expect high-single-digit organic growth in auto on approximately 3% production growth, but clearly that 3% production growth was driven by the stronger production growth in the first half that we talked about in prior calls.", "Turning to commercial transportation, our business continues to outperform the market with organic revenue growth of 23% year-over-year. Growth is driven by continued strength in the global heavy-duty truck market, particularly in China, and while we do expect China growth will moderate over time, we are encouraged to see signs of continued growth in Europe and North America as these markets improve.", "In sensors, during the quarter, our business grew 7% organically year-over-year with growth driven by Transportation as well as an improving industrial backdrop, and we continue to expect mid-single-digit growth for the full year in our sensors business. Additionally, we're also encouraged by the strong design win momentum that we had in sensors that was reflected by double-digit order growth year-over-year in the quarter.", "Adjusted operating margin were as expected at approximately 19% in the quarter in the segment, but I would say, at these year-over-year revenue growth levels, we would normally expect a corresponding expansion of margins versus where we guided. However, demand in the second half of this year has exceeded our expectations, and has led to some near-term inefficiencies in our supply chain as we make sure we satisfy our customers. This is a temporary issue as our teams are fully engaged to ensure our customers are not impacted by these supply dynamics, and we expect this to be fully remedied in early fiscal 2018.", "So let's talk about the Industrial Solutions segment, so I'd appreciate if you could turn to slide 6. Growth momentum in the Industrial Solutions segment continued with 5% organic growth year-over-year in the quarter. Segment sales did exceed our expectations due to strength in industrial equipment with this business growing 10% organically.", "Now, this growth we saw in the industrial equipment side is really due to our position in the factory automation and medical markets, also coupled with the acquisitions that we completed last year, and this is really driving the strong growth ahead of the market on both a reported and on an organic basis. When you think about Intercontec and Creganna, both of these acquisitions performing exceptionally well and ahead of our expectations.", "In aerospace, defense and marine, we did see a slight organic decline in the quarter in revenue, and this was driven entirely by program timing in commercial aerospace, and that was partially offset by growth in defense. Our energy business in the quarter grew 2% organically, and that was driven by growth in Europe and Asia.", "On the margin side, our adjusted operating margins for the quarter were 12.7%, and this was flat sequentially and down year-over-year due to the near term softness in commercial aerospace, which does run above segment average margins. We do expect Industrial segment margins to resume expansion in our fourth quarter, and this will be both on a sequential and year-over-year basis, driven by a combination of both growth and cost actions. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment were steady year-over-year at 17%.", "So if you could please turn to page 7, and let me cover Communications. The Communications segment delivered another outstanding quarter with 14% organic growth and 500 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion to 16%. Performance was well ahead of the market and included contributions from all three of the businesses.", "Starting with data and devices. Data and devices had 6% organic growth as we continued to benefit from high-speed ramps in cloud infrastructure customers. In addition, because of our multiyear transformation, our D&D business more than doubled its adjusted operating margin from a year ago, driving significant improvement at the segment level as the actions that we took to focus the portfolio and optimize our operations are essentially complete.", "In appliances, we had another solid quarter with 14% organic growth year-over-year as demand remained strong particularly in Asia. And in SubCom, growth was 22% organically in the quarter reflecting the strong growth cycle of this business.", "Earlier this month, we announced the winning of a new regional program which provides high-speed bandwidth between the Caribbean and the United States, and we continue to expect high-single-digit growth for the SubCom business in 2017.", "Now, with that as a backdrop, I'll hand it over to Heath who'll get into the financials in more detail.", "Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thank you, Terrence and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide 8 where I will provide more details on Q3 financials. Adjusted operating income was $559 million, with an adjusted operating margin of 16.6%, leveraging the strong organic growth of 8%. GAAP operating income was $536 million and included $19 million of restructuring changes and $4 million of acquisition-related charges.", "For full year, we continue to expect restructuring charges of approximately $150 million driven by footprint consolidation from acquisition and structural improvements. GAAP EPS was $1.21 for the quarter, adjusted EPS was a new record for the quarter at $1.24, up 15% year-on-year driven entirely by sales growth and operating margin improvement.", "The growth above prior year is a result of strong execution of our strategy with harsh applications driving growth, TEOA driving efficiency and balanced capital deployment enabling acquisitions and share repurchases. Our EPS performance was above our prior range, driven mostly by revenue growth and the benefit from a lower tax rate due to the mix of profitability by jurisdiction.", "For the fourth quarter, I expect an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 19% making the full year tax rate approximately 18% similar to last year. However, as discussed last quarter, please keep in mind the year-over-year dynamics. We received an EPS benefit in the first half of fiscal 2017 and have an EPS headwind in the fourth quarter. Going forward, I would expect an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 19% to 20%. We'll continue to provide details on that.", "Page 15 of our slide deck contains a bridge that provides these details for the first half and second half.", "Turning to slide 9, our strong Q3 results demonstrate that we are performing well against our business model and executing upon multiple levers to drive earnings growth through organic revenue growth, consistent capital strategy for M&A, and buybacks and driving margin improvement through TEOA.", "Adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 33.9%, a 90-basis-point improvement from prior year driven by fall-through on increased volumes, productivity improvements from TEOA programs and restructuring benefits.", "Adjusted operating margins were 16.6% in the quarter, up 50 basis points year-over-year and in line with our business model. As we've discussed in the past, we continue to invest in growth to support our growing design win pipeline but are also committed to reducing SG&A as a percentage of revenue over time.", "Adjusted EBITDA helps explain the cash earnings of our businesses, and adjusted EBITDA margins in Q3 were 21.2%, up 50 basis points year-on-year. Cash from continuing operations was $524 million and free cash flow was $408 million in the quarter. The year-over-year decline in free cash flow was driven by working capital needed to support growth in sales, and as you know, cash flow is not necessarily linear, and year-to-date free cash flow is slightly over $1 billion similar to last year's performance.", "We returned $324 million to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases in the quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned $405 million in dividends and $386 million through share buyback. Maintaining a strong balance sheet is part of our strategy as it provides us with competitive advantages in our marketplace, our consistency in converting earnings to cash gives us the ability to support both return on capital and acquisitions while retaining a strong financial position. We've included the balance sheet and cash flow summary in the appendix for additional details.", "And with that, I'll turn it back over to Terrence.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thanks, Heath. And let me get into guidance, and I'll start with the fourth quarter. And if you could turn to slide 10, please, I'd appreciate it.", "For the fourth quarter, we expect fourth quarter revenue at $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.14 to $1.16. When you look at this, this represents reported sales growth of 5% and organic sales growth of 4%. And from an operational perspective, this would be adjusted EPS growth of 8% once you normalize with the unusually low tax rate we had last year that Heath just highlighted.", "Looking at it by segment. For the fourth quarter, we expect Transportation Solutions to grow mid single digits on both a reported and on an organic basis. This is above expected auto production levels of 1% with the outperformance driven by the content growth I mentioned earlier.", "We also expect growth in commercial transportation across all regions in the fourth quarter, and as noted earlier, we do expect to have some lingering effects on margins from supply chain dynamics in the fourth quarter. But expect margin performance to improve as we put these issues behind us in early 2018.", "In Industrial Solutions, we expect to grow high single digits on a reported basis and mid-single digits organically, with growth expected across all three of our business units. And we also expect, as I mentioned, operating margins to expand sequentially as well as year-over-year in the fourth quarter. And in Communications, we expect also mid-single-digit growth on both the reported and organic basis with growth in each of our three businesses.", "And while we're not providing guidance beyond this fiscal year, I would ask that as you look at your models, you keep in mind our typical seasonal trends as you think about next year. And while demand continues to be strong, we historically see seasonal declines in the mid-single-digit range from quarter four into our first quarter. I'd also ask as you think about adjusted operating margins, please keep in mind that we're currently running in the mid-16% range, and that the first quarter 2017 had an unusually high operating margin level that we covered in detail back in the first quarter call.", "Now, let's turn to slide 11, so I can cover full guidance or ramp up and then go to Q&A. We are raising the midpoint of our guidance to represent 7% organic revenue growth and 20% adjusted earnings per share growth for 2017. We expect revenue in the range of $12.85 billion to $12.95 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $4.72 to $4.74.", "I'm very proud that our 20% EPS growth is driven almost entirely by strong organic growth performance and operating income expansion that we have in 2017. We did also benefit from using our strong cash flow model both via adding on bolt-on M&A and returning capital to our owners.", "When you think about the growth in the margin and the EPS by segment, we expect Transportation Solutions to be up high-single digits organically on approximately 3% global auto production growth this year, reflecting continued content growth and share gains. Commercial transportation, we'd expect it to outperform its end market benefiting from both content expansion and share gain in heavy trucks, and we continue to expect sensors to grow mid-single digits year-over-year, as I previously mentioned.", "In Industrial Solutions for the year, organic growth guidance of low-single digits is consistent with the guidance we've been giving since the start of the year, reflecting continued improvement in industrial markets. And in Communications, we expect it to be up high-single digits organically, a further improvement versus our prior view, reflecting continued strength in our appliances and growth in data and devices. Our guidance relating to SubCom is being maintained that we're going to grow high-single digits in that business.", "In summary, I feel very good about our portfolio and execution and believe we are well-positioned to deliver growth ahead of our markets. As Heath mentioned, we've established levers to drive earnings growth and continue to perform well against our business model, and this year's results represent best-in-class performance with 7% organic growth, expanded operating margins and 20% adjusted EPS growth that these results truly demonstrate the execution along all the levers we have in our business model.", "Lastly, before I go to Q&A, I want to close by thanking our employees all around the world for their continued strong execution and commitment to our customers.", "So, with that, Sujal, let's open it up for questions.", "Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Okay. Thank you. Lisa, could you please give the Q&A instructions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Heath or Terrence, can you address the margins in the Transportation segment? How much of this sort of headwind that you're calling out here in 3Q and 4Q, were due to factory issues versus expedited shipping or other supply chain reasons? And can you quantify the headwind that you saw in the third quarter, and I will follow-up?", "Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Good morning, Wamsi. Thanks for the question. Certainly with these growth rates that we're seeing in Transportation, both from improved market conditions that have continued throughout the year, as well as our ability to well outperform those and the volume that's driven for us has created some inefficiencies in terms of our supply chain keeping up with us in that regard.", "Most all of it is a type of material constraint, and then the higher cost for expedited freight taking of our customers. So we're working through that. I would say that there's a plan in place to get this remediated, but we do expect to continue to see some of this headwind in our fiscal fourth quarter and into the early part of 2018, albeit as we correct some of those issues, it won't be quite as impactful on the numbers. But I would say that it's worth a couple of hundred basis \u2013 it's worth not a couple of hundred basis points, it's worth 20 to 30 basis points if we look at it overall.", "Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And Terrence you've shown some really nice growth here in the Transportation segment despite weak auto production concerns and the backdrop remaining somewhat still challenged from a auto production perspective. So as these results look increasingly decoupled from production trends, can you maybe address what you are doing to drive this content growth in the broader Transportation segment, and can you talk about the visibility that you have in this content growth.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thank you, Wamsi, for the question. But let me take it because it is something what we think about our Transportation business model, first it always starts with a global picture. And I think one of the things that we're very fortunate about where we drive growth it's just not in one region in the world it's across the world. And even as production has slowed down to 1% and pretty much in line with where we are, it does come back to how do we drive across the three big trends that are happening in the vehicle.", "And we've continuously shown content growth, and it has been accelerating both from our focus as you think about not only what's happening in the connected car or in safety applications, but also benefiting from everything that happens around the powertrain whether it's on combustion engine that needs to get more fuel efficient towards the adoption of electric vehicles that while we talk electric vehicles and you really think about it, we get very excited around where electric vehicles are going in China.", "So it is along all three dimensions both with where safety applications go, certainly the emission and the green go and also around the connected. And what we feel very proud of if you went back five years ago, our content per vehicle in a car was around $50. Today, it's well over $60, and we with the programs that we are winning, we see that content momentum continuing to increase. And when you take the results that we have in a 1% production environment, like we've had in quarter three as well as what we expect really in quarter four, growing mid-single-digit shows the content momentum we have. And I just think we continue to demonstrate it and we feel very good about the program ramps will continue to allow us to have that type of separation even as global production stays at a low-single-digit to flat environment that we're in.", "Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thanks. Thanks for the color.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thank you, Wamsi.", "Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thank you, Wamsi. Could we have the next question, please?", "Operator", "That comes from Shawn Harrison, Longbow Research. Please go ahead.", "Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC", "Good morning, everyone. Terrence, wanted to follow up just on the auto content particularly in EVs. Maybe if you could just discuss your content per vehicle in light of the fact that UK now says they are phasing out combustion engines. But from what I can gather, it sounds like you have a high market share in a lot of the connectivity products that go into EVs, but maybe discuss the content per vehicle and how that's been growing over time?", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Yeah. So let me talk about EV. And I always do think, Shawn, it's important to make sure when you talk EV about \u2013 close to 90 million cars are made in the world, and today, there's about 4 million that are electric vehicles whether it's pure electric or plug-in hybrid, et cetera. So, what's really \u2013 what we like about that is you do have your emission regulation to drive that increase, but when you sit there, we see the opportunity to that type of level to quadruple of the amount of electric type vehicles over the next five years. And when you see that, clearly, that creates higher demand for power and voltage connections that also gets into things we do from our very high-current relay-type products, as well as you get into sensing that occurs there.", "And when you sit there, that really comes down to the energy management that gets into the harsh environment. So the whole environment that you have there really plays to our strength of our engineers and how we have to work with our customers to really make this volume grow.", "When you think about from a content, on a traditional combustion engine, due to the trends I just talked about, what occurs on that combustion on a model, we typically get about 1.5 multiple of content to a hybrid and then about 2x content increase on a pure electric. So if something has $60 today of content on a vehicle, an opportunity to get closer to $100 on a hybrid and you could go up to basically $120 on a full electric is the simplest way to think about it.", "So that's the excitement we have around the content growth, and that comes into the emissions. So we think we're very well-positioned, we think we're positioned globally in all regions of the world around the players in that market and it is part of our content growth story of how we position ourselves and it's investments we've been making.", "Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC", "Extremely helpful. And as a follow-up, I wanted to dig into the comment of \u2013 I think the comment was your orders are being constrained by other issues in the supply chain. And so, you're under shipping true demand right now, is that the way to read it, or I guess, or is the worry that you could see orders cancelled if supply of these other products convey? I wasn't exactly sure how to read that comment of.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "I would guess it's a fair question, but really what it is, is what we're seeing is in certain parts of the supply chain, you see this in some areas and so forth as lead times have expanded, we've seen some customer behavior place orders now that are a little bit more extended. So when we typically think about our orders, our orders are typically pretty current. We typically have orders that are for the current quarter or further out.", "We've seen some extended placement out, it is not that we're under shipping demand it's just that I would say people are making sure their supply chains are lined up for as they are doing production because they've been surprised in certain categories. So it's why when we look at our double-digit order growth, our guidance is more mid-single digit growth in the fourth quarter because we see orders placed out to the far first fiscal quarter and into second fiscal quarter. I don't see them being cancelled. I just think there will be things that will smooth out over time.", "Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC", "Your lead times in this are pretty normal.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "I would say when you take our lead times, collectively, yes, they're pretty normal. There are some pockets, like Heath talked about on his automotive question, as well as some of our businesses where you see 14% and 20% growth. They've extended a certain product category, but it's very pocketed, not broad based.", "Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Perfect. And congrats on the results, guys.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thanks, Shawn.", "Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thank you, Shawn. Could we have the next question please?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks a lot. I have two questions as well, guys. I guess, first off, just on the auto growth that you guys are seeing this quarter, is there a way to think about how much of that \u2013 what's the fill in for December quarter versus things getting pushed out? Trying to get a sense on apples-to-apples how good is the autos for December versus to your point things getting a little bit more extended over here?", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Yeah. I think it's pretty pure actually, Amit. So when you sit there, I think it's pretty pure. Things getting extended, I would not say. The automotive supply chain stays pretty tight, and that's why we have some of the extra cost to make sure we do not disappoint our customers. But in auto itself, I would say, when you look at the growth we've had, it doesn't pull in meaningfully or push out meaningfully because that's why we've had the extra cost.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Got it. And then, I guess, Heath, I have a question for you on the OpEx, and just broadly how we should think about the OpEx run rate and trends as we go forward. You've talked that a fair amount and middle of the P&L focus and I think your SG&A has actually gone up faster than revenue growth so far this year. So just talk about the initiatives you have, and what's the right way to baseline OpEx as we go forward from here?", "Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "That's a good question, Amit. The year-over-year numbers on our OpEx are driven by a variety of things, including some of the bolt-on acquisitions as they layer into the P&L, with their full cost structures in play. But there are some things that we did specifically in the quarter, and we will continue to do at least in the short term, some things that we are investing ahead of our ability to take out some costs. So there's some things that we've done in terms of outsourcing and so forth.", "We've had to spend a little bit of money ahead of when we'll see those savings. And that's part of the overall strategy to reduce SG&A as a percentage of sales. Sequentially, we made a little bit of improvement on SG&A as a percentage of sales. But we are up year-over-year. And some of it is the spending ahead of those cost reductions.", "And then, there's also just some performance compensation related costs given where the results are coming in this year. So there's a variety of things that are in there. I'd say as you look forward the strategy continues, and it's pretty broad-based across the company to better align our SG&A percentage of sales but we are also \u2013 some of that is to fund \u2013 reinvest it to fund other parts of the company, specifically where we have growth platforms that \u2013 we have a very strong pipeline and opportunity set there. So we'll continue to refine this and tighten this up. But there was a variety of things that drove the increased overall OpEx in the quarter.", "Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Perfect. Thank you, guys.", "Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "All right. Thank you, Amit. Could we have the next question, please.", "Operator", "We have a question from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.", "Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yes, thanks. I have a two-part question on automotive and then a follow-up. So, in autos, can you talk about just given some of the lingering concerns about North American weakness in that market just how you guys kind of look at the sensitivity to that. I think North America is 20% or less of your auto business, but if you could just update on that. And then, the second part of the automotive question, just an update on the timing of the sensor design win pipeline and kind of timing for revenue.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Sure, Craig. Let me take that, and I think when you think about North America automotive, I want to take a step back and frame global automotive first. We have to realize there's 90 million cars, plus or minus, made on the planet and 17 million of those cars are made in the United States. So I do think we have to remember, 50 million of the cars made in the planet are in Asia, and well in the mid-20s are made in Europe. So North America while we live in every day as Americans, it is the minor part of production when you think about it globally.", "Our automotive business in North America, and we look at this year, like I said, we have about mid-single-digit growth here in the quarter. So we have the same content trends but the size or sensitivity is only about $800 million of total TE. So, it's only about 6%. And even as you said North America automotive production went down 5%, and we decline with it, it would be $40 million of revenue and a couple of pennies. So, I think about it, I think it gets a little bit too much press when you think about TE versus our great global position we have in automotive. And if we correct it by 5% production, it will be couple of cents in the big picture. So, certainly we won't want to see that, but it won't be a big thing in the big picture of TE.", "On sensors, your second question, when we sit there our turf momentum that we talked to you about in many quarters is continuing. And what we really appreciate is that the programs that we're winning across the sensor portfolio that we got with mesh (39:40) the wins we're getting with our customers are across humidity, pressure, force, position, et cetera. So what's really great is across the whole product set, which is what we were excited about, and it's also across all regions of the world. It's not concentrated. So I think it does show the momentum that we really have strength in the automotive with our great sales team and go-to market resources.", "From the momentum, it hasn't really changed. We are industrializing some of the programs. We expect to have revenue in the second half 2018. As we have we'll continue updating you on it, but it continues like we talked about last quarter and previously. So really good momentum.", "Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. And then, as my follow-up. Heath, I wanted to talk on the tuck-in of Hirschmann. I know it's a small-sized deal, but I think one of the issues with the investment community has just been kind of the acquisition strategy or multiples paid. In this case, it looks like around onetime sales. And so, just wanted you to kind of frame how you're approaching M&A at this point and things we could expect in terms of the process?", "Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Sure. In the deal \u2013 well, the deal hasn't closed. We have discussed it as we're getting closer to that. Hirschmann, it's a nice product line, tuck-in for our auto business, bring some great antenna technology where we see some nice synergies that we will realize as we bring them forward through our channel, our auto channel.", "So we looked at that as an opportunity both from where does it help us from an overall return profile and where are the synergy opportunities, and we're able to identify several things, especially on the commercial side; and then on the operation side, there's some things we'll bring to the table as well.", "So it aligns really well with the way I would think about bolt-on M&A, things that come in and we can get at reasonable valuations, and that we bring something to the table that as under our ownership there's value created for the shareholders.", "So this is not one that's far afield from what we do today. We understand the technology, we understand where it sits on the car, we understand how it aligns with what we do already in the connector and sensor world. So it's a nice opportunity for the team, and I think our team did a really nice job identifying the opportunities and have plans to execute right out of the gate.", "Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Thanks for that.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thanks, Craig.", "Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thanks, Craig. Could we have the next question. please.", "Operator", "And that comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Just a follow-up on the earlier question on sensors. As that starts to deploy, can you talk about the margin implications for the auto segment? I know we talked about plus or minus 20% now, but my understanding is that the sensor portfolio is less than half of that right now. So where can that go, and what do you think that could do for your more or like medium-term outlook for margins in that segment?", "Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Hey, Joe. This is Heath. First of all, good morning. That's a fair question. Listen, our sensors business is an area that we are investing in, and we are investing now ahead of the growth, but we're pretty confident because we've won several platforms that we'll see even some kick into production in late 2018, and we're really \u2013 we'll see the benefit of the volume from that in 2019, 2020, and so on. And that pipeline continues.", "From a profitability perspective, there is no doubt that it is dilutive to the overall segment average. Now, just to qualify that, we do carry a lot of intangible amortization in that particular BU, that business unit, because of the Measurement acquisition that was done almost three years ago.", "So, I don't know that we'll ever again on a GAAP basis, I don't know that we'll ever get to the 20% from sensors. But sensors margins have improved significantly year-over-year as we've seen them improve, but we would expect them to ultimately be in the mid-teens from an operating margin perspective, given the growth opportunities in some of the investments that is required there. We're not there yet though, and I think we're still couple of three years away. But we're moving a couple of hundred of basis points a year.", "Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Great. And then to follow up on SubCom. Can you maybe frame us the cyclical outlook for this business? I know it's structurally probably in a better position now than it's been like maybe potentially ever, given who your customer base has evolved towards, but given your pipeline here, how long do you think this cycle can extend here, and how would you frame out like where trough level in the current dynamic looks versus where we've seen historically?", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Hey, Joe. Thanks for the question. It's Terrence. And great question. I think when you think about SubCom, you're right on. When you think about the customer dynamics versus where they were 5 to 10 years ago, it's clearly a customer dynamic that you actually have the real user relay to the business model doing it. So that's always a plus and I feel very good how our team been executing organic wins with those important customers.", "When you think about it, this year we're going to be a little bit below $1 billion, and I think as you look into next year, I think our fair assumption is sort of keep that flattish because we do get to a level of capacity constraints as well as have orders that are coming in and the routes we're building.", "I think as we sit there, some of the things that we continue to think through is what are the next routes to those customer needs, how do we schedule that. So, it does not feel to us that you would have the trough cycle we've had in the past when you had customer dry up or customers be impacted by financing cycle because these customers do have capital and do not need capital markets.", "So we're still in the middle of what trough is, but it still feels like a business that the trough is much higher. I think it begun probably in the $700 million to $1 billion range, is what we've been telling people, but I would say we're still trying to figure that out.", "Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC", "You think trough can be $700 million is that what you just said?", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Yes.", "Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Versus, like, half of that last time right?", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Yes.", "Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thank you, Joe. Can we have the next question please.", "Operator", "We have a question from Matt Sheerin with Stifel.", "Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yes. Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Just first question a follow-up to Shawn's question regarding the lead time issues and the fact that you're seeing extended backlog from customers. But as you look at the non-transportation markets this quarter, Terrence, it looks like it's in line to maybe still a little bit better than seasonal. So, is there a sense that customers are building any buffer inventory and can you get a read on those inventories and probably easier for you to look at that distribution which is a smaller percentage of your revenue, but in terms of what you're seeing there in terms of inventories?", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Yeah. Matt, you're exactly right. So, let me take it from what we're seeing through our channel partners because when you go outside of Transportation and you're into our Communications segment excluding SubCom as well as our Industrial segment, you do have about 40%, 50% of those businesses go through distribution. So I think that's the right way. It's just the latter part is how you asked it.", "What we're seeing, we're seeing right now through our channel partners, they're having point-of-sale out that's pretty much high-single digit and their inventory has been very flat. So we don't see inventory building up in the channel and staying very consistent with where it's been. So, we don't see creep up there. And the order rates that we're having from our channel partners were pretty similar to our company average in a low-double digit.", "So, the dynamics we're seeing through distribution, I would say, are consistent overall. We're not seeing inventory getting ahead of itself. And I would just say when we look at those markets from a direct customer where we service the larger customers direct, it does feel like it's demand. I mean, we're seeing improving markets globally, and what we're seeing and how we're seeing it is these are due to production increases by our customers where we deal with customers directly and not through our channel partners.", "Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Great. And just as a follow-up. Terrence, in your closing comments, you talked a little bit about thoughts for fiscal 2018 in terms of at least the seasonal start to the year. But as you look out at your various end markets going into next year, obviously, you're seeing accelerated growth. What are your general thoughts about the sustainability of that growth by end market, if you can?", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "We'll guide, Matt, when we get to our first quarter call. So, I just think some observations I would make as we exit there. I talked about, certainly, I think with what we're seeing, we would expect a seasonal coming out of the quarter four and the quarter one. I think when you take the bigger picture, and I think about next year, number one is the content growth story we have in automotive, I think, is very evident of the traction we have. And I think it's fair to assume that automotives, being in this flat to plus 1% production environment where we are right now, would continue into next year. And I think we've been very clear that we think we can grow mid-single digit in it.", "I think when you get into the industrial markets, I see them improving. So I think sort of where we're running right now, our strength in the medical market certainly what we're seeing along factory automation applications which is real demand when we see it with the servos, the drives, the robotics. We're seeing that and we're winning in those applications. And certainly, medical. We talked about being a mid to high single digit grower.", "And the Communications area. I think SubCom, back to Joe's question, I think I would think about that being flat next year. And then in D&D and appliances, I think you would have things that would be closer to where those markets are, after a really hot year. So I think that's the way I would probably think about the growth going into next year just sitting here today. And we'll give you our formal guidance when we talk to you in November. But that's just, as you all think about it maybe some ways to frame it, based upon what we're seeing here without formally guiding.", "Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thanks so much.", "Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thank you, Matt. Could we have the next question, please.", "Operator", "From Jim Suva with Citibank.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Thanks very much and congratulations on the results.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thanks Jim.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "When we look at the outlook and maybe my math is wrong, are margins going to be down year-over-year in the September quarter, and is that due to the extra week, or how should we think about the puts and takes around the margins year-over-year, not sequential, but year-over-year?", "Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Jim, when we discuss our Q4 and we discuss what we think about when we guided the organic outlook, as well as how we will talk about it here in 90 days when we get on the call, it's going be apples to apples year-over-year on a 13-week quarter that we discuss for fiscal \u2013 for of Q4 2016. But we would not expect. We do not expect any year-over-year leakage on our operating income margin.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. So, you're saying the year-over-year operating margin should be up then?", "Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Yes. On an equivalent 13-week to 13-week basis.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "On an equivalent. Got you. Okay. And then my last question is, one thing to note is the margin increase in the Communications Solutions was very big. Is that completely sustainable? Is it due to revenues? Was there anything in there, or should we just equate that to kind of the go-forward improvement in your Communications profitability?", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Jim, when you look at \u2013 it's Terrence, I think there is two pieces to it. The biggest piece is the efforts we've done over the last three years to get that business focused on high speed and move away from the consumer device base primarily. So when you look at the big growth, it's really the culmination of the cost actions as well as the focus of the portfolio that we did in that segment mainly around D&D.", "Secondarily, we also did get benefit. SubCom had a very strong organic growth of 22%. So that's also contributing to the increase. I think longer term you should think about the segment margins staying around mid teens, depending upon where the businesses are, but that's where I think you can think about it, but a lot of that margin improvement was structural impact that we've been driving over the past three years that we've talked to you all about.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Great. Thank you very much for the details. That's greatly appreciated.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thanks, Jim.", "Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thank you, Jim. Could we have the next question, please?", "Operator", "We have a question from William Stein with SunTrust.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Great. Thanks for taking my question, and good morning. Terrence, I think you mentioned that there were supply constraints that were limiting the fiscal Q4 revenue that perhaps if there weren't shortages, for example, and imagining that's passives, that revenue could be higher. Any quantification on that?", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "No. Well, just to make sure what I said maybe I wasn't clear, when we look at that, it's just our orders have been placed on us because people are worried about the extended supply chain, and we were impacted by that. Our revenue is going to be pretty pure. I don't see anything impacting. I wouldn't say our revenue in the fourth quarter. It's just our orders were higher.", "On the items that Heath talked about, maybe around Transportation, it's not related to passives. This would be base metals, some plastics, things that we actually use on our manufacturing that because our demand was higher, certainly a good problem to have, and it has created inefficiencies not only in the extended supply chain, but also bringing in our factories, we had to do more changeovers to make sure we didn't disappoint our customers, which we're always going to do. So, hopefully that clarifies it.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Appreciate that clarification. It helps. One more, if I can. You noted or someone noted, Hirschmann. I think there was another acquisition that was announced recently. Can you remind us what the total revenue impact is, and then I believe that revenue from those acquisitions is not included in guidance. Maybe those deals haven't closed yet. Can you clarify this?", "Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "The other deal we closed which was a small tuck-in within our medical space was a business called MicroGroup. I'd say we have not even closed on Hirschmann yet. So the impact in the fourth quarter is going to be very, very small in terms of what the combined impact of the two deals are.", "I think if you're modeling for next year, those two deals will probably add about a point of total growth for the company on the top line and we're still working through what the bottom line impact would be as we get through all the purchase price accounting and so forth. But not a huge number as the first year as we work through some of the integration plan. It will add about a point of revenue at this point for next year's revenue.", "William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Thanks and congrats on the great quarter.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thanks.", "Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thanks, Will. Can we have the next question, please?", "Operator", "We have a question from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.", "Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Yes. Good morning, and thanks so much for taking the questions. Two questions for me. The first I was just hoping you can elaborate a bit more on China auto. I know that was very robust in the December quarter. It sounds like it stayed pretty strong throughout the year. I think even in June, China auto was good. So, maybe you can talk about how sustainable and what you're thinking about in terms of your views on China auto into next year.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Yeah. Sure. China auto as we spoke early in the year was extremely strong back in that first quarter as the incentives were benefiting, and you saw it in the registrations. You saw it in their production. What's been nice is, China auto is sort of have played out as we expected. It was a little stronger in the first half, but as it worked down post the incentive, it's been in line with what we have expected. And the other thing that's very nice to your point, you're starting to see registrations turn positive, and what we've also seen is that dealer inventories are back to normal levels in China around \u2013 we typically like to see them around 40 days and that's where they're at.", "So it doesn't feel like there's a hangover of where production is. And so, when we look forward, clearly, we'll have a compare that we'll have to deal with them in the first quarter, but we see the content story being very strong, and I think China will continue to have production growth. So, very positive on it and it's actually nice that it's come in line with how we expected.", "Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Yeah. That's helpful. And a follow-up question on the Industrial margins. Could you just better explain what the reasons are that the Industrial margins have been soft, and is there any quantification of what kind of benefits we can see from the actions that the company was discussing on the call to improve those for next quarter?", "Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Sure, Mark. The pressure on the Industrial margins year-over-year was almost entirely out of the commercial aerospace area where we were down year-over-year that \u2013 our commercial aerospace margins tend to be pretty profitable and now ahead of the segment average. So when we see a decline in that space, that does have an impact on the segment margins.", "There were also some things that we're doing that impacted the margins. As I mentioned earlier, some of the spend ahead of the cost reductions that layered into the Industrial margins as well. But we're committed to improving the overall segment margins. We see a path towards that. There will be some footprint consolidation pieces that are part of that and that will take some time, and we'll continue to quantify that as we move forward.", "But we do see our fourth quarter if we just look in the near term we see the Industrial margins year-over-year and sequentially to see a pretty significant improvement based on just where we see the mix, and where things are heading there right now. But there's a longer journey there for the Industrial margins over the next couple of years. We look forward as we get further along in that journey to discussing it more externally.", "Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thank you.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Okay. Thank you, Mark.", "Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thank you, Mark. Could we have the next question please?", "Operator", "And we have a question from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.", "Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to dig a bit into the Subsea segment where you're having a positive cycle. I think historically when Subsea has been at the bottom of the cycle, that's been dilutive to margins and when you're at the top of the cycle, it's been accretive. Now with this new range and a higher trough, do you see the business as being as dilutive in a trough year or is that going to be more similar to typical Communications margins as we move forward with this different range?", "And then, my second question would be, where should we think about the tax rate next year, given you've had some tax benefits this year? Thank you.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Hi, Sherri. Thank you for the question. First on Subsea and then I'll let Heath do taxes. On Subsea, I think when you look at it, when we talk about it historically, it would be \u2013 it has a benefit in an up cycle SubCom and if you went down the trough, how you look at it. It is a very strong business model from an ROIC no matter where you are.", "I do think it would be slightly dilutive to the Communication margins in the lower part of the cycle, but clearly not as dilutive if you were much lower like it has been in other parts of the cycle. So, I think you can think about it a little bit more linearly. Clearly, and always margin comes into which are the projects we have going, which projects we want, but I think when you think of it from a volume basis, clearly it won't be as dilutive as it was before. And Heath, I'll let you talk about taxes.", "Heath Mitts - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Well, Sherri, forecasting a tax rate is fairly volatile just given how complex and where we operate in the world in the structure and not to mention what goes on with the world with various tax authorities and the changes that we have to react to. So, I would say if you're going to model it, model it around 19% for next year. We said the longer term rate is 19% to 20%, and we'll continue to give you update understanding that at any given quarter, there's going to be things that swing it around higher or lower, but I'd say 19% if you're thinking about next year is pretty good rate to be thinking about.", "Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Terrence R. Curtin - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Thanks, Sherri.", "Sujal Shah - TE Connectivity Ltd.", "Okay. Thank you, Sherri. If there's no further questions, I want to thank everybody for joining us on the call this morning, and if anybody does have questions, please contact Investor Relations at TE.

Please go ahead.", "Sujal Shah", "Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's fourth quarter fiscal year 2017 results. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Terrence Curtin and Chief Financial Officer, Heath Mitts.", "During the course of this call, we'll be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release. In addition, we'll use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning, and we ask you to review the sections of our press release and accompanying slide presentation that address the use of these items.", "Press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com.

I'm very pleased to share our strong results for the fourth quarter, which capped off an exceptional year for TE across all the value drivers of our business model, including sales growth, earnings growth, as well as capital generation and deployment. Before I get into the slides, I want to spend a few minutes highlighting the progress we've made, demonstrating a successful execution of our strategy to create a safer, sustainable, productive and connected future. We are focused on attractive markets fueled by content growth and our sales growth this year is evidence of this. ", "Our portfolio is solid with clear competitive advantages that have the ability to consistently deliver above market growth. Also, our customers value our ability to provide highly engineered solutions into applications where failure is not an option. To put this into context, to value creating for owners in 2017, we delivered 9% recorded revenue growth and 8% organic growth, which we believe is best in class performance versus our industrial technology peers. ", "Adjusted operating margins expanded by 110 basis points to 16.8% with expansion in all three of our segments. And both the sales and the operating margin expansion resulted in adjusted earnings per share growth of 22%, which demonstrates the strength of our business model and resulted in performance above our guidance.", "For the full year, we delivered record free cash flow of $1.7 billion, which represents 100% free cash flow conversion to net income. We also returned $1.2 billion to shareholders and added two acquisitions that bolt on nicely to existing platforms in our portfolio, reflecting our balanced capital deployment strategy. We're also pleased that our return on invested capital expanded by over 100 basis points during the year to nearly 15%.", "As we look forward into fiscal \u201918, we are expecting another year of strong performance, above the markets we serve with 6% revenue growth, 4% on an organic basis and double digit growth in adjusted earnings per share, after netting out the impact of tax and currency. Heath and I will get into more detail on guidance later in a call.", "So let\u2019s get in to the slides and I\u2019d ask that you turn to slide 3 and let me cover some additional highlights for the fourth quarter. We delivered record performance above our guidance for the fourth quarter with double digit revenue and earnings per share growth. Sales were $3.5 billion, representing 12% reported growth and 9% organic growth year-over-year. Also, organic orders were up 11% in total, reflecting 16% growth in Asia and 9% growth, both in the Americas and in Europe. ", "Our sales were approximately $200 million above the midpoint of our guidance, driven by upside across all three of our segments. This strong revenue growth and related margin conversion resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $1.25 in the quarter, $0.10 above the midpoint of our guidance. From an organic growth perspective by segment, transportation grew 13%, industrial grew 6% and our communications segment grew 4%. With the backdrop of the strong growth, we demonstrated strong execution with adjusted operating margins expanding 70 basis points to 16.7%.", "If you could please turn to slide 4, let me cover some more highlights related to the full fiscal year of \u201917. We delivered sales of $13.1 billion and this was up 9% on a reported and 8% on an organic basis. From an organic growth perspective, we grew our sales by $1 billion in 2017, with all of our segments contributing. Transportation grew 11% versus global oil production growth of 3%, demonstrating consistent outperformance versus the market due to content growth trends as well as our strong global position. ", "Industrial solutions grew 4% driven by continued momentum in both factory automation as well as medical applications. And our communications segment grew 7% with growth across all three of our businesses. For the year, adjusted operating margins were 16.8% with expansion in all three of our segments, demonstrating our strong operational execution in 2017 and this resulted in us delivering adjusted earnings per share of $4.83, which was up 22% over the prior year.", "Now, let me get into order trends, so if you can please move to slide 5. We continue to see broad based strength in our orders across our segments, which reinforces our growth outlook for the first quarter. Total orders, excluding SubCom, were similar to our third quarter, at $3.3 billion. Our orders were up 12% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 10% organically. ", "Organically, excluding SubCom, our orders grew evenly at approximately 10% across all three regions, continuing the balanced demand trends we have been seeing over the past few quarters. By segment, in transportation, our orders increased 11% organically with growth in all regions. Our industrial orders grew 8% organically with growth in all regions and particular strength in Asia, which showed double digit growth. In communications, excluding SubCom, we saw year-over-year organic order growth of 6%, which strengthened in both appliances as well as data and devices.", "Let me now talk about our performance by segment and if you could please turn to slide 6, I\u2019ll start with transportation. Transportation sales grew 13% organically year-over-year and operating margins were in line with our expectations and impacted by supply chain issues we discussed last quarter. Segment sales exceeded expectations due to strong auto demand in both Europe as well as in China. Our leading position in the heavy truck market had shown growth in sensors. ", "Our auto sales were up 10% organically with mid-single digit growth in the Americas, mid teen growth in Europe and high single digit growth in Asia against the global auto production growth of only 1%. We are consistently demonstrating the ability to outperform the market due to content growth and we expect this trend to continue. We also expect the benefit from new program ramps as we move forward, which will also contribute to our outperformance versus vehicle production levels. In commercial transportation, we continued to outperform the market with organic revenue growth of 37% year-over-year and particular strength in Asia. ", "This significant outperformance is driven by a combination of increased content from regulations to China as well as share gains from our leading global position. We saw double digit growth in each region with continued momentum in heavy trucks as well as growth in the agriculture, mining and constructions markets. While we do expect the China heavy truck market to moderate as we move through \u201918, we expect to continue to see revenue growth ahead of market growth rates. In sensors, our business grew 9% organically year-over-year with growth in auto, commercial transportation and the industrial markets. ", "We continue to generate strong design win momentum, particularly in auto applications we're winning across a broad range of sensing products as well as technologies. Adjusted operating margins for the segment were in the range of our expectations and were impacted by approximately 150 basis points from the near term supply chain efficiencies we highlighted last quarter. We expect this issue to be largely behind us by the end of this quarter with December quarter margins returning to above 19%, which is in line with our target model.", "If you can please turn to page 7 and let me move over to the industrial solutions segment. The growth momentum we started to see in the second quarter of our fiscal 2017 continues with 6% organic growth year-over-year in the fourth quarter. This organic growth was driven by 13% growth in industrial equipment, which was -- with particular strength in both factory automation as well as medical applications. Our positions in these markets coupled with the acquisition completed last year driving strong growth ahead of the market, both on a reported and on an organic basis. ", "Both the Intercontec and Creganna acquisitions continue to perform exceptionally well and ahead of our expectations. In our aerospace and defense and marine business, we saw 1% organic growth driven by the defense market partially offset by program timing in commercial aerospace, which continues to be sluggish. Our energy business declined 2% organically due to weakness in Europe. Adjusted operating margins for the segment expanded 80 basis points year over year in line with our expectations. Our adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 150 basis points year-over-year, demonstrating the performance of the business, excluding the impact from acquisition related amortization.", "Please turn to page 8, so let me get into the communications solutions. Communications solutions delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of growth with 4% organic growth and 430 basis points adjusted operating margin expansion, up to 16.4% and this is through both a combination of the growth we\u2019re experiencing and the operational improvements we\u2019ve made in the segment. ", "Data and devices delivered 6% organic growth as we continue to benefit from growth of high speed solutions and because of our multi-year transformation, our D&D business doubled at suggested operating margin from a year ago, driving significant improvement at the segment level as the actions we took to focus the portfolio and optimize the operations were really taking hold. Appliances had another strong quarter with 10% organic growth as demand remains strong, particularly in Asia. ", "Our performance this year is a result of share gains and the benefits of the strong China air conditioning cycle. We do expect the cycle to moderate in China as we move through 2018 and we continue to expect our client business to grow globally above market rates in fiscal 2018. In SubCom, our business declined slightly as a result of program timing, while we continue to have a solid pipeline of new opportunities. Hopefully, you saw that this week we announced a new transpacific program that connects Asia to the United States through the consortium of parties, including cloud customers. With this win we announced, our backlog now stands at approximately $1 billion.", "Please turn to slide 9 and let me cover the segment highlights for the full year. I really like how the slide shows the progress we made across all segments and when you sit here, overall for the full year, we had exceptional performance in the transportation segment with 11% organic growth and 40 basis points of adjusted operating margins to 19.4%. We do expect another year of above market growth in fiscal 2018 and operating margins to be in our normalized range of 20% plus or minus for the full year. Our industrial solutions segment delivered 11% reported growth and 4% organic growth for the full year with contribution from all the businesses. ", "Adjusted operating margins expanded 50 basis points to 12.7% driven by both growth and the operational improvements we\u2019re making in this segment and we expect another year of mid-single digit organic growth and margin expansion in 2018. In communications, it clearly had a phenomenal year in 2017 and contributed to both TE\u2019s top line performance as well as margin expansion. This was driven by the 7% organic growth and almost 400 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. ", "Clearly, we made hard work in this segment, especially around data and devices business and clearly this performance at the segment shows the successful transformation as well as the growth organic from high speed solutions for the data center. Also, our appliance business grew 13% organically, reflecting our industry leading position and our SubCom business saw strong growth of 6%.", "Yeah. So I\u2019m very proud to say all segments contributed to our growth in margin expansion in 2017 and you\u2019ll also see that again in 2018.", "So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Heath to cover the financials.", "Heath Mitts", "Thank you, Terrence and good morning, everyone. If you please turn to slide 10, I\u2019ll provide more details on Q4 financials. Adjusted operating income was 576 million with an adjusted operating margin rate of 16.7% which leverages the strong organic growth of 9%. GAAP operating income was 552 million and included 23 million of restructuring charges and 1 million of acquisition charges. Adjusted EPS was $1.25, up 10% year over year, driven by sales growth, operating margin improvement and the contribution from acquisitions. ", "Excluding an $0.08 negative year-over-year impact from tax, adjusted EPS was up a strong 17%. For the quarter, our EPS performance was above our prior range and $0.10 above prior midpoint due to the strong revenue performance. GAAP EPS was $1.21 for the quarter and included restructuring charges of $0.04. For the full year 2017, restructuring charges were approximately 150 million and I expect similar levels for 2018, driven primarily by activity in our industrial solutions segment as we optimize the footprint as well as make structural improvements across TE\u2019s cost structure.", "Turning to slide 11, our strong Q4 results demonstrate that we are performing well against our business model and executing upon multiple levers to drive earnings growth, including organic revenue growth, a consistent capital deployment strategy of M&A and return capital to our owners as well as our TEOA efforts. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 33% with improvement from prior year, driven by fall through on increased volumes and productivity improvements from TEOA programs. This was partially offset by the impact of supply chain inefficiencies in our transportation segment, which Terrence already discussed. ", "Adjusted operating margins were up 70 basis points year-over-year to 16.7% with strong organic growth driving leverage in the operating structure of the company. Adjusted EBITDA margins in Q4 were 21.5%, up 80 basis points year over year. For the full year, adjusted operating margins were up 110 basis points to 60.8% with contributions from all segments. We expect further margin expansion in fiscal \u201918, while continuing to invest for growth in support of our growing design win pipeline. ", "As we\u2019ve discussed on previous calls, we\u2019re also committed to reducing SG&A as a percent of revenue overtime, while making progress. We ended 2017 with an adjusted effective tax rate of 17.4% for the full year. Going forward, I would expect more normalized full year adjusted effective tax rate of 19% to 20% for 2018, which results in a tax headwind of $0.17 in our 2018 guidance compared to our 2017 results. Our business continues to generate solid free cash flow with record Q4 and full year performance. ", "In the quarter, cash from continuing operations was 873 million, and free cash flow was 691 million. We returned 376 million to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases in the quarter. For the full year, free cash flow was a record 1.7 billion, the 100% net income conversion demonstrating a high quality of earnings. In fiscal 2017, we returned 1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and used 215 million for acquisitions. ", "Converting earnings to cash provides the ability to support both return of capital acquisitions while retaining the strong financial position. As we balanced the use of our cash flow, return on invested capital is an important metric we measure ourselves. We have made good progress this year expanding ROIC by over 100 basis points to nearly 15% as Terrence mentioned earlier. We\u2019ve included a balance sheet and cash flow summary in the appendix for additional details.", "And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Terrence.", "Terrence Curtin", "Thanks, Heath. And let me get into guidance for 2018 and I\u2019ll start with our first quarter, which is on slide 12 of the presentation. For the first quarter, we are expecting a strong start to our fiscal year. We expect first quarter revenues at $3.35 billion to $3.45 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.23 to $1.27. At the midpoint, this represents reported sales growth of 10%, organic sales growth of 5% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 9%. ", "By segment, we expect transportation solutions to grow low double digits on a reported basis, which includes the recent acquisition of Hirschmann, a leading provider of antenna technology and products and Hirschmann bolsters our position as a value added solution provider in the connected vehicle applications, truly a high growth area. On an organic basis, we expect mid-single digit growth in transportation. We expect auto to be up mid-single digits with global auto production being flat year over year, once again demonstrating outperformance due to content growth. ", "We also expect strong growth in commercial transportation and continued growth in sensors. And as I mentioned earlier, we do expect segment adjusted operating margins to above 19% in the first quarter. In industrial solutions, we expect to grow mid-single digits organically with growth driven by continued strength in both factory automation and medical applications. And in communications, we expect low single digit growth with growth in data and devices and appliances offsetting some impact from SubCom project timing for the quarter.", "Now, let me move to the full year and if you can turn to slide 13, I\u2019ll get into it. We expect full year revenue of $13.7 billion to $14.1 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $5.13 and $5.33. At the midpoint, this represents reported sales growth of 6% and organic sales growth of 4%. Bridging between the 6% total growth and organic of 4%, we do expect acquisitions and currency exchange rates to each add about 100 basis points of growth in 2018. ", "On an adjusted EPS growth is expected to be 8% at the midpoint. We expect further margin expansion in 2018 and it\u2019s important to note that the adjusted EPS guidance is negatively impacted by tax headwinds of $0.17, which Heath talked about and positively impacted by currency exchange rates of $0.05. If you net out both the tax and currency factors, our EPS guidance reflects double digit growth. In 2018, we again expect growth in all three of our segments. In transportation, we expect to be up high single digits on a reported basis and up mid-single digits organically. ", "Auto is expected to be up mid-single digits organically on 1% auto production growth this year, reflecting continued content growth and share gains. Commercial transportation is expected to continue to outperform its end market, benefiting from content expansion and share gains in heavy truck and we expect another year of growth in sensors. In industrial solutions, we expect it to grow mid-single digits on both a reported and organic basis, with the primary growth drivers being factory automation and medical applications. ", "In communications, we expect to be up low single digits both on a reported and an organic basis. In data and devices, we expect to benefit from high speed ramps in cloud infrastructure customers as well as design ramps for server OEMs. Data and devices and appliances is expected to more than offset some declines in SubCom due to program timing in 2018.", "In summary, I feel very good about our portfolio as well as our execution and believe TE is well positioned to continue to deliver profitable growth ahead of our markets. We have established levers to drive earnings growth and continue to perform well against our business model, as demonstrated by our strong fiscal results at 2017. We do look forward to sharing more with you as part of our Investor Day in December and I hope that you can join us.", "Before, we do go into Q&A, I do want to close by thanking our employees for the strong execution this past year and their continued commitment to grow TE as well as our customers.", "So now, let\u2019s open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll first go to the line of Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley.", "Craig Hettenbach", "First question on autos. Terrence, the 10% growth versus 1% production, you guys have been tracking 2 or 3 and that certainly stands out. So if you can just touch on if there's any timing elements and then as part of that question, from a sensor program perspective, any visibility in terms of when you see those new design wins ramping on the sensor side in autos?", "Terrence Curtin", "Let me take and there are two pieces. So first off on automotive, there is no timing, so there is actually, it\u2019s anyway, we\u2019re trying to catch up some of the inefficiencies we\u2019ve talked about, but really what was nice about fourth quarter was how even our [indiscernible]. We saw \u2013 earlier in the year, we had tremendous growth in Asia and as we came through the year, as China slowed a little bit, we still had the fourth quarter around 9% in Asia, 14% growth in Europe and also 5% growth in the Americas. So it\u2019s pretty broad based and really from that, I think that\u2019s where you really see the benefit. As we go forward, and I think it\u2019s reflected in our guidance, we see next year to be a pretty tempered auto production. We expect production to be flat in the first half and we expect really the 1% growth for the year to really be driven out of Asia as well as Europe, with the United States being down a little bit and we still think we\u2019re going to get the net single digit from the content growth. So we feel very good about the momentum we have and it\u2019s consistent that we can grow content above production around the trends.", "On sensors, your second question, we feel very good about the growth we had this quarter and it was across all three pieces that we sort of look at in the sensors and we had a nice growth in automotive, we had nice growth in commercial transportation as well as the broader industrial markets to grow them. The program ramps are similar to what we told you before. We expect some of the auto ramps, that will be happening more in the latter half of next year, that one you\u2019re going to see the benefits of those. And that will help in the later half but nothing has really changed from what we told you.", "Craig Hettenbach", "Got it. And then if I can just ask a follow-up for Heath, step up in buybacks this quarter, any read through to that? I know you guys have been pretty consistent about the cash return policy, but did notice that an increase in buybacks in the quarter?", "Heath Mitts", "No. Nothing has changed from a perspective of our overall capital deployment strategy. Clearly, we had good cash flow generation in the quarter, we balance that out with acquisition activity that\u2019s going on and make sure that we hold to a reasonable cash level and then return money back to the owners of the company. So nothing that\u2019s strategically changed in terms of our outlook on that.", "Operator", "That will be from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.", "Joe Giordano", "Just kind of following up on that last question, M&A outlook, I know it's a core part of your business, of your strategy. It\u2019s a part of your capital allocation program. I know your goal is to be a little bit more disciplined on price versus maybe some of the acquisitions you did historically and you're in an environment with pretty high valuations, so how are you looking at this right now and how does the pipeline look and maybe some comments on potential timing of that?", "Terrence Curtin", "Sure. And I appreciate the question. Listen, M&A activity is never as linear as you like to model it to be. The reality is, we\u2019ve got above sticks in the fire, we\u2019re probing around in all areas that you would think that we would be acquiring in. Some of the platform activity that was done in sensors and in medical has enabled us to tackle a couple of more fragmented markets where we can go after bolt-ons, we can layer in to those existing - to this platforms that we brought into the TE portfolio. But we\u2019re out there pretty aggressively right now looking for things, but to your point it is a pretty good seller's market and we have to speak to our discipline accordingly. So we are active is what I would say. I think you'll continue to see us announce a handful of Hirschmann like size deals over the next couple of years. And our goal is still to make that an important lever to our business model. But it is an expensive market, there is no doubt about it, there's a lot of competition for deals out there. So we\u2019re going to maintain our discipline, but still aggressively go out and cultivate activity.", "Joe Giordano", "And then as a follow up, you mentioned like a 150 million or so in restructuring. I just wanted to what\u2019s your internal kind of estimate for cost out from actions you've done previously into \u201918. And how should we think about 150 you\u2019re spending this year playing out. And kind to just more broadly where are you, do you think you are in this whole journey of site consolidations and kind of streamlining the production footprint of the company.", "Terrence Curtin", "Sure. I think as a rule of thumb, not all restructuring activities is treated equal right in terms of returns, but on average it\u2019s about two-year payback on the restructuring dollars that we spent on a cash payback. Obviously it depends where in the world you do these things. You could have a quicker or longer payback. But on average it\u2019s about two years. So you can model that in relative to what we spend this year and what we are going to spend next year.", "The second part of your question though about where we are in the journey. Listen, the company well before I got here, a little over a year ago had done a tremendous amount of heavy lifting in the communications solution segment, rightsizing primarily the data and device business as starting back I think as far 2012 as we walked away from about a billion dollars of revenue that was no longer going to be part of our strategic content and having to rightsizing the business for that. So over that four year journey or so you saw a lot of activity in that segment. We feel very good about the operating footprint as you think about communications solutions today.", "Our focus has churned a little more towards the industrial solutions business, just been the beneficiary of a fair number of acquisition over the last several years and there's some natural site consolidation activity that would \u2013 to optimize that footprint. And we\u2019ll softly tackle that, but it\u2019s going to take a couple to three years to get through that. And I think it's important that our customers and employees are first remind on that we don't want to do anything to disrupt what's going on there. So we\u2019re growing nicely and most pieces of our industrial solutions segment we have to contemplate that as well as we think about where we have capacity around the world. But I would envision a couple to three years would be my \u2013 if I was going to guide you to that.", "Operator", "That will be the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Wamsi Mohan", "Terrence, you reported 8% organic growth in 2017 that's pretty impressive. Guidance implies 4% organic. Can you just talk about sort of what you're seeing from an end market perspective going into \u201918? And I have a follow up.", "Terrence Curtin", "Great question Wamsi, and let me paint a little bit of backdrop. When we think about this year, I really think we did a good job capitalizing as markets improved. So first off when you think about maybe going from eight to four, I would start with transportation. We had a 3% auto production environment here, in 2017, we expect that to step down to 1%. We do believe with our content and our win, we're going to grow above market, spend in single-digit where we guided, certainly auto production is moving up from three to one. Secondly, both in transportation as well as in our CS segment, we benefited from content gain as well as share gain both in appliance and our industrial transportation business really around China. Some cycles that had some regulations and I talked about air conditioning segment in appliance.", "We do expect those markets to come back a little bit more to reality as we go and moderate through the year. But we do see growth in those markets, but we don't expect to grow as high as we had in \u201817. In industrial, I would tell you, I think we\u2019ve seen more of the same. I think the industrial markets throughout this year got more momentum as I said they become balanced across the world. And I sort of knew you are continuing to see this mid-single digit growth where we been running in the second half. And then the last thing that I would say on the bridging sort of eight to the four is, our SubCom business grew 6% last year, well over $900 million. What we're looking at next year, we expect SubCom to be $800 million to $900 million based upon the backlog that\u2019s over a billion dollars I talked about. And what\u2019s really nice about that is, we do expect our data and devices as well as appliances growth to offset even as SubCom is down a little bit. It\u2019s still a high point in cycle, but we do think its elongated. So there are some of the moving parts qualitatively that are reflected in the guidance that I talked about as part of the script and in the slides.", "Wamsi Mohan", "And I guess my follow up and it\u2019s somewhat related to your answer here, you showed pretty significant operating margin improvement and you noted some pretty strong above market trends here in fiscal \u201917. You EBIT margin improved double of what you typically expect of 50 bps and more than double and are still depressed my some supply chain inefficiencies. Your guidance is implying roughly 50 bps going into next year. And I'm just wondering why won\u2019t it be higher than that given that you still have sort of 4% organic growth and you don't have the headwinds of supply chains inefficiencies that you're sort of lapping this quarter. Thanks.", "Heath Mitts", "Part of this, as Terrence said we still have another quarter or so of the inefficiencies as we ramp that up through the calendar year. And we\u2019re taking a reasonable view where our investment levels are going to be for next year as well as where the growth is coming from and have mixed layers into that. But in general I would say we feel very good about the work that transportation teams has done to handle this revenue growth and dealing with the situation of improving what has been the efficiencies and where we see that going in terms of progress towards remediation on that. And we feel good about our ability to extend margins in the other two segments as well. So I think we\u2019re going to be off to a good start here in our first quarter and we\u2019ll continue to update you as the year progresses.", "Operator", "That will be from the line of Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research. Your line is open.", "Shawn Harrison", "Hopefully my math is right, I'm not working off a candy hangover, but if we get a two year payback on last year's restructuring program and this year\u2019s as well that's maybe 150 million I\u2019d say of I guess benefits to potentially come to the P&L. Are there any offsets, I know commodities are up or things like that that would negate kind of that easy math of 150 million of potential benefits from the two years of restructuring.", "Heath Mitts", "Well, I think the math is a little -- your math seems a little rich, but there certainly are some things. I mean we don't bridge every last thing. There's no doubt that commodity pressures are embedded in our guidance. I mean if you were to just - look at just commodities alone and freeze that today it\u2019s probably $0.10 of headwind in the quarter, I'm sorry, for the full year, if commodity prices stay where they are today, for 2018, I mean we're not going to go through all of the pieces because we've got productivity initiatives, restructuring initiatives and things like that to offset those types of things.", "But certainly it\u2019s a balanced view of where those types of cost reside as well as some of the investment level as we are. We have a very rich revenue pipeline right now across most of our businesses. And we are making investments in both OpEx as well in CapEx. So engineering and capital expenditures to make those - handle this type of outsize revenue growth relative to our market. So it\u2019s a balanced view, but certainly there's puts and takes. Restructuring impact does help us, there is no doubt, not just in the short term but in the long term in terms of the optimized footprint going forward and we're making a bestselling place as well.", "Shawn Harrison", "There's a follow up if I may, Terrence last quarter I think you may have mentioned that you're seeing a little bit of a disconnect between longer term orders relative to immediate term kind of bookings that you would guide to. Did you see that normalize a bit with distribution maybe selling matching sell through a little bit more evenly here through October.", "Terrence Curtin", "Yeah Shaw, I did mention that last quarter. And in some ways we did see some things expanding out. When you look at the orders, orders have stayed pretty consistent in quarter three, quarter four as I mentioned. The other thing I would say is we are seeing from our channel partners sell through and sell out rates, so that\u2019s selling into them and their PSO out, are marrying each other. So we see inventory turns staying very healthy, we don\u2019t see inventory building up. And from that viewpoint I think things are reasonably in balance where we see things right now. So, where things are especially in a quarter where typically they get a little weaker because in many cases their end of the year at December, staying pretty solid.", "Operator", "That will be from the line of Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is open.", "Jim Suva", "Two quick clarification questions. First was on the restructuring I believe you said 150 million, was that for fiscal year ending 2017 or outlook for 2018 and what would the outlook for restructuring cost be for 2018.", "Heath Mitts", "Jim, this is Heath. It\u2019s actually both. Approximately 150 million for 2017 and we expect similar levels for 2018.", "Jim Suva", "And the changes in tax, is that relative to your recent acquisitions or some change in tax filing or the souring of your income or how should we think about what's going on with your taxes and this rate expected to continue to increase assuming no political tax reform?", "Heath Mitts", "Our rate is not \u2013 our guidance rate of 19% to 20% for the year does not contemplate any kind of tax reform as we're not going to speculate on what that may look like. But I would tell this, you know, as global as we are, our construct is really complicated journey to through and decipher well what the moving parts are going to be on our tax rates. Some of it is jurisdictional mix in terms of the increase and the results of some. These are handful of small three things that benefited us in 2017 that we do not anticipate repeating in 2018 around statute explorations that we have reserved for that we benefited from in 2017 that do not happen again in 2018.", "But I think probably more importantly our security towards the fact that our cash tax rate was still inside of our ETR for 2017 and we\u2019ll continue to be even inside of that 19 to 20 for next year. Our cash tax rate tends to run roughly 150 basis points below our published effective tax rate which is more important metric as we think about.", "Jim Suva", "Then my last question is on the transportation, with transportation revenues being up year-over-year, the margins being down year-over-year, you mentioned supply chain inefficiencies are something. Can you go into a little bit of details of exactly what is going on there? Because I believe this is now the second quarter of that. And I think you said through the December quarter. So that would be three quarters of, it seemed like an awful long time to remedy some challenges for a company like yourself who's been in this industry for decades.", "Heath Mitts", "Well, I mean if you look at the revenue growth Jim, I mean the revenue growth is far outside of what the market growth is. And we\u2019re winning and content wins have been great of the topline. Some of the challenges that the supply chain reacting to our ability to get certain types of parts. And so there's in-sourcing activities going on, most of the cost is related to expedite freight charges, spending more money on things to get things to our customers in a more timely manner is costing us a fair amount of money to do that. I would say this, the team has done a nice job. But when you're talking about adding stamping and welding machines, it tends to be a fairly long lead times, these are not things you to go by off of a retail floor, you get order, commission them and install them and get them up and running.", "And we are aggressively doing that. I would say that the quarter we just finished that we're talking about today we peaked out in terms of those inefficiencies. We are seeing in real time that those costs are starting to come down, but it will be behind us by the end of this quarter largely. So yes, it was a three quarter journey, it happens. I would say the revenue growth, the demand for our products are real good. And we're on top of it. But there's no doubt that has caused some pain points for the team as they\u2019ve had to respond aggressively towards this. And it did impact. I think we noted in the call, it impacted segment margins by 150 basis points. So we would have grown our margins in the mid-19% range absent these inefficiencies. But we do feel good, we will back for margin rate perspective, in the first quarter back well north of 19% and feel good about where they year is going to end for transportation.", "Operator", "That will be from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Unidentified Analyst ", "This is Erwin Lu [ph] dialing in for Amit. I had a question about SubCom, you talked about the business being impacted by products timing issues. If I'm not mistaken, I think last quarter you indicated that the business would be flat year-over-year in fiscal 2018. I guess from a timing perspective, can you just provide or give us a sense of what's changed versus 90 days ago.", "Terrence Curtin", "Couple of things, SubCom is very different than the rest of our businesses. So this is much more of a project construction based business, so how projects come in, how we have to permit those projects, also how our customers want to get those charged in the project, when we look at it, it does get a little bit lumpy and it\u2019s been like that forever. So when you sit there, nothing has really changed about the business, we feel good about the backlog, being around $1 billion which is where it\u2019s been now, plus or minus a little bit for multiple years.", "And it give us confidence about this cycle being elongated versus what we\u2019ve had historically. And that cycle once again is around the need for data in our cloud provider customers and that's what\u2019s great even about our latest award includes them. So as we look into next year, like I said in my comments we look at the project timing, it looks like we\u2019re going to be in that $800 million to $900 million range as we go into next year. We\u2019ll have to see how projects fill in. but right now I don't think anything's changed from last quarter, it\u2019s just what we expected to be up at this higher point of the cycle, plus or minus a little bit.", "Unidentified Analyst ", "And just as a follow up, as I look at your communications solutions business, particularly in data devices and appliances, you indicated that growth in Asia was a major driver of your performance. Is it possible to talk about some of the underlying demand trends on sort of an ex-Asia basis?", "Terrence Curtin", "Yeah, a couple of things. So in appliances, it is your traditionally driver, so it is around appliance bills, home starts and really this year I would say outside of Asia, traditional appliance that was sort of a low single-digit market. We were able to grow faster than that due to our leading position as well as content wins we\u2019ve had. But really we benefited from an air conditioning cycle in Cycle that was much stronger and you saw all that growth throughout the year. And that in devices it\u2019s really a global business when you think about how those customers act. We did see strength in Asia really around cloud and how we sell to as the cloud builds out. But when we said they are going forward, we do see Asia will always be a big driver when it comes to data and devices just due to where the products made also where the design is done. So outside the United States isn\u2019t as relevant \u2013 outside of Asia sorry isn't as relevant for data and devices when it comes to revenue.", "Operator", "That will be from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is open.", "Steven Fox", "Two questions from me. First off, you've mentioned both content wins and market share gains. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the market share gains for a few minutes in terms of what's driving that, where they're most prevalent and assume maybe we should exclude the data business since that seems to be a specific product cycle for you guys. But outside of data, can you talk about market share gains. And I have a follow up.", "Terrence Curtin", "Certainly, there's an element of what we track Steve, both regionally and I think when you take the share gains ex-content, we feel very good about our momentum in auto. Globally we also feel very good on share momentum in our ICT business. And I would also say if you jump into industrial growth and what we've been able to accomplish in the industrial side both of the factory, automation as well as medical.", "When you get into excluding data in appliance, I would tell you we had tremendous momentum from a share gain in Asia over many years now. Taking our leading position in more of a Western position around Europe and then United States than actually has our Asian customers have become more global players then they work historically really driving share gain wins in Asia through all the major appliance manufacturers. So when you look at share gains at our ex-content or electronification, really they're the markets that we see it in and in more of our traditional products.", "Steven Fox", "And then just as a follow up, the Hirschmann acquisition obviously makes sense, but it seems to suggest maybe you're expanding your look at what you're going after in auto around connected applications. Is that correct and if so, what does it say for maybe other deals in that area or do you have enough now to do more in terms of just getting and stuff like that.", "Terrence Curtin", "Steve, on Hirschmann, I don't think I would say it\u2019s different, I do think it's things that we actually do already and how do we get a little bit deeper in it. So when you look at Hirschmann, and Hirschmann what it does is really be antenna technology and how that integrates into the [indiscernible] are some things that we've done already in our automotive business. So we get excited about it\u2019s an area where we\u2019ve had transaction organically and we do typically look at where we have traction organically for an inorganic similar to what we did [indiscernible] and similar to what we did with medical.", "But when you take Hirschmann there were things we were doing that might have been a little bit on the lower tech scale than what Hirschmann did. And what this really allows us to do is continue to build our penetration around the connected car infrastructure really around the physical network that happens in a vehicle, so that\u2019s within vehicle. So it\u2019s a natural extension of what we're doing. And we're happy to have Hirschmann as part of our team and that opens up a bigger content envelope than what we were doing historically.", "So it actually allows us to continue to building strong content momentum that we talked to you about and opens up a bigger area that we can also take Hirschmann more global than they have been because they have been very European centric and how do we take that technology with our strong auto position. So I would say it\u2019s a go-to market play, it\u2019s also getting core technology a little bit broader, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s completely different than what we do that would be the only thing I would modify from what your question was.", "Operator", "That would be from the line of Matthew Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is open.", "Unidentified Analyst ", "Hi. This is [indiscernible] on behalf of Mat Sheerin. In the past and currently you mentioned that cloud and hyper scale infrastructure has been a big driver for data and devices. Could you just be able to give more detail on the materiality in the segment as well as your growth expectations for fiscal year on that segment. Thank you.", "Terrence Curtin", "But when you take it, and I\u2019m going to talk higher level. When you take our data devices businesses, you sort of break it down. We don\u2019t have much exposure to consumer anymore and that what Heath talked about as we moved away from that to really point our engineers harsher environments. So when you think about our data devices business there's an element of it probably about 30%, 40% that relates to traditional telco infrastructure. There is an element that also relates to wireless and then there is an element that relates to the cloud.", "And certainly cloud means both servers as well as the emerging hyperscale providers that we all talk about a lot. So when you sit there really the traditional telco infrastructure has been pretty muted. I think you\u2019ve seen that. On the wireless side we are waiting for some of the 5G rollouts that are upcoming over the next couple of years to really help that piece of the pie. But clearly when you take this year, the growth has really been driven by the cloud and the our hyperscale customers. And that has created I would say almost all the growth we\u2019ve had in our data devices business this year and has offset some of the slowness in the traditional telco and wireless infrastructure. So that's the way I would ask you think about it in response to our question.", "Operator", "That would be from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Adrienne Colby", "Hi, its Adrienne Colby for Sherri Scribner, thanks for taking the question. Within industrial solutions, commercial aerospace continues to be a bit of a drag. Just wondering if you could provide some color on the ongoing timing issue. And also if you could talk about the trends you're seeing in oil and gas, just trying to understand better what was going on energy in the quarter.", "Terrence Curtin", "So let me your first question, so in commercial aerospace, clearly that\u2019s about almost 50% of what we do in our aerospace and defense business. And when you sit there and the contact what we have we feel very good about, both with -- both airplane manufacturers. What we\u2019ve seen a sluggishness throughout the supply chain on build rates, and really that\u2019s been something that has been happening all year. So we feel very good with the content and clearly as that momentum picks up as build rates and the supply chain were through that\u2019s a sluggishness we\u2019re talking about.", "On oil and gas, oil and gas in not our energy business, our energy business is much more around power transmission, distribution and generation. The oil and gas businesses at our aerospace and defense submarine business and I would say that business was very flat this year. We continue to see stabilization in that market, but we expect slight growth next year, but it\u2019s still running around $120 million per annum. And we not expecting some big rebound in that as we go through our 2018 guidance.", "Operator", "That will be from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This is [indiscernible] on for Mark, thank you for taking the question. My first question is on automotive. How is TE thinking about the increased auto purchase tax in China in 2018 within its guidance?", "Terrence Curtin", "When you sit there, we look at auto production. And so right now when we're sitting there, we do sort of view auto production next year in China to be relatively flat to this year of low-single digit. So when we sit there clearly this year, we had very strong growth, about 9% production growth in China. So as the incentives have worked off and the facts you talked about, we do expect more muted China production next year and that\u2019s included in our 1% global auto production.", "Despite that we feel very comfortable that we\u2019re going to grow mid-single digit on that backdrop of global production. And what\u2019s really nice about our global positioning in automotive is we really see that Europe will be a big growth driver in next year based upon our contact wins. So you're going to hear us talk a little bit more about Europe as we go into next year, while this year has been very much around China and Asia in automotive. You are going to see our European based upon our great global position that we have.", "Unidentified Analyst ", "And as a follow up, the sequential revenue guide in 1Q fiscal \u201918 is more benign than typical seasonality. Can you discuss what the main driver or drivers of that are?", "Heath Mitts", "Largely just, we would agree with you. But largely driven by the stronger order rates coming out of our fourth quarter where we see world. As we\u2019re looking at it we have pretty strong orders across all the businesses and across all regions. So it's a lot of going back to what Terrence has been talking about in the last few minutes around content and market share. We feel very, very good about it, but agree that it's not the normal seasonal step down that we would normally see. ", "Sujal Shah", "Okay, thank you Tim. It looks like there is no further anymore questions. So if you have any more questions please contact investor relations at TE.

Welcome to the TE Connectivity first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. ", "I'd now like turn to the conference over to Vice President, Investor Relations, Sujal Shah. Please go ahead.", "Sujal Shah ", "Good morning. And thank you for joining our conference call to discuss TE Connectivity's fourth quarter 2018 results.", "With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Terrence Curtin; Chief Financial Officer, Heath Mitts. During this call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information and we ask you to review the forward-looking cautionary statements included in today's press release.", "In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussion this morning and we ask you to review the sections of our press release, accompanying slide presentation that addresses use of these items.", "Press release and related tables, along with the slide presentation, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at te.com.", "Finally, for participants on the Q&A portion of today's call, I'll remind everyone to limit themselves to one follow-up question to make sure we can cover all questions during the allotted time.", "Now, let me turn the call over to Terrence for opening comments.", "Terrence Curtin", "Thank you, Sujal. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Before I get into our first quarter results and our guidance for the year, I want to spend a little time recapping the key messages from the Investor Day we held last month in New York. And I really want to thank those of you that joined us. ", "As you know, during that investor day, we laid out the strategic direction of TE, as well as our position as an industrial technology leader. ", "And in that sense, the key messages we highlighted during investor day, which are shown on slide three of the slide deck we posted this morning really were around, first, we built a portfolio with clear competitive advantages and we are positioned to deliver above-market growth.", "Secondly, the markets we serve have attractive secular trends and are benefitting from the content growth across all of our segments. ", "Thirdly, when we create value, it's through the work we do with our customers through strong differentiation, very much engineering intimacy through where we design with them in their architecture, and the scale and our leading global presence. ", "And lastly, we have a strong business model that has not only the growth levers about the three I just talked about, but also leverage to expand profitability, while when we use the cash from our attractive business model how we maintain an attractive return on capital.", "And when we talked about the strong business model, we also laid out targets for you. Targets where we believe the annual organic growth of our business model can be 4% to 6%. We can continue to drive annual margin expansion of 30 to 80 basis points per year as well as double-digit EPS growth.", "We also highlighted for you our M&A strategy, which indicated that we can add over 100 basis points per year, which adds to our organic growth through acquisition because of the breadth of the markets we play in.", "And as Heath and I, I think, are going to highlight over the next 20 minutes or so, what I'm very pleased about, not only with our strong results in the quarter and updated guidance for the fiscal year, I believe the performance you're seeing demonstrates the key messages that we laid out at investor day and strong execution by our teams that are consistent with the business model we laid out.", "So, if you could, let's please turn to slide four and let's get into the results for the quarter.", "We again delivered performance above guidance with double-digit growth in revenue and adjusted earnings per share. Sales, during the quarter, were $3.5 billion and this represented 14% reported growth and 8% organic growth year-over-year.", "In our Transportation segment, we grew 13% organically with double-digit growth across all three of our businesses.", "Industrial Solutions grew 6% organically, driven primarily by continued strength in our industrial equipment applications.", "And our Communications segment declined 6% organically year-over-year due to a decline in SubCom, but we did see 10% combined organic growth in our data and devices and appliances businesses in the quarter.", "And when I think about last year, we talked about performance across our portfolios, with operating margin expansion across all three segments.", "In our first quarter, we delivered record profitability with adjusted operating margins of 17.9%, driven by margin expansion in the Industrial segment, which was one of the key levers we laid out for you at investor day.", "Adjusted earnings per share grew a very strong 22% to $1.40, and this is a record on a quarterly basis for our company.", "Based upon this very strong start for the full year, we are raising our annual sales and adjusted earnings per share guidance. Our organic growth expectations, we are raising from 4% to 5% for the year, reflecting stronger first half momentum and the second half of the fiscal year that is in line with our prior view.", "We are raising our outlook for reported sales from 6% to 8%, reflecting 100 basis points of the organic growth increase and the remaining 100 basis points from the impact of currency exchange rates.", "On an adjusted EPS perspective, our expectations, we are raising $0.22 to $5.45 per share, and that represents 13% growth year-over-year, and I'll add more color towards the end of the call around our guidance.", "The other thing I want to highlight that we are excited to see is the continued strong momentum in our orders, with organic orders, we're up 22% year-over-year. Excluding SubCom, which had a very strong order quarter, orders were up 11% with growth across all regions.", "So, if you can please turn to slide five and let me get into orders in more detail and the trends that we're seeing across orders. We continue to see broad-based strength in orders across all three of our segments, which reinforces our growth outlook.", "Total orders, excluding SubCom exceeded $3.5 billion with a book to bill of 1.06. Orders were up 17% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 11% organically.", "We also continue to see broad-based strength globally. And once again, excluding SubCom, our orders organically grew 16% in Europe, 15% in the Americas and 3% in Asia.", "Turning to segment \u2013 orders by segment. In Transportation, orders increased 13% organically, with growth in all regions and strength especially in Europe, where we saw order growth of 17%. We also saw the year-over-year order growth in each of our three businesses in Transportation.", "Industrial orders grew 8% organically year-over-year, with growth across all regions and continued strength in our industrial equipment business.", "In Communications, excluding SubCom, we saw year-over-year organic growth of 7% in orders, with growth across all regions.", "And then, for SubCom, which we had carved out up till now, we had a very strong booking quarter. Year-to-date, we booked project orders of $400 million, and this has raised our total backlog above $1 billion in SubCom and reinforces the health of the current SubCom market cycle.", "So, if you could, let me turn from orders and start getting into our segment results. And as always, we'll start with Transportation.", "Transportation sales grew 13% organically year-over-year. Segment revenue exceeded expectations due to strong auto sales across regions. Growth across all submarkets and commercial transportation and 11% organic growth in sensors.", "Operating margins were 21%, and this was above our expectations and up 330 basis points sequentially and back to our normalized margin levels of 20% plus or minus midpoint.", "In auto specifically, our sales were up 10% organically, significantly above auto production trends that are in the low-single-digits. We are not only benefiting from content growth, but are also benefiting from our leading global position. We had growth in the teens in Europe as well as in the Americas and mid-single growth in Asia.", "We also continue to benefit from new program ramps, which contribute to our outperformance versus vehicle production levels.", "And also, as we highlighted during investor day, while the hybrid electric and EV market is still a small percentage of overall vehicle production, we continue to be extremely well-positioned with leading-edge solution and wins across all major OEMs across that technology.", "Turning to our commercial transportation business, we continue to outperform the market with organic revenue growth of 34% year-over-year, with balanced growth across all regions and growth within each submarket.", "While last year, we got the benefit of the trends we saw in heavy trucks, this year, we're seeing continued momentum in heavy truck, as well as we are experiencing growth in agriculture, mining and construction markets globally.", "In our sensors business, we grew 11% organically year-on-year with growth across all markets, including auto, commercial transportation and industrial end markets.", "As we highlighted for you on investor day, we continue to see strong design win momentum, particularly in auto applications where we've generated $1.2 billion of new design wins over the past two years across many different sensor applications as well as technologies.", "So, now, let me turn to the industrial segment, and if you can please turn to slide seven, we'll get into it by business.", "On an overall segment basis, sales grew 11% on a reported basis and 6% organically. Operating margins were 14% and expanded 270 basis points year-over-year, driven by strong operating leverage on higher volume.", "By business in the segment, in industrial equipment, organic order growth was 17%, with growth across all regions and strength in factory automation and medical applications.", "As we mentioned last month, we are focused on high-growth applications such as robotics and interventional medicine. Our strong position in high-growth markets coupled with the acquisitions in these areas are driving strong growth ahead of market.", "In our aerospace, defense and marine business, we saw slight organic decline of 2%, which was driven by commercial aerospace. While sales have been impacted by us by project timing over the past couple of quarters, we do expect this business to grow this year with the strong content wins that we highlighted to you during investor day.", "And in our energy business, it declined 6% organically, and this is really driven by the weakness in the overall European power market.", "So, if you can please turn to slide eight and let me cover Communications Solutions. The segment declined 6% organically due to the ramp up delays in the new SubCom program that I mentioned.", "This impact more than offset continued growth momentum in our data and devices and appliance businesses, which had a 10% combined organic growth in the quarter.", "In data and devices, we grew 2% organically, driven by strength in Asia and continued growth in high-speed connectivity and data center applications.", "As we highlighted to you during investor day, we shifted our portfolio to growing high-speed applications that have complex and technological challenges to meet the high-speed requirements.", "We continue also to benefit from our position with our hyperscale customers and we continue to drive margin growth through optimized operations in this business.", "In our appliance business, we had another strong quarter with 22% organic growth and double-digit growth in all regions as we continue to benefit from the trends in this area, including safety, efficiency and miniaturization.", "Over the past several quarters, our performance in appliances was given by share gains and product cycles in China. What was really nice about the first quarter and our guidance for the year is it's really been driven by our leading global position and we're seeing higher demands in the Americas and Europe contributing to the growth of our solutions. So, the growth is becoming much more balanced in appliances for this year.", "And then lastly, in SubCom, revenue and margins were impacted by the ramp up delay in the new program, which we have resolved. We do expect a couple of quarters of margin impact due to the project accounting nature of this business, but the SubCom market cycle remains very healthy. And these programs we just announced were with Google and Facebook and it brought our backlog to over $1 billion, as I previously mentioned.", "From a margin perspective, segment adjusted operating margins declined to 11.8% in the quarter, reflecting the SubCom ramp up delay. We expect this segment to run below our expected mid-teen operating margins for the next couple of quarters and then expand as we close the year.", "Now, let me turn it over to Heath who will cover the financials.", "Heath Mitts", "Thank you, Terrence. And good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide nine where I will provide more details on Q1 financials.", "Adjusted operating income was $623 million, with an adjusted operating margin of 17.9%, leveraging the strong organic growth of 8%.", "GAAP operating income was $581 million and included $35 million of restructuring charges and $7 million of acquisition charges.", "For the full year, I continue to expect restructuring charges of approximately $150 million, driven primarily by activity in our Industrial Solutions segment as we optimize the footprint and makes structural improvements across our TE cost structure.", "Adjusted EPS was $1.40, up a very strong 22% year-over-year, primarily driven by sales growth and operating margin improvement. For the quarter, our adjusted EPS performance was $0.15 above our prior guidance midpoint due to the strong revenue performance and operating income follow-through.", "GAAP EPS was a loss of $0.11 for the quarter and included a one-time tax-related charge of $1.42 of EPS, primarily due to the recently passed US tax legislation and restructuring and acquisition-related charges of $0.09.", "Because of the reduction in the US corporate tax rate, we recorded a charge to income tax expense of approximately $500 million to write-down our US deferred income tax assets.", "In Q1, our adjusted effective tax rate was 17.3%. As we said on our last call, we expect a full year tax rate in the 19% to 20% range and we now expect taxes to come in at the lower end of that range.", "For Q2, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 19%.", "Now, if you turn to slide ten please. As a reminder, the first quarter of 2017 was exceptionally strong, so we have some tough compares on a year-over-year basis. ", "However, if you look at our performance sequentially, we continue to demonstrate the consistent progress we're making as a company. Our strong Q1 results demonstrate that we're performing well against our business model and executing upon multiple levers to drive earnings growth, including organic growth, consistent capital deployment strategy of M&A and return of capital to our owners, and margin expansion through TE OA and cost reduction efforts.", "Adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 34%, down from prior year, but up 100 basis points sequentially. Adjusted operating margins were up 10 basis points year-over-year to 17.9%, a record for the company.", "Adjusted operating margins were up 160 basis points sequentially, with organic growth driving leverage in the operating structure of the company. Adjusted EBITDA margin in Q1 were 22.7%, down slightly from prior year, up 150 basis points sequentially.", "During our investor day last month, I discussed return on invested capital and our focus on balancing between growth and returns. We're targeting mid-teens adjusted ROIC through focused investing to support organic growth, while enabling long-term growth opportunities through acquisitions.", "Our business continues to generate solid free cash flow. In the quarter, cash from operations was $350 million and free cash flow was $127 million, in line with our expectations.", "We've returned $355 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the quarter. We also increased our investments in the business to capitalize on growth opportunities where we consistently demonstrate high returns.", "We've included a balance sheet and cash flow summary in the appendix for the additional details.", "With that, I will turn the call back over to Terrence.", "Terrence Curtin", "Thanks, Heath. And let me get into guidance. And let's start with the second quarter that is on slide 11 of your deck.", "So, for the second quarter, we expect revenue of $3.55 billion to $3.65 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.33 to $1.37. At the midpoint, this represents reported sales growth of 12%, organic sales growth of 6% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 13%.", "By segment, we expect Transportation Solutions to grow mid-teens on a reported basis, which includes the acquisition of Hirschmann, which is a leading provider of antenna technology and products, that we acquired late in fiscal 2017.", "On an organic basis, we expect high-single-digit growth in Transportation. We expect auto to be up high-single-digits in a global auto production environment we estimate to be up 2% year-over-year in the quarter, once again demonstrating outperformance due to content growth.", "We also expect, in Transportation, strong growth in commercial transportation and continued growth in sensors.", "In the Industrial Solutions segment, we expect growth of mid-single digits organically and that growth will be driven by the continued strength of industrial equipment and medical applications.", "And in Communication Solutions, we expect low-single-digit growth, driven by continued momentum in data and devices and appliances.", "Now, let's turn to slide 12 and I'll cover the full-year guidance for 2018. We expect full-year revenue of $14.1 billion to $14.3 billion. This is up $300 million from our prior guidance at midpoint and we expect adjusted earnings per share of $5.40 to $5.50, and this is a $0.22 increase versus our prior guidance.", "At the midpoint, this represents reported sales growth of 8% and organic sales growth of 5%. You should think about the $300 million increase in revenue guidance as $200 million due to organic growth increase in the first half of our fiscal year and the remaining increase due to currency translation.", "In bridging between our total growth and our organic growth between that 8% and that 5% of our new guidance, we expect acquisitions to add about 100 basis points and currency exchange effects to add the remainder about 200 basis points to the growth in 2018 above organic.", "Adjusted earnings per share growth is expected to be 13% at midpoint, driven by our growth in operating income expansion. While we have a positive impact from EPS, currency exchange effects of $0.11, this is offset entirely by the negative year-over-year impact of $0.12 from a higher adjusted tax rate when we compare to last year. So, really, the 13% is driven by operations.", "So, let me provide more color on our segments and our full-year guidance. We expect Transportation Solutions to be up in the low-teens on a reported basis and up high-single-digits organically, representing an improvement from our prior guidance.", "We expect our auto business to be up high-single-digits organically on 2% auto production growth, reflecting continued content growth and share gains.", "Commercial transportation is expected to continue to outperform its end market, benefiting from content expansion and share gains and we expect continued growth momentum in sensors.", "In Industrial Solutions, our guidance is essentially unchanged from our prior guidance from last quarter and is expected to grow mid-single digits on both a reported and organic basis, with the primary growth drivers being industrial equipment and medical applications.", "And in the Communications segment, we expect to be flat on both a reported and an organic basis, with our growth in data and devices and appliances being offset by the declines in SubCom that we highlighted to you already.", "In data and devices, we expect to benefit from high-speed ramps to cloud infrastructure customers as well as new design ramps for server OEMs. In appliances, we expect strong growth above market due to the share gains in all regions.", "And in SubCom, we expect revenue to be towards the lower end of our $800 million to $900 million range that we told you about last quarter.", "So, in summary, I continue to feel very good about our performance and execution, especially when I think about what we highlighted to you at investor day and it really came through during our results in the quarter as well as in this guidance.", "We have built a portfolio with clear competitive advantages and you're seeing the benefit of our leading positions and content growth driving growth above market as well as driving margin expansion.", "We continue to perform well against our business model as demonstrated by our strong quarter one results, which included 14% sales growth, record 17.9% operating margins and 22% EPS growth.", "And lastly, we are well-positioned in large markets with favorable secular trends and our guidance for 2018 indicates further growth above those markets and EPS expansion driven by the levers that we highlighted to you around expanding profitability.", "So, lastly, before we open it up for questions, I do want to thank our global teams for their strong performance in the quarter and ensuring that we bring our technology to our customers to further our leading positions around the world.", "So, now, let's open up for questions. So, Sujal, I'll hand it back over to you.", "Sujal Shah", "Thank you. Could you please give the instructions for the Q&A session?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And we'll go to Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital. Please go ahead.", "Amit Daryanani", "Perfect. Thanks a lot, guys. I guess two questions for me. Maybe to start off with \u2013 can you just talk about the Industrial segment. Operating margins were fairly strong over here in the quarter. Just trying to understand, if you're already starting to see some benefits from the cost optimization initiatives that you guys have laid out in the past or the improvement you are seeing are more organic and those benefits from cost takeout are more ahead of you? Because I think, historically, Q1 tends to be a trough for op margins in Industrial and then you see a nice steady ramp-up throughout the year. Just trying to get a sense of if that still transpires.", "Terrence Curtin", "Amit, thank you for the question. I would say this. The industrial team has been hyper focused on not just their organic growth opportunities, but also improving their market structure here. That didn't just start when we started talking about it a little bit more publicly during the investor day and some of our pre-calls. ", "However, I would tell you that the benefit that you saw in the quarter was largely around the leverage from that organic revenue growth. We have, as we've talked pretty extensively about, some significant footprint optimization, things that we're working on. ", "We'll see more of the benefit of that either later this year, but more pointedly into 2019 as that's a multiyear journey to get to those numbers. So, the 14%, we're proud of. And I think the teams have worked hard to get there. But did not receive a huge benefit from some of the footprint pieces that we've talked about that will be forthcoming. And we'll continue to keep you posted over the next several quarters and couple of years.", "Amit Daryanani", "That's really helpful. And if I can just follow-up. I guess, Terrence, for you maybe. I want to maybe better understand the back half expectations that you guys have right now for your fiscal year. You clearly have a very strong beat in Q1. Looks like there is some upside to Q2. But is it fair to \u2013 you're really not raising your back half expectations a whole lot right now. And if that's fair, I'm curious, what gives you the pause for back half or is it just being conservative to hopefully enable performance like Q1 sustaining throughout the year?", "Terrence Curtin", "As I said in my comments \u2013 thank you for the question, Amit. If you look at the guide, when we think about the year, certainly, we had a strong first quarter. We are teed up for a strong second quarter. And we did leave our back half unchanged.", "I think when you look at the markets, and let's start with the markets, first of all, we see an auto environment that we think production has gotten a little stronger than we guided last quarter. Last quarter, we talked about 1% production growth through the year. We view the year is going to be more 2%. But we do think that production growth is first half loaded and is mainly around Asia and Europe. North America has not changed.", "The industry markets are sort of as we saw them, so we didn't really change our guidance on the year. And then communications, what's really nice in communications, the growth that we had, I think communications, while the year is going to be flat, is really driven by appliances and D&D. We thought SubCom would cycle down and cycling down a little bit more due to this ramp program.", "So, the second half is unchanged. It's really our view of the markets. And we updated you for what we believe we see in front of us and we'll continue to update you as we go forward. But I think it is fair to say, it's the same guidance we gave you three months ago on the second half.", "Amit Daryanani", "Fair enough. Thanks. And congrats on the quarter, guys.", "Terrence Curtin", "Thank you.", "Sujal Shah", "Thank you, Amit. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "We'll go to Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Wamsi Mohan", "Yes, thank you. Terrence, great to see the overall results and Transport margins have come back so strongly. Your Transport segment is really decoupling pretty strongly from global production. You know they had a few things, content, market position and new wins. I was wondering, can you give us some sense on how much of this growth is coming from new wins? And regionally, where do you expect the biggest outperformance relative to production over the next few quarters? And I have a follow-up for Heath.", "Terrence Curtin", "Well, thank you for the question. And let me take the second half of your question first, Wamsi, and it's one of the things that I think \u2013 our auto position, we've always talked about how proud we are of that position and what we've accomplished there.", "But I do believe, when you think about our global position, you're really seeing it this year. So, last year, when we talked \u2013 we grew double digits on a 3% production environment. And a lot of that growth last year was we had a very strong China cycle. We had a nice European production environment. And North America was flat.", "When you look at this year, North America is going to continue to be flat. Production is going to be down a little bit. And like I said in my guidance, it's going to be high-single-digits. So, you're still seeing that content. And that content is broad-based of all the things that we talked about during investor day to you, whether that be electric vehicle, whether that be the connected car. And also, just the core qualification of the car as well. We can't lose sight of that; how electronics just in other applications, like safety, play a big part. ", "When you look at this year, though, geographically, Europe is going to have the strongest production growth this year. So, it is going to be probably the largest driver from a rate perspective of production growth, followed by Asia. North America, flat.", "And with our very strong European position and our engagements we have with our customers, we're going to continue to be talking about Europe, I think, for the rest of the year, which it's going to be a little bit different than last year where we talked a lot about China and Asia.", "And so, this proves our great global position. And the content growth is global. I mentioned in my comments, we grew double-digit in North America and a flat environment. We feel pretty comfortable we can grow mid-single digit in North America. And that market has been flat for multiple years now. And it just shows what we're bringing to our customers.", "Wamsi Mohan", "Thanks, Terrence. Thanks for the color. Heath, can you comment on how you're thinking about potentially any changes to capital allocation in light of the tax changes? And do you anticipate making any changes operationally in terms of site relocations, et cetera, in view of these changes? Thanks.", "Heath Mitts", "It's, obviously, a timely question, Wamsi. I appreciate it. The change in the US tax regulations that went into effect first part of this year, signed into legislation late calendar 2017, don't have a tremendous impact in terms of how we think about capital allocation. ", "At the end, a Swiss-based company, we don't have a repatriation issue in terms of where our cash is located. And the most important thing is, although some of the changes in the tax regulations, both here as well as some of the things that are going on in other parts of the world, probably put a little bit of pressure on our tax rate, our effective tax rate, over the next couple of, three or four years. I could see us moving up 100, 200 basis points, maybe to that 21%, 22% range, if you look out over the next three or four years.", "The most important thing to go back to, though, on that is our cash tax rate, which is the true economics, is still in the mid to high-teens. And that doesn't get dramatically impacted by the change in the policy.", "So, as we think about payback and returns and return on invested capital in terms of operational decisions and capital allocation, it doesn't have a tremendous impact on us. And, obviously, we'll plan around this. And while the US is an important piece, North America is only a third of our business. We have two-thirds of our business outside the US and we need to pay attention to those things as well.", "Wamsi Mohan", "Thanks, Heath.", "Sujal Shah", "Okay, thank you, Wamsi. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "We'll go to Joe Giordano with Cowen. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Giordano", "Hey, guys. How are you doing?", "Terrence Curtin", "Hey, Joe.", "Joseph Giordano", "Just a question on \u2013 kind of a specific question, I guess, on EV. And there's been talk from some of the sensor guys about trying to adapt like a lot more wireless sensing into some of the bigger applications on the electric powertrain. And there is debate whether or not that's the right choice of technology or not, but just curious as to how \u2013 what are you seeing in that kind of market? Is that something you're trying to even look at on your own sensor portfolio? But more like, what does that mean for connectors in EV powertrains if something like that is to kind of move forward?", "Terrence Curtin", "It's a great question. And it's just one of those things, when you look at electric vehicles, everybody is looking because it is so new. It is only about 4 million units when you take EV and plug-in hybrids. It's still a small part of the market. And you're seeing a lot of experimentation around what's the best way not only to get connection and power, but also in the most affordable way into the system.", "So, I think when you look at things like you talked about, there's lots of things that are happening around EV architecture [indiscernible]. What is great for us, we wouldn't only play in that, but as I think those of you that joined us on investor day, the breadth of our portfolio isn't just about one thing. It's about many things. It's about the inlets. It's about what happens around the battery as well as the sensors around it.", "So, when you look at something like that, that's both an opportunity for us, as well as things that may influence our product [indiscernible]. But when we think about content per vehicle in an EV, because of the breadth not just in sensors, but what we do as we shared with you, we have some programs that are up to $500 a vehicle. 2x content. And what's great is we're exposed to those trends and our product breadth is so broad, we're going to benefit whether it's a wireless or a connected solution.", "Joseph Giordano", "Sorry, I just jumped on late with a couple of companies here today. But relative to data and devices, I feel like every day I come in and you're seeing articles about who is spending more on data centers this year and it seems like a universally good story. And I was just curious of how your discussions, particularly with some of the hyperscale guys, when you talk about, like Facebook and what they're planning on doing. Are you starting to see initial indications of a real acceleration in that market?", "Terrence Curtin", "I would say twofold. We get benefits from two areas from those trends. You heard us highlight the wins we have in SubCom, which clearly are the high-speed backbone to really make those data centers work from that data traffic, and especially with video. We are seeing that in our \u2013 certainly in our SubCom order book that we highlighted.", "The other thing I would say, no different than last year, the amount of growth momentum we have around the cloud in our D&D business is almost entirely our growth driver in our data and devices business.", "So, while we'll talk about growth rate that might be low-single-digits, that cloud activity [indiscernible]. Where there is some slower activity in sort of telco spending and things like that and wireless is still sort of slow, but net-net, the cloud activity we have in our data and device businesses drove the growth last year that you saw, off repositioning of the portfolio. And it's also the primary driver of growth today in the business when we look at the guidance we gave you for the year and some of our excitement about it is all around the cloud and the hyperscale engagements we have.", "Joseph Giordano", "How big is that part of your D&D right now?", "Terrence Curtin", "From a rate perspective, it's about 30%.", "Joseph Giordano", "Okay, great.", "Terrence Curtin", "Of D&D revenue, roughly, Joe, off the top of our heads here.", "Joseph Giordano", "Thanks, guys.", "Terrence Curtin", "Thank you.", "Sujal Shah", "Thank you, Joe. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "We'll go to Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.", "Shawn Harrison", "Morning. And my congrats on the results as well. Two questions, if I may. The Transportation margins rebounded nicely in the quarter. Are there any lingering issues within that business in terms of getting lead times normalized or getting sub components in the door or anything like that that could affect the remainder of the fiscal year that you see at this point in time?", "Terrence Curtin", "Shawn, I think that's a fair question given how the last couple of quarters of our fiscal 2017 we were down in the 18 percentish range for transportation and we had talked some about some of the supply chain issues.", "Largely, those issues are behind us. The team has done a nice job working through even at these higher volumes some of those issues. And I think, as we guided, we would be up in to 19% range for that Transportation segment numbers and we certainly exceeded our own expectations and the team executed very well in the quarter.", "I would tell you, as you think about the remaining three quarters of the year, given the volume that we foresee and so forth, you should probably expect that to be more back at its normalized margins, around that 20 percentish range. ", "But you've got to know that, in a given quarter, a 90-day period, you could have a mix within a quarter that can swing it around a little bit too.", "But we're proud of the team working through a lot of the operational matters that kind of plagued us a little bit in the final part of 2017 and feel good about our position as we work our way through 2018.", "Shawn Harrison", "Got you. Good to hear. And as my follow-up, just thinking about the margin impact on SubCom and maybe what happens in a couple of quarters out, looks like, year-over-year, it maybe cost you 150, 200 basis points given the program delays.", "Do you get an outsized margin benefit because of program completion accounting, maybe, say, in the fourth fiscal quarter and does it just normalize out by whatever drag you saw this quarter, trying to think of how you maybe remodel it late 2018, early 2019 in terms of the benefit if the accounting works in your favor?", "Heath Mitts", "Listen, we don't have enough time on this call to take everyone to purchase price accounting \u2013 project accounting in terms of percentage of completion. And it has its own levels of complexity that we can certainly take offline.", "What I would tell you is that you should expect the next couple of quarters to look somewhat like this last quarter from a margin perspective, having that low double digits as the issue, albeit behind us operationally, does bleed over, the elements of the contract. ", "It won't surprise us, as we get towards the end of some of the things, as well as new contracts that kick in, that you would see a quarter that would be in the other side of that. That would be higher than what we would expect. Sometimes, Terrence will refer to the SubCom margins as EKG machine [ph] because they can move [ph] around relative to how the percentage of completion accounting works.", "Having said that, the true economics of the business are still quite solid. Cash flow coming out of the SubCom this year is quite good. We had a great Q1, had a cash flow for SubCom and we expect the remainder of the year. So, we could take some of the dynamics of the project accounting offline. But I would tell you that you could see some swings late this year or into the early part of next year, for sure.", "Shawn Harrison", "Very fair. Thanks, again. ", "Sujal Shah", "Okay, thank you, Shawn. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "And we'll go to David Leiker with Baird. Please go ahead.", "David Leiker", "Hi, good morning, everyone.", "Terrence Curtin", "Hi, David.", "Shawn Harrison", "So, if we take a look at the orders, the 11% increase in orders, 13% organically, 13% in Transportation, it seems like there are a couple of things at play here. Because of the portfolio and the global nature, you're getting more opportunities to bid on things. I'm guessing, your win rate is probably a little bit better and the programs are a bit larger. Are there any some examples that you can give us that help flesh that out a little bit?", "Terrence Curtin", "David, certainly. When you take our business, it's a lot of small projects. So, there isn't any one big program. I think when you look at, to some of your comment, we're seeing, like I think a lot of companies, you have synchronous global growth, which is benefiting the orders. But it's really our global position. I wouldn't say there was any big one order outside of SubCom [indiscernible].", "When you look at it, what's nice is, it's across all the trends and the bets we've been making on the portfolio, where to position this portfolio. So, the wins that we are seeing are along those applications that we laid out at investor day.", "So, whether they are auto, whether it is commercial transportation, what we're doing at sensors, all of them grew double-digit. It's not one big program. What we are doing around factory automation, we continue to see those trends. We also \u2013 medical continues the momentum that we had.", "And in appliances and data and devices, like Joe said, we're getting the benefit of the cloud. And we're also getting the benefit of miniaturization and efficiency in appliances. So, it is extremely broad-based. And you're seeing it in the orders. It's not one thing and it's not one market. It's really nice around the secular trends we talked about.", "Shawn Harrison", "What about as it relates to the win rate and the size of the opportunities that you are pursuing or winning?", "Terrence Curtin", "I wouldn't say the size of the opportunities are changing dramatically. I would say the take-up rates are a little bit heavier as we're seeing volumes stronger.", "So, the opportunities are similar to what we framed out when we think it down. And we think about opportunities as content per application. But we're seeing some of the volumes, the underlying volumes being stronger and strong positions we want. ", "And even if we want a program in the first quarter, it won't be MI [ph] orders. If I want an automotive program and isn't till the customers start placing orders, which could be two, three years out.", "So, when you look at the orders, they are programs that were won three, four, five years ago, not as current other than SubCom. SubCom is the only exception.", "Shawn Harrison", "All right, great. Heath, just one thing to follow up on on the taxes. Are there any high-level views \u2013 I know it's pretty complicated, but puts and takes on the taxes and your view of 2018 under the new rules versus the old law?", "Heath Mitts", "As I said in my prepared remarks, we had guided a tax rate \u2013 an effective tax rate of 19% to 20% here at the beginning of the year. I would say we are trending towards the bottom end of that. Some element of that would be attributable to some of the changes in the US policy and some of it is just jurisdictional mixes, where we have things coming in from. ", "So, not a tremendous impact. Versus other companies, we already start with a pretty low rate. And again, I continue to scare people back. We would expect our cash taxes for the year to be in the mid to high teens. So, pretty good numbers.", "Shawn Harrison", "Yeah. It seems like there's something there on the intercompany transactions that's at play here.", "Heath Mitts", "Certainly, that has an impact. As I discussed, we had about \u2013 there's multiple elements to it, but we had about $500 million write-down in our US deferred tax assets in the quarter. And that's a non-cash charge that we took and I think you'll see a lot of other companies discussing similar type of adjustments to their balance sheet.", "Largely, that had to do with write-downs to our assets on our balance sheet for the new tax rate relative to both our carryforward net operating losses as well as our carryforward, what they call, 163(j), which is some of the intercompany or just general debt interest rate deductibility. And that's part of that $500 million that we wrote down.", "Shawn Harrison", "Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.", "Heath Mitts", "Thanks, David.", "Terrence Curtin", "All right. Thanks, David. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "We'll go to Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Craig Hettenbach", "Yes, thanks. Terrence, just wanted to follow up your comments on EVs, and appreciate the context. It's still a small unit market today. At the same time, you're seeing just a swell of investment from OEMs committing capital to that market. So, just trying to gauge from you, as you look out over the next one, two, three years, how you are seeing that play out in terms of kind of a linear progression or potential step function up in EVs.", "Terrence Curtin", "What we get excited about is where we're positioned. When we sit there and we talked to many of you about, our view on EV plug and hybrid, hybrid, we sort of put a lot of those together. We sort of view that's about 4 million units today. About over the next five years, you're going to get up to about 16 million units.", "I don't think that will be linear. You get into how do governments support it, what social adoption and things like that. But, clearly, when you take what's happened with diesel, EV has come much more to the forefront. You see it with all our global OEM customers that really the two things that they're all focused on is both the autonomous trends and the electric vehicle trends.", "And what's great is both those trends impact us and we're positioned to capitalize on them. So, I feel very good about the momentum we have, the wins we shared with you.", "And when you sit there, while it's still a small part of our business, when we talk about the content going from $62 up to well over $80, that's going to be a big trend that drives that and that's part of the growth momentum we've talked to you about and we're investing.", "Heath talked about the investments that we're making around growth. Certainly, see it in the capital. It's really to make sure we capitalize on the EV trends globally, not with one customer, not in one region and we're really well positioned and it's still small today, but it's going to be a big growth driver as we go forward.", "Craig Hettenbach", "Got it. And just as my follow-up, maybe taking the other side on the order strength and understanding the global growth and the backdrop support that. At this point in the cycle, there's also rumblings of just things are tight and some lead times could extend. So, just your sense from a customer inventory perspective and distribution inventory and how you're seeing customers behave relative to other cycles.", "Terrence Curtin", "Craig, it's a great question. When you look at clearly having global synchronous growth, that creates tightness in itself. And I do think some of our businesses, whether it be things like commercial transportation, you see the growth rate we have there as the ag and the construction are strengthening. I think you see a little bit of it in our industrial equipment business as well as in our appliance businesses as you're getting it. We're getting some of the benefit as supply chains are catching up. So, that's where we see it. It would be more around those markets. And we do expect in our guidance, some of those markets will moderate as we get into the second half of the year with a view of some of that tightness will work out. But across the portfolio, when you look at the growth rates, our growth is very broad. And I think you can see where the areas that there are some places that it does feel hot. That could moderate as we get into the second half. When we look at our channel partners, our channel partners inventory have been staying pretty stable. And their sell-out and our sell-in, their point of sale and our point of purchase pretty much in line. So, it's been nice to see that that inventory in the channel is not going up. It's staying pretty much in line point of sale out and point of purchase in. and that's something we look at at a sort of pretty stable there in balance. We don't see it getting ahead of itself.", "Craig Hettenbach", "Got it. Appreciate the color.", "Terrence Curtin", "Thank you, Craig.", "Sujal Shah", "Thank you, Craig. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "We'll go to Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Deepa Raghavan", "Hi. This is Deepa Raghavan, Wells Fargo Securities.", "Terrence Curtin", "Hi, Deepa.", "Deepa Raghavan", "Hi. How are you? Pretty strong automotive trends. This \u2013 looks like, especially, you're benefitting from trend acceleration across the board. Could you talk about, if some of the trends, example, auto safety or EVs or fully autonomous applications that the OEMs seem to be adopting much faster than expected, will any of these trends benefit you more than the others or is the content kind of similar across these new trends?", "Terrence Curtin", "Number one, I do believe, as we highlighted at investor day, both those trends will impact us. Autonomous, when you think about autonomous and TE, you think about high speed. It's really the high-speed that we always talk about that you need with connectivity, getting into the car. And that's why we did Hirschmann. So, that we view is going to be something very important to us, as well as just what Craig asked on EV.", "When you get around the power dynamic that need to happen, how do you make power move in a car, going from a 12 volt to a full EV vehicle. Really plays into what we do. ", "So, when we look at the content, historically, we probably would have told you, before price, content, we grow 4% for us above underlying production. We basically, as Steve highlighted on investor day, we sort of view that's moved up to more like a 6% due to those key trends.", "So, I think the way that we're positioned, and also our global position, not just the technology we bring to our customers, I think we're very unique that how we cover the world and our leading position is equal globally, we will get the benefit no matter where the trends stay. ", "Deepa Raghavan", "Got it. Sensors, pretty strong, among others, obviously. Are some of these new automotive or commercial truck wins coming in slightly earlier than you would have expected?", "Terrence Curtin", "No, they are not. When you think of automotive or commercial truck programs, when you win those programs, especially in automotive, because [indiscernible] didn't really have an automotive position, they come in with the program launches. So, it isn't like automotive OEMs are moving up their launches. They are very methodical about program launches and how they make sure the vehicle quality is out there. So, when you look at the growth we had, it's in line with the timing we saw.", "Deepa Raghavan", "Okay. My final question, Communications segment. Would your data and devices division benefit from 5G or FirstNet rollout? If they do, would you talk about timing benefit? It looks like it would be more towards 2019 driven, but curious. Thank you very much.", "Terrence Curtin", "So, on 5G, if you take the past couple of years, Deepa, we have been talking a lot about data center and cloud. In the wireless, the next big step function in there is 5G. I do believe your timing is right on there. We like our position with 5G. Just the market trend hasn't kicked in yet to benefit us, for us to talk about. But, clearly, it's a trend that will benefit us starting in 2019 and beyond to our D&D business.", "All right. Thank you for the questions.", "Sujal Shah", "Thank you, Deepa. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "And we'll go to Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Please go ahead.", "Matt Sheerin", "Thanks. Good morning. Terrence, you were talking about growth in the commercial transportation and seeing some upcoming catalysts, including agriculture and other markets. You're looking at five or six quarters of double-digit growth year-over-year here. What is your sense of the cycle here and on production side of the equation? And are you seeing, just as you are in automotive, just a multi-year content growth story within that sector?", "Terrence Curtin", "So, first off, yes. The content growth story, the same content trends we have gotten in automotive because of our strong position, we're able to take them over to Industrial Transportation.", "And the other thing that's very nice about our industrial transportation business, it's pretty globally balanced as well. So, last year, when we spoke, we spoke a lot about China and what we were able to do around the China heavy truck cycle. Certainly, they had some regulation changes around the loading of trucks and we had the benefit of a strong heavy truck market in China as well as the content.", "As we came into this year, we thought the heavy truck market would slow down in China. It is, as we thought. But what's been really nice is some of the other areas that were not contributing as strong \u2013 the construction, the agriculture \u2013 is starting to kick in, which is also driving both market trend and content growth wins that we've had that's creating this really strong cycle.", "So, we feel good that \u2013 it's better than we thought it was going to be due to some of these other markets kicking in \u2013 ag and construction specifically. It just shows the strength of our global position and the trends we've tried to offer around where we add content with our customers.", "And it's been good to see and our team has done a tremendous job not only getting the content win, also make sure they are satisfying customers. Having 30% growth in a business and delivering to a more global customer base, that's quite a feat.", "Matt Sheerin", "That's helpful. And is that sensor growth that you're seeing also sort of dovetailing off of the commercial side of things, but you're saying, no, there's a decent exposure to that market in the sensor side?", "Terrence Curtin", "Yeah, we did. Actually, as I said, we had double-digit growth in the commercial transportation piece of our sensor business in the quarter. So, we had auto, commercial transportation as well as the industrial end markets, all three had double-digit growth in sensors. So, we're actually seeing the benefit of that as well.", "Matt Sheerin", "Okay, thanks a lot.", "Sujal Shah", "Okay. Thank you, Matt. Can we have the next question please", "Operator", "We'll go to Steven Fox with Cross Research. Please go ahead.", "Steven Fox", "Hi, good morning. One question and one confirmation. Just to clarify on the sensor business, you're still looking at sort of a second off book of business that starts to ramp maybe more so than you've seen like in the last year or so, is that correct?", "Heath Mitts", "In automotive, that sounds \u2013 so, the automotive programs will get stronger through the year. When you look at the fourth quarter versus where they are, the double-digit we had in the first quarter was slow, but that's in the automotive piece of sensors, Steven.", "Steven Fox", "Okay. And then, my question is, on the industrial side, you've got about a $2 billion rough number revenue business in the industrial and the organic growth is up 17%. I was wondering if you can sort of decompose that and how much you would attribute to maybe just better trends in the cycle versus content? Any more color on that would be really helpful? Thanks.", "Terrence Curtin", "When you sit there, there's a couple of things. You have both medical in there and industrial in there. So, when you look at those two \u2013 and both of them, really, what we're seeing in factory automation as well as medical continues.", "Certainly, in the industrial piece of it, it is around the factory automation element. And it is similar to some of the comments I made around automotive. It is global.", "We're seeing strength in Europe. We're seeing strength in the Americas. And certainly, continuing in China around factory automation.", "So, I would say, we're seeing the benefit of global strength that has lifted that up. There is content gain in there as well, Steve. That is also a big driver, which is important.", "The piece that we're just watching back to \u2013 a little bit of Craig's question, I do think there are some supply-chain elements that we would expect that business to moderate a little bit in the second half, just due to people trying to secure supply, but that's the one piece that I would say we need a little bit more wait and see on as we get too exciting there.", "Steven Fox", "Understood. Thanks for your help.", "Terrence Curtin", "Thanks.", "Sujal Shah", "Thank you, Steve. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "We'll go to Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Jim Suva", "Thanks. I have two pretty short questions, so I'll ask them at the same time. On the automotive content growth, and now at the higher-end of historical, given the long lead times in models and visibility you have, is it better to say that we're probably at a stage where it's at that high-end or even higher for the foreseeable future?", "And then, my follow-up question is, on the undersea telecom, we continue to see more and more contracts being awarded and deployed. Yet, you had challenges in that. Was that due to weather or not being able to get the components because it seems like a lot of the backlogs are taking longer than expected, and do you have visibility into that being right-sized about where it should be? Thank you.", "Terrence Curtin", "Let me take the second one. It's not weather. It was not \u2013 it had nothing to do with component. It's a new project ramp that took us a little bit longer to get out and manufacture it. It was within our shop. ", "So, when you sit there, it's a big complicated project with new technology. And it took us longer to get the system up and running. And that's impacted us.", "Like you said, the cycle is very strong. And when you look at the backlog that we booked and the orders year-to-date of $400 million, last year, we did $500 million for the year. We just did $400 million in the first full month of this year. So, the cycle is healthy.", "And I think it's similar to what we highlighted last month, is we like the cycle. It's elongated. Even some of the programs we want are out in 2021. They aren't programs that we could even start today.", "So, we do feel it's the cycle that Shad highlighted to you during investor day and this is just a new project ramp that we did resolve. We will get the benefit. But to Shawn's question, project accounting is not always the most intuitive. And it will have to work through over the life of the project. That will create a little lumpiness in the CS market.", "On your first question on content, it does come back to program launches. It does also come back into mix a little bit. I think we feel very good about that 6% content growth that Steve talked about.", "In some cases, it will be. Is there more EV adoption versus combustion engine adoption? I can't say we are at a new normal. What I can tell you is, we are very well-positioned against all those trends that are colliding in a positive way in the automotive space. And what I feel very good about, both last year and this year, we're proving to you consistently of our content story versus a production environment that, last year, was 3%. This year, it is 2%. And we're consistently outgrowing it.", "And it is due to that content position, that's how we bring value to customers. So, I can tell you, we feel very good on what we told you last month. And I don't think one quarter changes it.", "Jim Suva", "Thank you so much for the details.", "Terrence Curtin", "Thanks, Jim.", "Sujal Shah", "Thanks, Jim. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "We'll go to William Stein with SunTrust. Please go ahead.", "William Stein", "Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a very strong results and outlook. The one question I have relates to your more robust view on auto production for the year. As we all know, China is becoming a more important factor in that forecast. And there were some tax incentives that were in place. And I think half of it rolled off about a year ago or thereabouts. And maybe more of it rolling off now. Can you bring us up to date as to what's happening with the incentives in China and how that is affecting your business and maybe whether it's been a surprise or not? Thank you.", "Heath Mitts ", "Actually, the incentives, we spent a lot of time last year talking about the incentives where the incentives probably hung on a little bit longer last year. But the incentives are over in China. And what's really great, like I laid out earlier, it's a global position.", "The only thing we've seen in China a little bit is we've actually seen the car OEMs get a little bit more aggressive in pricing than actually waiting for a government incentive, probably more traditional behavior that we would we see here in the Western world than what we've seen in China versus government incentive. ", "But the government incentives are over. And when we think about auto production globally this year, Asia, including China, with China as the biggest piece, we expect to be about 3% for the year. And we expect the globe to be 3% for the year. So, instead of China and Asia having an outperformance versus global auto production, we sort of view it to be an average.", "And our increase in the auto production from 1% to 2% was as much due to Europe as it was due to Asia. Both contributed and both of that pretty much in the first half of our year. So, production in the first quarter was a little stronger. We expected a little bit stronger due to Europe and Asia here in the second quarter. Second half auto production estimates by us are essentially unchanged.", "William Stein", "It's very helpful. Thank you.", "Sujal Shah", "All right. Thank you. Well, can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "And we'll go to Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Sherri Scribner", "Hi, thank you. I just have a big picture question about margins. If you look at the first quarter, very strong margin performance, helped by the automotive \u2013 the Transportation segment and the Industrial segments. But it seems like, if you look at the full year guidance, you're suggesting there some moderation. I think there was some commentary about that as well. So, somewhere in the middle of your 30 to 80 basis point improvement is where I think the full year numbers are coming out.", "I guess, my question is, is that right you're expecting some moderation in margins and we sort of had a better-than-expected margin performance this quarter versus where you're expecting going forward?", "And then, as part of that, do you think that maybe some of your second half assumptions for margins are conservative?", "Heath Mitts ", "Well, Sherri, this is Heath. I'll take the question. I would say that, certainly, we came out of the year on all cylinders from a margin perspective and we feel good about the performance. We would expect the margins in the Transportation segment to moderate, closer to the more normalized number, closer to 20 percentish, albeit we'll still show nice year-over-year margin expansion within that segment.", "Same with the Industrial side. I would say Industrial is probably a little rich in the quarter. But still, lot of positive trends there.", "Within Communication, as I indicated earlier, we would expect, because of some of the project accounting timing, with SubCom, it would still stay in the low-double-digits, maybe jus inside where we are today.", "So, conservatism in the second half of the year is for others to discern, not me. But I would say that we're taking a cautious feel and we feel good about the organic growth. We feel good about the orders. And there's nothing in our guidance assumption that assumes there's big cost inflow or major mix change that's different, but we're taking a normal and a fairly cautionary approach. And we'll update everybody every 90 days.", "Sherri Scribner", "Thanks.", "Sujal Shah", "All right. Thank you, Sherri. Can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "And we'll go to Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Mark Delaney", "Yes, good morning. Thanks for the opportunity to ask the question. And congratulations on the good quarter. I'll keep it to one question. On SG&A, I think the SG&A percent at 10.9%, just looking at my model, I think that's the lowest in about 10 years. So, very nice job on the SG&A line. How should we think about that item going forward? I think it was 12.1% in 2017. So, are these SG&A savings, is that something that's sustained or should we see an increase? Any sort of color on the ratio for fiscal 2018 would be helpful.", "Heath Mitts", "Sure. Mark, this is Heath. I think, again, similar to Sherri's question, we had some normal seasonality with that as well. So, I think that's a little bit low from a modeling perspective for fiscal 2018, that 10.9%. But, certainly, as we discussed at the investor day back in December, we do have a goal of moving our operating expenses, inclusive of SG&A, closer to 16%, while protecting our R&D and our raw engineering spend within that.", "So, you will see progress towards that. I would think that modeling it that low for the rest of the year is probably a little aggressive, though.", "Mark Delaney", "Thank you.", "Terrence Curtin", "Okay, thank you, Mark. It looks like we have no further questions. So, I would like to thank everybody for joining us on the call this morning. ", "If you've got any follow-up questions, please contact investor relations at TE. Thank you. And have a nice day.", "Heath Mitts", "Thank you, everybody.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
