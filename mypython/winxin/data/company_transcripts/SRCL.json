At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Stericycle's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.", "Sean McMillan, Vice President of Corporate Finance, you may begin your conference.", "Sean McMillan - Stericycle, Inc.", "Welcome to Stericycle's Fourth Quarter 2016 Conference Call \u2013 2017. I will now read the Safe Harbor Statement. This conference call may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, for example, general, economic and market conditions. Our actual results could differ significantly from the results described in the forward-looking statements.", "Factors that could cause such differences include changes in governmental regulation of the collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of regulated waste or the proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information; increases in transportation and other operating costs; the level of governmental enforcement of regulations governing regulated waste, collection and treatment or the proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information; our obligation to service our substantial indebtedness and to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our private placement notes, term loan credit facility and revolving credit facility; our ability to execute our acquisition strategy and to integrate acquired businesses; competition and demand for services in the regulated waste and secure information destruction industries; political, economic and currency risks related to our foreign operations; impairments of goodwill or other indefinite life intangibles; variability in the demand for services we provide on a project or nonrecurring basis; exposure to environmental liabilities; fluctuations in the price we receive for the sale of paper; the outcome of pending or future litigation; disruptions in or attacks on our information technology systems; compliance with existing and future legal and regulatory requirements; as well as other factors described in our filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K.", "As a result, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results or trends. We make no commitment to disclose any subsequent revisions to forward-looking statements.", "I'll now turn it over to Charlie Alutto, CEO.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thank you, Sean. Hello, everybody. Thank you for joining us on today's call. Overall, we're very pleased with our first quarter performance. Highlights for the quarter included a great start to the year from our Secure Information Destruction Services. Another strong quarter from our Communication and Related Service business, and our Regulated Waste and Compliance Services came in as expected. Joining me on today's call to discuss these highlights and other items from the quarter will be Dan Ginnetti, CFO; and Brent Arnold, COO.", "I will now turn it over to Dan.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thanks, Charlie. The results for the first quarter are as follows. Global revenues were $892.4 million, up 2.1% from $874.2 million in Q1 2016. And internal growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions, divestitures and manufacturing and industrial service, was 3.6%. Domestic and Canada revenues were $710.8 million. Internal growth, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange, was 2.2%.", "International revenues were $181.6 million. Internal growth, when adjusted for foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures was 1.8%. As anticipated, internal growth rates were impacted by the exiting of certain patient transportation contracts and manufacturing and industrial services. Acquisitions contributed $10 million to growth in the quarter and divestitures reduced revenues by $0.7 million. Gross profit was $368.7 million, or 41.3% of revenues. Gross profit was reduced by approximately 40 basis points in the quarter due to a reclassification of certain expenses from SG&A to cost of revenues. This reclassification impacts historic and future reporting.", "SG&A, excluding amortization, was $198.3 million, or 22.2% of revenues. Adjusted income from operations, or EBITA, was $170.4 million, or 19.1% of revenues. Net interest expense was $23.3 million. The as-reported tax rate for the quarter was 34.7%. Net income, attributable to Stericycle was $53.4 million, or $0.62 per share on an as-reported basis and $1.09 when adjusted for acquisition-related expenses and other adjustments.", "Now for the balance sheet. Our covenant debt to EBITDA ratio was 3.38 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of the revolver was approximately $715 million. In the quarter, we repurchased 145,700 shares of the mandatory preferred convertible on the open market in the amount of $9.6 million. At the end of the quarter, we have authorization to purchase 2.9 million shares.", "Our CapEx was $33.1 million, or 3.7% of revenues. Our DSO was 62 days. Year-to-date, as reported cash from operations was $175.3 million and when adjusted for recall reimbursements and other items, cash from operations was $197.7 million. I will now turn it over to Brent.", "Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thanks, Dan. This quarter, we closed 13 tuck-in acquisitions. The 13 acquisitions include nine in the US and Canada and four international. Revenues in the quarter were approximately $2 million and annualized are approximately $13.7 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust, with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business. In the quarter, we saw strong sales and operational performance from our Secure Information Destruction team, another solid quarter from our Communication and Related Services team, and good progress on our SQ strategic investments. Our Secure Information Destruction revenue was strong for both ongoing and one-time services. This sales activity combined with higher recycling revenue generated organic growth of 8%. The success factors contributing to our sales performance include: the investments we made in our sales team, the impact of our cross-selling initiatives and the team's ability to convert the unvended market.", "We are pleased with the progress the team has made in the past year. The integration of our Shred-It and subsequent tuck-in acquisitions remain on track. The investments we made in call center automation, intelligent work distribution systems and standardized best practices across our branches are making us more efficient and improving our overall service.", "The Communication and Related Services team also delivered a very strong first quarter. Our market-leading position and unique capabilities have enabled us to serve new brands across many industries. For the first time as a combined business, we leveraged our call center agents and operational infrastructure to meet the needs of several large recall customers.", "Within the SQ business, we continue to invest in our data analytic capabilities and to pinpoint areas of opportunities and improve our performance. We remain excited about these new tools and how they will help us drive future growth and reduce the impact of pricing pressures.", "In closing, I would like to thank all of our worldwide team members for their continued commitment to our customers, our shareholders, and our core values. I will now turn it over to Charlie.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thanks, Brent. I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2017. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration and acquisition related expenses, and other adjusted items. For 2017, we believe EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.55 to $4.75, using a share count of approximately 91 million. This includes the impact from foreign exchange and acquisitions. We believe revenues for 2017 will be in the range of $3.53 billion to $3.66 billion depending on assumptions of foreign exchange and internal growth rates.", "The worldwide revenue guidance for each of our service lines is: Regulated Waste and Compliance Services will be in a range of $2.01 billion to $2.06 billion. Secure Information Destruction Services will be in a range of $795 million to $825 million. Communication and Related Services will be in a range of $345 million to $375 million, depending on recall revenues. Manufacturing and Industrial Services will be in a range of $375 million to $395 million. This includes the full year impact of the UK divested M&I asset. We have estimates for adjusted free cash flow in 2017 of between $450 million to $470 million. 2017 CapEx is anticipated to be between $125 million to $150 million. We expect the 2017 full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 36.5%. We are very pleased with the start of 2017 and we are confident in the long-term outlook for our business.", "Thank you for your time today. We'll now answer any questions. Please keep in mind that we have many analysts who follow Stericycle. We ask that you limit yourself to a couple of questions. Kelly, you can now open the Q&A line.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Certainly. Our first question comes from Sean Dodge from Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC", "Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe starting with the SQ pricing, you guys had built $40 million of pressure into 2017. What was the experience during the first quarter and maybe can you talk about how comfortable you still are with a $40 million target for the year?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yes, thanks, Sean. With respect to Q1, Q1 SQ pricing pressure came in generally as we expected. So there is no change to the assumptions for SQ pricing pressure that we discussed at our investment day this past November.", "Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. And then the M&I guidance, it looks like you took that up for the full year despite what kind of looked like a tough start to the year. Can you talk about what happened there and maybe your level of comfort that we'll see an acceleration as the quarters roll on?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yes. Actually, Sean, the M&I revenue guidance for the full year is unchanged. It's still $375 million to $395 million. As far as the M&I growth rates in Q1, it generally came in as expected. The results were negatively impacted by an unfavorable Q1 2016 comp, FX, UK divestiture, but with respect to our guidance, it's unchanged. So we think it will come in line for the remainder of the year.", "Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC", "Got it. Thanks, again.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thanks, Sean.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ryan Daniels from William Blair. Please go ahead.", "Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Yes, thanks for the time, gents. I wanted to start with a question on some the investments you're making in core regulated medical waste on the sales and marketing front. It sounded like in your prepared comments you're already seeing some benefits there. So you can you maybe go through a little bit what you're seeing and what specific areas have driven the most return on investment for the organization?", "Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc.", "Hey, Ryan, this is Brent. I'll take that one. Let's start with the data analytics piece because that's where we've made a lot of good progress. So far the team has put the tools in place. We've hired some key folks with the technical expertise to help us kind of pull all this together. We are currently using big data and predictive analytics to guide our efforts in a number of areas. I would say one is our lead loads for our sales teams. Another is creating more effective sales offers for our customers. Both of those initiatives, we are seeing improve sales effectiveness for our team. So those are early payoffs that we are recognizing from these investments. We are also trying to recognize when customers may be at risk and putting together different offers that are catered specifically for those customers. So again, those are the ways we are using big data. From a marketing perspective, as we mentioned a couple of quarters ago, we've added an outbound sales team as well as face-to-face sales reps. We've cross trained some sales reps from Shred-It and the field organization to sell both our RMW and Shred-It and we have had some really nice wins, some large wins from those folks as well. So overall I would say the investments are on track. It's early innings but we are pleased with how they started.", "Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay, that's helpful. And then as my follow-up, the strength you saw in document destruction, can you talk a little bit more about what we should be considering for an organic growth rate going forward? I guess, meaning how much of this is kind of one time purge-related activity that benefited the quarter versus the true recurring sales? Thanks.", "Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc.", "Sure. Overall, we are really pleased with our 8% organic growth. About half of that growth is driven by really solid performance by the team. So that's a combination of our field sales executives that are closing the unvended customers, or customers that currently don't to do service with any provider. The investments we've made in our inside sales team produce really solid one time or purge revenue as well as our national and regional accounts they're having a great deal of success. So all of that related to our overall organic performance. The other part of that was driven by increases in recycling. So overall, I would say our growth goals organically net-of-paper is anywhere from about 3% to 5% and we are well within that range.", "Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thanks, Ryan.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman from Stifel. Please go ahead.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. Could I just make sure I understood what you asked there and not use up a question? So 4% of the growth is the year-over-year difference in paper in total, right? As opposed to versus your guidance? Because your guidance has $155 million in there and paper was like $175 million. So I just want understand the delta there. How much was more than your guidance versus...", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yes, so Michael, if you look at it this way, obviously when we did guidance at the beginning of \u2013 at the end of last year, we used $147 million to $167 million. So it's slightly higher today, so you wouldn't attribute all 4% to the high price today, where we ended the quarter I think at $175 million. I'd say 1%, 1% to 2% is probably because of the higher paper prices, because right now we are slightly outside of our upper-end of the range when we gave guidance at the beginning of the year.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then can we talk about the margins and, sort of, thinking about what's going on in margin overall and the puts and takes in it? So I don't think anybody should be alarmed if your margins are down, given some of the issues, but can we talk about why they're down? What's the contributions? Like how much of it is M&I having a tough comp. It was profitable a year ago and maybe it's not this year? The pricing issue versus offsets like, I'm assuming you closed some call centers in the patient communication side, that helps margins there. And then like where is recalls and returns? Were those revenues down or were they up year-over-year? What are the puts and takes around the margins?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yes, Michael. There's a lot of questions in there on that and we'll talk about EBITDA margins specifically, because we could go on all of them. First of all, would like to just share that for the quarter to our guidance, we were slightly ahead of margins. I think our guidance was 19%, we came in at 19.1%. So we're very pleased it came within guidance. I think what you're looking at though when you're comparing margins is probably year-over-year and certainly you would have to factor in things that \u2013 we continue to see pricing pressure that didn't exist a year ago at this time. We guided down throughout the course of the year for M&I. Those would've been some the things that are pushing margins down. Further to that, Michael, you'll know in the Investor Day, we spoke specifically about making investments in the business, knowing full well that that would bring up our SG&A for future benefit to be able to make investments in sales resources in Brent's area or make investments in our accounting and shared services and systems in order to drive benefits in the future.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And if I were to think about how that's split, is it evenly between the operational ones versus the investment ones? Is it two thirds, one third? How do I think about the weight?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "I think I would split it, I think \u2013 are you talking between SG&A and gross margin? Or are you just talking in general over the...", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "So, I mean, if RMW and M&I are an operating reason why margins are down and then G&A is an investment reason. What's the split between those two categories, operating and the investment side, for the pressure? Is it split evenly? Is it 60/40?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. I would put it \u2013 without having the specific calculations on that, Michael, I think it's about split evenly. Some are the year-over-year comparatives. The other is the investments that we're making into future growth and stability in the shared service area.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "All right. So, last one. Following up on that last comment, where do you stand on making a decision about a standard \u2013 one single ERP picking the -- whatever it's going to be and then starting down the path of that investment?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. So, as we talked about in the past, one of the first steps we did is we brought in some new talent, a new CIO, who came in in September of last year. Really, his charter early on was to evaluate our systems, to do an analysis of our business and see what systems would fit in. From there, we're really in that design and evaluation phase. I think we will continue to explore that and then from there, we would make a decision on a go or no go and what system would be there. I think that's going to take really throughout the balance of the year for us to be able to fully and adequately analyze what single system would fit Stericycle's environment.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "So from our standpoint, modeling cost wise and/or capital spending related to that, that would be an 2018 event, then.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. At this point in time, no change to the guidance but that timeline is unknown. If there were any changes in the latter half of the year, we certainly would communicate it at that point. But this is not a simple solution. This is one that would take multiple years to implement at Stericycle.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then, what was the recall revenue in the quarter?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. The recall revenue in the quarter, Michael, when we give the Communication and Related Services now, the global recall number we use there is $125 million to $150 million globally. We came in slightly better from a global standpoint than Q1 of 2016. I don't have the number because we don't break it out anymore, but with respect to global recalls, we're still in that range for the year, about $125 million to $150 million.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Okay. Thanks.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Great. Thanks, Michael.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thanks, Michael.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Oh, thanks. Good afternoon. Could you all provide an update with regard to some of the issues you've had down in Latin America with regard to International business? Just a progress report there, please.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. From an international perspective, more specifically, with Latin America, we did see price pressure come in as expected, Scott, in Q1. We are starting to exit some contracts where we just can't make the margin that we expect in that business. So part of the bridge to the previous guidance on revenue and the new guidance, we did take down some revenue with respect to Latin America, but from a pricing pressure, it came in as expected. Overall though, I'm happy to report that from a margin perspective year over year, we had a slight improvement in EBITDA margins and we continue to focus on integration, route density and introducing additional services to help drive growth and profit in the International business.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Thanks. Yeah. And International was a little bit stronger than I would have anticipated. Could you, I guess \u2013 I mean, you ticked off a few things. Anything else worth going into there? And I have a follow-up if you've covered it already.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "No. I think when you look at the headline number for International growth, it was at 2% approximately, but I think when you take out the negative impact, which is the patient transport contract exit and M&I, it comes into about a 5.4%. So I'd say that's normal. As you know, I mean, you've followed the company for a long time, that's about a normal growth rate. We continue to add additional service, like I said, shredding. In the international markets outside of Canada and the US, that falls into the international growth number and they're doing really well in the markets where we have secure information disruption. So that's one of the things that I think is driving some good growth in the international market.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. I think another thing that we talked about, especially on the Q4 call, was some of the challenges that we were having from a collection standpoint that had readjustment of some of the reserves we had down there. We just recently added an additional resource down there, a credit and collection manager responsible for all of Latin America to really drive discipline down there. Too early to have any results, but really, that's going to have our focus and, hopefully, be able to return to driving some cash flow inbound in that area as well.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Thanks. And just a quick follow-up because I heard four international acquisitions in the quarter. Could you just elaborate on those specifically, please?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Sure. They are \u2013 the four international were one, secure information destruction, and three, regulated waste. They were in two in the Netherlands, one in Spain and one in Portugal.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Thanks very much.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thanks, Scott.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kevin Steinke from Barrington Research. Please go ahead.", "Kevin Mark Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Good afternoon. So just wanted to clarify on the guidance for secure information destruction, it appears that did go up by $10 million. So what drove that? Was it acquisitions? Better organic growth? Paper prices? What were the factors driving that higher guidance?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yes, Kevin, it was mostly acquisitions and some favorability on FX going forward.", "Kevin Mark Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And then just the \u2013 it looks like total revenue guidance went up by $20 million. Can you just provide the bridge versus prior guidance on that?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yes, it went up to slightly less than that. We raised it about $12 million for the acquisitions and the 2017 effect of those. And then we had a combination in our international business of raising foreign exchange by about $14 million, offset by about $10 million reduction, largely due to what Charlie shared, which is exiting certain contracts in Latin America that just aren't meeting our profitability levels, and as well as exiting one more patient transportation contract.", "Kevin Mark Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "All right. Sounds good. Thanks for taking the questions.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thanks, Kevin.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hey, guys. Good afternoon. I guess the first question, in the US Medical Waste business, if we pull out hazardous from it, can you give us a sense. Is your customer count growing in that business? Has it been growing? Or has that been declining?", "Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc.", "Hey, Gary, this is Brent. I would say it's been modestly growing over the last several years.", "Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. And that hasn't really changed in the last year or so as the pricing pressure and all that's been going on?", "Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc.", "No, I think the pricing pressure obviously is having an effect on revenue and SQ as we're renewing contracts at discounted rates, but it's not reducing the number of new sites we're bringing on through inbound and outbound selling efforts.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yes, and part of the investment we talked about, Gary, was the investment in being proactive and more offensively going after new Med Waste contracts which really, most of our SG&A historically has been on upselling, so we are gaining share with respect to sites on SQ. And every year we pick up more sites, more volume, and more customers for our Med Waste operations in the US. That trend hasn't changed.", "Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. And have you seen a return on those investments? Or should we think that's more later this year into next year that you start to see that, the new sales efforts, et cetera, actually driving more clients?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yes, as we came out with when we made the investments, we really thought that it would take a while for those to get established and we would start to see returns in the latter half of 2017 and into 2018, and I would say that's still the case.", "Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "And then just any commentary or color on the second quarter outlook, what we should expect? If you provided any, I missed it.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yes, so I think some of the things that you might want to look at here is we've held to our guidance at least for the raise slightly for the year, EPS, I think. Q2 EPS range, I think it's appropriate to be at about $1.10 to $1.16. I think when you looked at the end-quarter EPS result, you saw that we got about a $0.03 benefit from tax. What's important to realize is that was expected, that was built into our tax rate for the year. It got pulled slightly forward to where we experienced the majority of it in Q1, so the caution there is to make sure that we don't just raise from there. I would take about $0.01 out of each of the future quarters that got pulled forward. So $1.10 to $1.16 is a good range to be in from an EPS standpoint going into Q2.", "Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "And then just one more, if I could. I've got a lot of questions about the legal liability from this class-action suit and I'm sure you can't comment on ongoing litigation, but if one were to look at the settlement you made a couple of years ago with what was, as I understand it, a much smaller segment of your customer base, is it reasonable to think that the liability to the current ongoing could be potentially significantly more than that one? Or is there just nothing you can say at this point? Thanks.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yes, I really can't say anything. I think it's \u2013 you can't draw any conclusions to past settlements to future settlements.", "Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. All right. Fair enough. Thanks, guys.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thanks, Gary.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joel Kaufman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Just any update on the competitive landscape and some of the national or larger regional accounts? I know at the analyst meeting the team felt fairly comfortable that these pockets were well protected from the pricing pressure or competitive pressure. Just wondering if you could provide a status update there?", "Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc.", "Hey, Joel, I'll take that one. This is Brent. I would tell you that from a national account perspective, there is always pricing pressure, right? Because a lot of our large national customers are in very competitive markets. But I would say that what we do really well is, given the fact that we have multiple services, whether it's in retail and the fact that we can provide medical waste for their on-site clinics or the hazardous retail waste or shredding, we really are able to offer a lot of our national accounts more than one service and have a very good reputation of doing so. So I would say, overall, it's a competitive industry. Renewals can be challenging sometimes, but we offset that with growth of new customers or additional services within existing customers.", "Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. Then just a follow-up on that front. I know we haven't focused much on the LQ side of the business, but I would assume that your larger customers are aware of some of the pricing dynamics that are happening on the SQ side of the business. Wondering if this has translated to any incremental pressure in the LQ segment? And maybe what steps you're taking internally to prevent any of those headwinds from manifesting?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yes, if anything, our LQ business is growing nicely. I mean, we have added additional services. We continue to add new reusable sharps to our Sharps Management Program. Our Pharmaceutical Waste, every quarter, we add new accounts and do new installs there. To Brent's point, we really differentiate the offering. We think we've got a great offering with our secure information destruction service, which virtually every LQ account in healthcare has a requirement for, and they're competitively priced. I mean, historically, they've had lower margins there and GPOs have a place in that process. So we haven't seen anything with respect to pricing pressure. To Brent's point, there's always pricing pressure on the LQ side of the business but that hasn't changed with any of the recent developments that we have seen on the SQ side.", "Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And just one more if I can slip it in. Fairly mild winter we had. Just wondering if there was any impact from weather that you could quantify?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "No, not from one of these (31:18) last two winters. I think there was a little bit more weather probably in Q1 of 2016 but even that was a mild winter. No, there's nothing to call out here with respect to weather and the US operations.", "Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc.", "I think you can see that, Joel, in a great performance if you looked at just net of tax, the EPS coming in at $1.06, slightly above the midpoint of the range. I think we are very pleased with the results of Q1.", "Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason Rodgers from Great Lakes Review. Please go ahead.", "Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review", "Yes, just wanted to see if you were reaffirming your targets for Shred-It as far as the $20 million in synergies for the year?", "Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yes, Jason, it's Brent. Based on the good activity with regard to rolling out standard work, based on the investments we have made in customer service and in inside sales. We are also having continued success at converting from on-site to off-site. Overall, the team has done a really nice job and we are on track to achieve the $20 million in savings in 2017.", "Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review", "And then as far as your debt levels, is there a target leverage ratio you have for the end of 2017?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "As we talked about, I mean, we've done a great job of generating cash. If you looked at Q1, it was an incredible cash quarter. Just to caution you for Q2, obviously we make two tax payments in Q2, so to temper your expectations just for Q2. But we are able to take that cash, continue to pay down debt. I think over the course of about a year we have paid about \u2013 close to $250 million of debt down. We still anticipate that through normal operations, that we can be approaching and maybe even slightly below three times debt to EBITDA by the end of the year.", "Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review", "And then finally, just wondered what would be a good number as far as interest expense to use for 2017? Thank you.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "For interest expense, our guidance has been in the range of $100 million to $104 million. That includes certain expectations for a couple of rate hikes within the year. So I think that's a good range to be.", "Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Larry Keusch from Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Thanks and good afternoon. Could you guys talk a little bit about where you're tracking to the targeted invested amount that you laid out in the guidance for 2017? Is that sort of progressing as you had anticipated through the first quarter?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah, I think what you're talking about is maybe our capital allocation strategy that we provided at the investor day. I think one of those was about $40 million of investments towards the mandatory preferred repo and I'd say we are on track with that. We got $0.05 in the quarter. Our goal was about $0.17, so $0.05 is exactly where we would expect us to be. So I think we're on track there. We had anywhere from, I think, $100 million to $110 million, roughly, or $120 million, for acquisitions. I think if you look at where we're are at now, we might be spending slightly below that, but still getting great tuck-in and acquisitions from a quantity standpoint. And the quality of those, we are very excited about those, so I think we are definitely going to be at or maybe below the range. We'll see how the rest of the year shakes out. And the rest of that is really going towards debt and the cash that we're generating, I'd say, that we're putting at or slightly more debt, paying down debt, than in the expectations. So from a capital allocation strategy, we're very pleased with our progress.", "Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay, thank you for that. And what about the incremental investments that you are making to fuel the cross-selling activities and such?", "Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah, Larry, this is Brent. We've made those investments. They are in our current run rate. As we talked about earlier, these were kind of strategic investments we planned on making and we would see payoffs more in the latter part of the year. So we are kind of metering these in, measuring our progress and seeing which ones are worth reinvesting in and which ones we'll stop investing in.", "Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay, and lastly, I don't know if I missed this or not, I know you indicated the complexion of the acquisitions overseas, but what about the domestic acquisitions? What were those?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Sure. Well, now it's domestic and Canada, so there were nine total, there were eight shredding, or secure information destruction acquisitions, and one consult.", "Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "And the split, Larry, to the overall bucket of acquisitions, about 88% falls in the US and Canada, and about 12% falls international.", "Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Awesome. Thank you.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Great, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hello. Thank you for the follow-up. If I looked at the $511 million in RMW 1Q 2117 versus the $507 million in 2016, where's the breakout as far as the trend, US, rest of the world? In those two numbers, what was going on? Is the rest of the world up in 2017, but US is down? Or how do I think about that mix?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah, because they are \u2013 the Regulated Waste and Compliance and the International line for revenues are little bit different. I would tell you that certainly we're probably up slightly in the US because what falls into that bucket are things like retail, healthcare, hazardous, compliance solutions which, obviously, Michael, is hampered by the pricing. And we've got growth in the international markets, as I said earlier, but obviously, they are negatively impacted by PTS and M&I. But I think if you had to look at the growth and you had it allocated between international and domestic Canada, it would be 50/50.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. So just so I understand...", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Sure.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Was international up more than the US?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "No, I think it's 50/50. There's puts and takes to both international was hampered by the patient transport exit. The US was covered by the SQ pricing. So I think by the end of the day, it's about \u2013 split it evenly 50/50 between the US and international.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Rest of the world. Okay. That helps tremendously. All right. Thanks.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Great thanks, Michael.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Charlie Alutto for closing remarks.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thanks, Kelly. Thank you for joining us today. I'm excited to announce that Stericycle recently released its 2017 sustainability update, and a new video that highlights how our services positively impact the environment.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Stericycle Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Sean McMillan, VP of Corporate Finance, you may begin your conference.", "Sean McMillan", "Thank you, and welcome to Stericycle's quarterly conference call. Joining me today -- on today's call will be Dan Ginnetti, CFO; Rich Kogler, COO; and Charlie Alutto, CEO.", "I will now read the safe harbor statement. Statements by Stericycle in this conference call that are not strictly historical are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and should be viewed with caution. Factors described in the company's Form 10-K, 10-Q as well as its other filings with the SEC could affect the company's actual results and could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from expected results. The company makes no commitment to disclose any revisions to forward-looking statements or any facts, events or circumstances after this date that may bear upon forward-looking statements.", "I will now turn it over to Dan.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti", "Thank you, Sean. The results for the third quarter are as follows: revenues were $667.9 million, up 24.9% from $534.6 million in Q3 2013. And the internal growth, excluding returns and recall revenues, was up 10.3%. Domestic revenues were $407 million -- $470.7 million, of which $454 million was domestic-regulated waste and compliance services and $16.6 million was recalls and returns. Domestic internal growth, excluding recalls and returns revenues, was up 8.6%, consisting of SQ, up 9%; and LQ, up 8%. International revenues were $197.2 million, and internal growth, adjusted for unfavorable exchange impact of $4.1 million, was up 14.3%. Acquisitions contributed $93.8 million to the growth in the quarter. Gross profit was $279.5 million or 41.9% of revenues.", "SG&A expense, including amortization, was $125.3 million or 18.8% of revenues. Net interest expense was $16.6 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $82.8 million or $0.96 per share on an as-reported basis and $1.08 adjusted for acquisitions-related expenses and other adjusted items.", "Now for the balance sheet. Our covenant debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.26 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of the revolver at the end of the quarter was approximately $568 million. In the quarter, we repurchased 198,728 shares of common stock on the open market in an amount of $23.2 million. At the end of the quarter, we have authorization to purchase an additional 5 million shares.", "Our CapEx was $22.6 million, slightly higher in the quarter due to the timing of planned projects and the successful completion of Title V incinerator upgrades. Our DSO was 62 days. Year-to-date as-reported cash from operations was $345 million. When adjusted for recall reimbursement and onetimers, cash from operation was $387.1 million.", "I will now turn it over to Rich.", "Richard T. Kogler", "Thanks, Dan. In the quarter, we closed 16 transactions, 6 domestic and 10 international. The international acquisitions were 1 in Romania, 1 in Chile, 1 in Portugal, 2 in Spain, 1 in Canada, 2 in the U.K. and 2 in Japan. Revenues from the 16 acquisitions were $3.9 million in the quarter and annualized are approximately $27.3 million. Our worldwide acquisition poolroom remains robust with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business.", "I'm pleased to report the integration of PSC continues to be on track, and the business is performing very well. As synergies are realized, margins in Q4 and 2015 will improve. Once fully integrated, this business will contribute to the continued growth of our regulated waste business.", "Our international business also performed well, delivering strong internal growth in the quarter. We experienced higher revenue growth in both Latin America and Europe. The international team remains focused on multiple revenue opportunities in all geographies. Looking ahead, we remain excited about our expanding growth opportunities. Our global acquisition strategy increases our customer base, providing long-term growth platform for selling a suite of services for health care, commercial and retail customers. These services include Sharps Management, pharma waste, StrongPak and multiple environmental compliance and communication solutions. As customers adopt multiple services, it can more than triple our revenues. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 598,900 accounts, of which approximately 577,700 were small. The remainder were large.", "In closing, we want to thank each member of our worldwide team for their strong performance and continued commitment to our customers, our shareholders and our values.", "I'll now turn it over to Charlie.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Thank you, Rich. I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2014 and 2015. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration, acquisition-related and other adjusted items.", "For 2014, we believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.26 to $4.27. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2014 will be in the range of $2.55 billion to $2.57 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and negative impact from foreign exchange rates. We anticipate 2014 internal growth rates to be: SQ, 8% to 10%; LQ, 5% to 8%; international, 6% to 8%; and recall and returns revenue between $85 million to $95 million. We believe analysts will have estimates for 2014 free cash flow between $413 million to $420 million. 2014 CapEx is anticipated to be between $82 million to $86 million. We expect a full year as-reported tax rate to be approximately 34%. This assumes a tax rate for the remainder of the year to be approximately 35%.", "Now I'd like to provide preliminary guidance for 2015. For 2015, we believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.69 to $4.75, and the share count of 86.4 million, which we are comfortable with. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2015 will be in the range of $2.82 billion to $2.87 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and negative impact from foreign exchange rates. We anticipate 2015 internal growth rates to be: SQ, 8% to 10%; LQ, 5% to 8%; international, 5% to 8%; and recall and returns revenues between $95 million to $120 million. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow in 2015 between $449 million to $460 million. 2015 CapEx is anticipated to be between $96 million to $100 million. We expect the 2015 full year as-reported tax rate to be between 35.5% to 36%.", "In closing, we are very pleased with our third quarter 2014 results and remain excited about our multiple growth opportunities for 2014 and beyond. Thank you for your time today. We'll now answer any questions. [Operator Instructions]. Connor, you can now open the Q&A queue.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair.", "Nick Hiller", "This is Nick Hiller in for Ryan Daniels. I was wondering if you could just talk a little more about the international side and what kind of drove that acceleration on the 14% internal growth?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Sure, Nick. As Rich had said in his comments, we saw strength in both Latin America, coupled with a new LQ Europe contract. Some of that European contracts were related to our U.K. patient transport business. We had success on some recent NHS tenders, offering a combination of Communication Solutions with patient transport services, which differentiate the SRCL service offering, really demonstrating that our capabilities can be shared between businesses that we have. Reminding everybody that we do come with lower margins on start-up, but LQ margins, we believe, over time. And again, just to educate everybody, these are long-term contracts, 5 to 10 years of recurring revenues, and it's a great example of our multiple services strategy.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets.", "Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "If I could just follow up on that question about the international. The guidance for 2015 is sort of where it's been, 5% to 8%. How do you explain the 14%? Was there some onetime start-up with these contracts revenue that doesn't recur? Or that -- it just seems like a big delta this quarter.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, I mean, some of the contracts do come with some start-up revenue, certainly, depending on the geography and the lines of business. We, obviously, brought the guidance up, Gary, for the remainder of the year now that we're 3 quarters through. We feel very confident in the 6% to 8% projection. And then, in 2015, we might have some comparability issues. As we look at quarter-to-quarter, we feel more comfortable on the normal range of 5% to 8%.", "Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "But -- so should we think of that 14% likely slowing quite a bit next quarter? I mean, I think, mathematically, this strong quarter brings you up for the full year. So there would appear to be some nonrecurring piece to it. That's a reasonable way to think about it, right?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, there will be a little bit of that. We also confident that will be, for the year, in the range of 6% to 8%.", "Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Great. And then just the follow-up I'd ask is we -- I've got a lot of client questions recently about the contract to transport the Ebola-related waste. I assume that that's not been significant volumes at this point and hopefully, it won't become so. But can you give us any color on that? Is that -- could that be material? Are you at all involved in preparations? Or is it literally just the 1 or 2 cases we've seen to date, where we've seen fresh reports about you transporting and incinerating stuff?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Sure, Gary. Let me give you some general comments on Ebola, then maybe touch on the part around the financial impact to Stericycle. I think that would be helpful. We have been working closely with our customers and various regulatory agencies like the CDC and the Department of Transportation, DOT. Our focus has been on safety of the general public, obviously, health care workers and our team members. Each Ebola incident is being handled on a case-by-case basis. As far as financial impact, squarely, the focus has been on safety and compliantly serving the needs of our customers. We don't have any really financial -- there's no really material financial impact and we hope there won't be any in the future.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just a follow-up on the Ebola topic, which is to say, is there a chance there might be ancillary impact to your business in the form of increased customer preparedness or changes in protocol around disposal of medical waste? Anything that might sort of give you -- sort of indirectly beneficial to your business as a result of the overall awareness?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. I think, Isaac, anytime there's awareness about segregation of waste and training for employees. I think that helps our business. As you know, we have the compliance service aspect to our SQ business, where we're consultative to all of our customers, including hospitals. I think this is showing that we are certainly in a leadership position. When you see stories about Ebola waste, Stericycle is at the forefront of those stories. So it's really, I think, been a benefit by highlighting Stericycle's leadership position in our space, which is the safely collecting, transporting disposals, medical waste in general.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "The RMS was a little light, and the 2014 guidance is coming down as a result. But the 2015 guidance for RMS is a pretty broad range with a high end fairly high. Do you see something coming through? And could you speak to the present and to the future there?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, thanks, Scott. I think -- a few things on the recall trend. We think our awareness campaign continues to be successful. And the reason for that is year-to-date, we've managed a record number of worldwide events that we've ever managed before. The events, though, have been at a lower-dollar per event when comparing it to previous year. So when we look at, this year obviously bringing the guidance down where we are 3 quarters through the year, but when we look at next year, if we continue to handle on a record number of events and there are blockbuster events on the top end of our range, that's really why we left the top end at the 120 million number, which is really no visibility we have in 2015. As you know, it's a lumpy business. We don't have a lot of visibility even as we're entering a quarter, let alone a year. But we are positive in the way we think about the fact that we just continue to handle more events, a lot of repeat customers and even new customers that we add on for projects in any quarter that we have work there.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then, touching upon the acquisitions. Six U.S., 10 international, I believe, and all in existing markets. Could you speak to small versus large and both and types? Are these all medical waste? Or are there some different areas?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti", "Yes, thank you for the question. There were 16 acquisitions in the quarter. 14 of them were medical waste, 2 were Communication Solutions, and the mix is usually about 50-50, large and small.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "And just following up on that, were the patient communication, were those U.S. or international?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti", "One was U.S., one was international.", "Operator", "Your next question was comes from the line of Barbara Noverini with Morningstar.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "You mentioned that the PSC integration is going well. Can you illustrate what milestones you've achieved thus far? And what's left to be done regarding the integration?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. I think if we take everybody back to the integration on PSC, we said we'd see areas of synergies in the long haul in route density and disposal costs. We are on track. To give you a little bit more color there, we have done a good job of getting some of the StrongPak and the legacy Stericycle hazardous waste into some of the TSDF facility. So we have seen some savings in long haul. There's still some work to be done in that area. Route density was one that would always ever be in the latter part of integration, so that will come in by 2015 and we continue to work on the disposal cost. That really comes in after we're successful of getting the waste streams into our new network of TSDFs, which as you know, we acquired 12 in an acquisition. We only had 1 previously, so now we have 13. We continue to make good progress on integration of the different departments, IT, HR, sales. I think, overall, we're little bit ahead of where we thought we'd be with respect to some of those broader initiatives.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Got it. That was helpful detail. And then the 2015 CapEx estimates that you guys are comfortable with does imply a little bit of a step-up. So are those investments that you're making because of PSC? Or is there something -- some other investments you're planning for 2015?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti", "Yes, the CapEx is in line with our normal range. It -- next year, it's about 3.4% of total revenue and in line with where we've been historically.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Erin Wilson with Merrill Lynch.", "Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Could you -- could the fuel opportunity be, I guess, opportunity for you year-over-year. Just with the fuel cost coming down, is that a meaningful tailwind for you?", "Richard T. Kogler", "Actually fuel cost, total -- we look at sort of total energy, which includes fuel. It just moved sequentially from 5.5% to 5.4%. And really, we haven't seen much of a change ourselves. Number two, that for us, we only calculate this on the sections of the company that deal with transportation, where fuel and energy apply.", "Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then, I understand you're not really directly correlated with volume trends, but what are you seeing there? And any sort of impact from the pickup in health care demand we've seen more recently?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, I think from a volume trend standpoint, we haven't seen anything out of the norm. I think last year -- if you think about this year Q1, we certainly had an impact from weather. We saw that rebound in Q2 and it continued in Q3. As far as Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act, and what that has meant in volume, we again have not seen anything material in that area, Erin. I think it's been a normal year as volume has ramped up a little bit as the year has gone on, especially on the LQ side. And I think we saw that in the LQ internal growth rate number, which came in at the high end of the range at around 8%.", "Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And lastly, can you speak to the acquisition pipeline? Where is the focus primarily by service and by geography type?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Sure, on the pipeline for acquisitions, as Rich had in his opening script, certainly, it's north of $100 million. The focus is always in geographies and business plans that we're currently in. So we stay focus really both internationally and domestic. Occasionally, we look at new countries that we have, but I would tell across all lines and all sectors in those current countries that we're in, we're active in all of those right now.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "First off, I'm wondering about gross profit margin. I was under the impression you were talking about a 45-basis-point drag from PSC, and then assuming you probably pick up the normal 10 or 15 basis points, it still would put us somewhere in the high 42s rather than the 41.9%. So it's looking like an 80-basis-point delta there. I was wondering if you can help me understand where that came from.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti", "Yes, definitely. I think the best way to look at margins is to take it sequential quarter-over-quarter. So gross margins were impacted by lower return and recall revenue in the quarter. Or by a full quarter impact of PSC and by stronger revenue growth, partially offset, though, by gross margin expansion in our core business. So let me take you through that bridge there, and I think it will add some color. Our core business is on track and did improve by greater than 10 basis points. The impact of PSC, as we forecast, was about 40 to 45 points -- basis points, unfavorable. Returns and recall is a lumpy business, as you know. And we did see the unfavorable impact of the lower revenue in the quarter by about 30 basis points. And then, the strong revenue growth that we saw in the quarter, including international at 14%, LQ at the highest end of the range, and that includes some onetime PSC project work, all came in at expected margins. And the result was an unfavorable impact of about 27 basis points. So the aggregate of these are a 41.9% gross margin.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. Okay. It looks as though -- just running the quick numbers, it looks like about what, you got 10. You've got about -- it looks like about 90 basis points. I'm still not getting the bridge from 43 to 41.9%.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti", "So if you start at 43, you're going to have 10 favorable, about 40 to 45 unfavorable, plus you're going to have 30 basis points on the lower revenues from returns and recall, and then about 27 basis points from those higher revenues from our international business and our large quantity business, being at the high end of the range, was about another 27 basis points.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. All right. And then, in terms of the tax rate and sort of the non-deductibility of some of these expenses, I would've thought -- SG&A seemed like it was more or less in line and I'm just wondering if you could help us with that as well. It seemed like SG&A was about where you thought. It didn't seem like it was an unusual number, but tax rate was quite a bit lower.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti", "Yes, with the -- are you talking about what some of the benefits of onetime tax was? Or the actual role of SG&A?", "Charles A. Alutto", "I'd go to the onetime tax.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti", "Yes, we'll -- all right, Dave. So the onetime tax was a release of our FIN 48 tax reserves, mostly a result of a lapse in the statute. These amounts are not final until they're released and remain uncertain. So as a result, they weren't in our guidance.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Just a little housekeeping on the guidance. The EPS range seems to be 10.1 to 11.2. The free cash flow range seems to be 8.7% growth to 9.7%. Are you guys doing some build or particular increase in CapEx? Is there something going on in terms of building a new incinerator or something like that happening?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti", "No. As far as we -- the question before on CapEx, that's in line with the percent of total revenue growth. So we feel comfortable on that range and the free cash flow, I think, is a good estimate. As you know, we've come out of the year conservative. But I think that's within the normal guidance that we've given you historically.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "So why is -- why would you expect free cash flow just to be a little bit lower than EPS? Is there anything abnormal about that in terms of the growth? Or that's just...", "Charles A. Alutto", "No, I think it could be better. I mean, obviously, it's a conservative view. I think if you go back to our history, they've never matched completely. Shlomo, if you go back over the years, the guidance on increases of EPS and cash flow happen. We do get inflows and outflows related to the recall and the returns business. So that has an impact on us. So you have to look at, obviously, last year was a heavy year with recalls and returns. This year hasn't been as heavy, so more cash leaving. So there's a lot of factors that come into on the free cash flow number.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay, and then just a follow-up in terms of international growth. Clearly, you guys have done a good job over there. Is there some way you can segment for us how much of that revenue might've been what I would call kind of funky-ish revenue? The patient transportation and stuff that we don't normally hear about. And how much of it is kind of the normal regulated medical waste or the ancillary services around that? And kind of following up with Gary, how much of that is what you would call a non- -- kind of start-up fees type of thing versus recurring type of revenue?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, I would you that approximately 50% of it came from newer type of service offerings, primarily the patient transport business. But you know we've got some other things in Spain as well. I don't have the exact number on how much was reoccurring. I mean, most of it is recurring, but there's always start-up costs -- start-up revenue that goes with some of those services. I don't have the breakdown. It's not -- I wouldn't say it's material. It's more of comparability when you're comparing quarter to quarters on what we think the growth rate will be in the future. But I would say, going back to your first question, about 50% is related to newer-type services like patient transport.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sean Dodge with Jefferies.", "Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Going back to hazardous waste business. The PSC acquisition added a lot of infrastructure pretty quickly. How much more do you think you need to add in the wave infrastructure, either in trucks or facilities to kind of get you to where you think you'd be optimally sized to support a national kind of footprint?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, I mean, the trucking size, just like the med waste business, we're able to add that on as business demands and how the market determines where we have to add certain vehicles. We can also share vehicles between locations if we have to. That's not as -- a big concern. We feel really comfortable with the infrastructure that we have today. Certainly, Sean, there are some geographies that if an asset comes to market, and we think will be a good fit for the business we will look at it and determine that at that point. But I think right now, we're comfortable to run a national service like we have. I think we're in a good spot, but we're always looking to add on assets and will determine those on a case-by-case basis, depending on if they become available in the marketplace.", "Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then, the sales strategy around hazardous waste, are -- is that solution being sold by the same individuals that are selling medical waste? Or are they separate? And did you acquire any type of sales platform or infrastructure or sales force along with the PSC acquisition?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, good question. I mean, we talked about that, I think, in the first call. We did get a part of infrastructure and expertise we got on the PSC deal was a very good seasoned sales team and sales process. As far as your question about are we leveraging the medical waste reps. Certainly, there's opportunities. They're working very closely together, especially in health care, where we have some really good relationships. We're bringing the PSC or we're calling the hazardous waste reps to sell that business. They know that market really well. They know lines that we can sell and certainly, we're leveraging those relationships. Together, we also have haz waste sale. We feel we have a good strong combined team because we've now integrated the Stericycle hazardous waste sales team with the PSC hazardous waste team.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Steinke with Barrington Research.", "Kevin M. Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "I was wondering if you'd be willing to quantify what you see the benefit of PSC synergies being sequentially on gross margin from 3Q to 4Q?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti", "The gross margin on it? So yes, going into Q4, you should see an improvement of about 30 to 40 basis points, which is what we've given you guidance as. That's coming off the impacts of the prior periods of 200 basis points down then 45 for 4 quarters now we're back up.", "Kevin M. Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then, on the Communication Solutions business, can you give us an update specifically on your progress towards building a common technology platform for that business and perhaps timing of rollout, and then benefit to the businesses' efficiencies and margins from that tech platform?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, thanks, Kevin. I'll spend a little time on this because I think it's important to kind of level-set where we are and what we're trying to accomplish. I think we are making good progress. I think everybody has to keep in mind that we are purchasing many small centers. They run on antiquated and outdated systems that lack scalability, so that's the issue. All aspects of the platform now are being enhanced. So when we think about what are those -- what are all those aspects, it's network service, it's telephony service through platform, the physical infrastructure or what is really the hardware, software systems like scripting, scheduling a dispatch. Dispatch is how do we get the message back to the health care provider or the customer? Our database master and our billing platform are being revamped. We're also looking at a reporting platform, not only external to the customer, but internally as well. All the above-mentioned updates and the system enhancements that I've just touched on are either in pilot or in process at this point. And some of these projects will obviously run through 2015. But why is that important? It's important because we operate in a highly fragmented market. And if we make those system investments in our platform, that obviously gives us a nice competitive advantage in the market, more reliable centers, better customer reports, that's an advantage in the marketplace. And then, obviously, the new and improved platforms, once they are finished will provide a more efficient operations, which provide better margins, and allow us to run fewer communication centers, also provide the ability to integrate acquisitions on a more timely basis. So a lot of work to be done there, but a lot that I think we're making really, really good progress on and it will be, for us, a differentiator in the marketplace.", "Kevin M. Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Great. If you could just sneak one quick housekeeping in. What's the impact from currency that you're factoring into your guidance for the remainder of the year?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti", "Yes. You're going to see about an $8 million impact in Q4, and we see and other analysts out there looking at that and then going into 2015 of about $30 million to $40 million.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Thank you, Connor. Thank you, all, for participating on today's call. We appreciate the continued interest in Stericycle. I look forward to seeing everybody on the road during the next couple of months, and have a great evening. Thanks, everybody.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.

At this time I would like welcome everyone to the Stericycle Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.", "Laura Murphy, Vice President of Corporate Finance. You may begin.", "Laura Murphy", "Welcome to Stericycle\u2019s quarterly conference call. Joining me on today\u2019s call will be Frank ten Brink, CFO; Rich Kogler, COO and Mark Miller, Chairman and CEO. I will now read the Safe Harbor statement. Statements by Stericycle in this conference call that are not strictly historical are forward looking. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, and should be viewed with caution. Factors described in the company\u2019s Form 10-K, 10-Q\u2019s, as well as its other filings with the SEC could affect the Company\u2019s actual results and could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from expected results. The Company makes no commitment to disclose any revisions to forward-looking statements or any facts, events or circumstances after this date that may bear upon forward-looking statements. I will now turn it over to Frank. ", "Frank J.M. ten Brink", "Thank you, Laura. The results for the fourth quarter are as follows. Revenues were $393.5 million, up 25.5% from $313.5 million in the fourth quarter of \u201909. Domestic revenues were $292.6 million. Domestic regulated waste and compliance services revenues were $250 million, and the returns and recall revenues were $42.6 million. The international revenues were $100.9 million, including an unfavorable exchange impact of $1 million. ", "Domestic internal growth, excluding returns management, was up approximately 8%, consisting of small quantity up 9%, and large quantity up 6%. International internal growth adjusted for exchange was up approximately 8%. Acquisitions, less than 12 months old, contributed $32.5 million to the growth in the quarter. Gross profit was $182.5 million or 46.4% of revenues, and SG&A expense was $75.7 million or 19.2% of revenues. ", "Net interest expense was $10.7 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $50 million or $0.50 per share on an as-reported basis, and $0.69 adjusted for after-tax transaction expenses related to various \u2013 and related also other adjustments. At the end of the quarter, our revolver borrowings were approximately $175 million and is floating at LIBOR plus 75 basis points. ", "The unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $491 million. As we mentioned before on October 15, 2010, we received a $400 million private placement, and those proceeds were used to prepay part of the term debt that we have and reduce the revolver. We purchased 709,867 shares of common stock on the open market in the quarter in an amount of $50.7 million. ", "Capital spending was $12.4 million. And our DSO at the end of the quarter was 51 days. The cash provided from operations was $325.7 million for the year, which includes $23 million of cash received in the fourth quarter from our customers to be used for recalled product reimbursements. Those were my comments, I will now turn it over to a Rich.", "Richard T. Kogler", "", "Thanks, Frank. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 485,400 accounts, of which over 472,000 were small and the remainder were large. We continue to see strong growth worldwide driven by new account acquisition and the adoption of our expanding portfolio of service offerings. With our large quantity customers we have multiple service offerings, which add to the value of each account. And today less than 20% of our LQ customers are using our multiple services, leaving more than 80% of our LQ customer base available for growth. ", "Likewise, with our small quantity customers, we offer multiple services that increase the value of an account. And today approximately a third of our SQ customers utilize multiple services, leaving two-thirds of our customer base available for growth. In closing, we want to thank each member of our worldwide team for their solid performance that led to a record year in 2010. And we especially want to recognize our recall team for successfully managing the large spike in volume we experienced on a few major recalls. ", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark. ", "Mark C. Miller", "", "Thanks Rich. I\u2019d now like to provide insight on our current outlook for 2011. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements. During the fourth quarter, we completed 17 acquisitions, six domestic, and 11 international. The incremental revenue impact in the fourth quarter of 2010 from these acquisitions was $8.8 million. The annualized revenue of these acquisitions is approximately $65 million. ", "Now keep in mind, our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures and transactional expenses related acquisitions. Now I\u2019d like to provide you the outlook for 2011. We believe the analyst EPS estimates will be in the range $2.76 to $2.80 per share, which we were comfortable with. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2011 will be in the range of $1.55 to $1.58 billion depending on assumptions for growth in foreign exchange. ", "We believe analysts will have an adjusted estimate for free cash flow between $278 million and $283 million and as reported free cash flow of $255 million to $260 million after taking into account the $23 million cash outflow for the recalled product reimbursement. CapEx is anticipated between $45 million and $55 million. ", "In closing, we are very excited about the tremendous growth opportunities in 2011 and beyond. We thank you for your time and an operator will now go into the question-and-answer section.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Jonathan Ellis from Banc of America - Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Jonathan Ellis - Banc of America/Merrill Lynch", "", "Thank you. The first question on the returns and recall business, can you give us some sense if any of that revenue from existing projects will have an impact, a material impact in the first quarter of 2011? And then can you also update us on your guidance for the returns management business in 2011? Is it still $75 million to $90 million of revenue?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink", "Yes. So we had one acquisition in that space, so the guidance now for that is $80 million to $100 million. And any overage from Q4 is really not that material. It happens every quarter a little bit, but it remains a very uneven business, but our guidance for the year is $80 million to $100 million.", "Jonathan Ellis - Banc of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And can you talk a little bit about the acquisitions that you made, 6 domestic, 11 international? I guess, I would ask or can you breakdown that in terms of types of acquisitions, MedWaste versus other services, and then also geographic, which countries those acquisitions were in?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink", "Sure. First, the geographies. Out of the 11 international there were five in the U.K., two in Mexico, two in Brazil, one in Argentina and one in Romania. Of the total quantity of 17, 16 were regulated waste and compliance services businesses and one was a returns management business, recall management. ", "Jonathan Ellis - Banc of America/Merrill Lynch", "The next question I want to ask about is just on the multiple service offerings for LQ and SQ. And I want to make sure I understand correctly sort of the framework here, should we be working under the assumption that all LQ accounts represent the addressable market right now for multiple services, or is there a sub segment of LQ customers that are not eligible because they are based abroad or because of their profile?", "Mark C. Miller", "Yeah, I think you can assume that the multiple services that we offer are for the most part applicable to all geographies. It may not be applicable to every single customer in every geography. I mean, but for the most part what we have on the table now are things that benefit customers no matter what regulatory environment they are in. ", "Jonathan Ellis - Banc of America/Merrill Lynch", "And would that same principle apply to the SQ customer base, that we should assume a 100% of SQ customers for the most part are eligible for multiple services?", "Mark C. Miller", "Yes.", "Jonathan Ellis - Banc of America/Merrill Lynch", "", "Okay. Any update on some of these, specifically SteriSafe and Bio Systems, I know you\u2019ve talked about in the past. In terms of the rollout outside of the United States, I think you had been rolling out commercially in Canada, but any update on either Europe or potentially any progression in South America?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink", "", "Yes, there is a continuation of the rollout in the U.K., Canada and Ireland and the next area that will get focus is Latin America.", "Jonathan Ellis - Banc of America/Merrill Lynch", "I guess I want to just ask about the domestic business for a moment. If we look at some of your customers, I know specifically there have been some pilot projects ongoing with HCA, related to different types of service offerings or contract structures. Can you provide us any update on where your relationship stands with HCA after the pilot projects have been completed now? And then also, any other major customers or hospital networks where these same types of pilot projects are ongoing?", "Mark C. Miller", "", "You know, normally it has not been our practice to comment specifically on individual customers. I think since HCA has been a topic, I think you have talked about it, Jonathan, we will go ahead and tell you that where it stands right now is that, you know following the pilot project that we are involved in, HCA decided, because they are one of the larger health systems in the United States, to take their 15 divisions, are multiple hospitals in each division. They said take them to market for a total waste stream management service. We were very pleased with the outcome, because we obviously bid on the work. We were awarded over 70% of the work at the end.", "It basically doubled our revenues with HCA. So we are pleased with the outcome. And I think from our standpoint it validates that for this particular type of customer our multiple service offering model works.", "Jonathan Ellis - Banc of America/Merrill Lynch", "And are there any, you don\u2019t obviously have to speak specifically at this point, but are there any other hospitals, major customers that are also looking at possible pilot projects along the same lines?", "Mark C. Miller", "", "As I said, I really don\u2019t like to generally comment about what customers are doing for confidentiality reasons.", "Jonathan Ellis - Banc of America/Merrill Lynch", "Great, thanks guys.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels from William Blair & Company. Your line is now open.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company", "Yeah, thanks. Good evening, everyone. I was hoping just for a quick additional commentary, if you could, on the impact of the cash flows from the recall business, the $23 million, is that a prepayment for services, number one, or is that cash that you\u2019ll use to actually go buy product off-the-shelf or any color there on what that is would be helpful?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink", "Now, we will at times get cash from a party that we do a recall for that is used in absence to reimburse their customers for our product that has been returned to us. So we in essence, do the service. This is a service we provide, but since it's not officially restricted cash in an accounting term. It has to unfortunately be reported in our cash balance and so it shows up as a positive cash inflow. That's why the highlighted it. But we first, we in essence see that as not our cash, it's a cash that we manage on behalf of our customer, and it goes straight to their customers when products are returned.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company", "Okay, very helpful. Then, obviously, a great quarter on the M&A front, particularly internationally. If you look at 2011, have you guys maybe pulled forward some of the business, at least domestically, because of some of the tax law changes that were potentially, but did take place, or do you still feel that the pipeline is going to be as strong as it was, even post such a good Q4? ", "Frank J.M. ten Brink", "", "I think there is no doubt that especially in the US, obviously, the tax law that was anticipated to change with respect to capital gains stimulated people to do deals and close them before year-end. Now at the end it didn't change, so it didn't really make a difference for most of them. But I think it did stimulate some influx in that and it gave us a good platform. But it will continue. I mean, it\u2019s a $100 million worldwide still in the pipeline, despite having done those deals, so we see good activity both domestically and internationally in multiple geographies. It continues to be good. ", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company", "Okay, great. And I know you guys aren\u2019t going to break on new client adds because that is not particularly relevant anymore, but I was hoping maybe for some color commentary just on the RS waste compliance. I know that\u2019s kind of the newest incremental service offering you are adding, and I'm curious how that\u2019s been received, kind of as you have rolled out that over the last year or so across the US?", "Mark C. Miller ", "", "I think overall the traction is very good. We said there early on I mean we were not going to give detail on quantity or things like that, but it is at least a $200 million opportunity, and potentially is one that we can move into other geographies, and expect to do so. So, we are very pleased with it. It\u2019s been a good service offering to kind of add to our portfolio. ", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company", "Then maybe two more quick ones and I will hop off. Just in regards to the end market, obviously hospitals facing a little bit more pressure, you know this discussion of Medicaid rate cuts in some of the budgets. And I am curious on the pricing front if you are seeing any more hesitation at all with those customers on pricing, or if they are being a little more cautious on some of the ancillary compliance offerings, or if that\u2019s not been very impactful for you guys thus far? ", "Mark C. Miller ", "I think because we have multiple service offerings and they help the hospitals basically save money, become more efficient, outsource labor and stay compliant in all of that, we have not seen any pushback. In fact, I think our growth rates reflect, you know the hospitals continue to look at our services as something that makes economic and overall sense for them. ", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company", "Thank you. And the final one, you mentioned the ACA contract that\u2019s going to double your revenue, was that reflected in the quarter? Did you see those new contract awards come into play or is that going to be in 2011 where we will kind of see the uptick there?", "Mark C. Miller", "2011.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company", "", "Okay, thanks a lot, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Manthey from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.", "David Manthey - Robert W. Baird", "Thank you, good afternoon. I was wondering in terms of the guidance that you're offering here, I assume it excludes any kind of restructuring expenses, but could you tell us if it includes or excludes the transactional acquisition expenses? And then the acquisition integration expenses, could you address both of those separately? ", "Frank J.M. ten Brink", "It does include the integration expenses, but does not include the transactional expenses that are listed separately on our press release.", "David Manthey - Robert W. Baird", "Okay, and the way that\u2019s been running here in the past year is somewhere between $0.5 million and $1 million seems to be the range? ", "Frank J.M. ten Brink", "Yeah, it really depends very heavily on deal flow. We obviously have some expenses still on pending transactions that are continuing. So, I mean it will continue because we are acquisitive and the pipeline is robust. ", "David Manthey - Robert W. Baird", "Okay, great. Then as you look out here, I am just wondering about the growth rate longer-term, what do you see as the most important growth drivers over the next three to five years? Could you talk about growth initiatives that you're focused on now that are both big enough and growthy enough to move the needle for Stericycle going forward? Which are the ones that you're looking at and saying, these are the very promising ones?", "Mark C. Miller", "", "Well, I think just kind of trying to address that, I think that for us it is the multiple services. Remember, we are looking at this year 8% to 10% in SQ and 5% to 8% growth in LQ. Good, strong organic growth blended for both international and domestic. But as I said in my prepared comments, what we are really looking at is an expanding portfolio of services. And, for example, we mentioned RX Waste, which domestically is a $200 million plus opportunity for us that has really just begin to barely touch our customer base. And as I mentioned in my comments, I mean it\u2019s somewhere between 20% or only a third of our customers, depending LQ, SQ, have even adopted more than one of our service offerings. So, I think that\u2019s going to be a large part of the growth driver. And then we will continue to do our acquisitions because, as Frank said, we are an acquisitive company. So the combination of the two should really funnel the growth or fuel the growth going forward.", "David Manthey - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. Then, finally, in terms of the international contribution to your growth, could you talk about the markets that you're in now as you look at those which of those are the most promising? It looks like you're making some moves here in Brazil and South America. Could you talk about the markets that you see as the brightest?", "Mark C. Miller", "I think of the international markets, the markets that we are in, we continue to focus our strategy of continuing to build leadership position in each of those. So as you noticed, the ones we were doing were expansion geography within the country or tuck-ins within the country. So, we will continue to do those plays.", "There is other countries that we are looking at that will won't make an entry until we see the right combination. But I think the key is get the right kind of platform, look at the consolidation opportunities, stabilize and integrate that business, and then post that bring the know-how and systems to expand services into those countries. And also vice versa, we pick up ideas and learn from their organizations as well of things we can bring back to the domestic market.", "", "David Manthey - Robert W. Baird", "", "Okay, thank you very much. ", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Levine from JPMorgan. Your line is open. ", "Scott Levine - JPMorgan", "Good afternoon. Can you give us the debt leverage calculation based on your covenant for the quarter and remind us what you project that to be upon closing of the HWS acquisition?", "", "Frank J.M. ten Brink", "So, the debt at the end was 2.15. That compared to 2.16 at the end of the third quarter and 2.51 at the end of fourth quarter of last year. It\u2019s at the low end of our range. Our range that we are very comfortable with is between 2 and 3. I think if the consumption is done of the transaction with HWS that could go in between 2.5 to 3, depending on other acquisitions and activities. ", "Scott Levine - JPMorgan", "Got it. And then on the returns, there is obviously huge few quarters here and it seems like most of all the upside is really from recalls. But if we look at your guidance for '11 relative to what your initial guidance was for '10, it doesn't really project much underlying growth, I guess, in returns, if you ex out the recall side, I guess I would ask if you focus on the returns side of that business, are you seeing growth, are you seeing increase in adoption rates or penetration rates? And what thoughts should we have regarding the secular growth potential of the returns business over a 3 to 5 year horizon?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink", "", "I think the returns business overall is obviously a slower growth than it has been like the recalls for us. The recalls remain very uneven, but when it does come with larger recalls it does fall very nicely to the bottom line. And so that gives us obviously a great cash inflow into the business that we can then use in that business and elsewhere. ", "", "Scott Levine - JPMorgan", "Maybe lastly, we are now following the debate regarding the healthcare legislation. Have you seen any impact in your business or do you anticipate any impact in your business associated with the way the legislative process places out or is this a nonevent in your opinion?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink", "", "I think overall, as we have said before, the healthcare reform should increase volume with our small customers. We do see it overall as a positive to our business. It moves volumes potentially a little bit from hospitals to the small quantity generators, so we don't think it will be a negative.", "Scott Levine - JPMorgan", "Okay. Maybe lastly, the tax rate came in a little bit higher, Frank, then you were projecting, is this quarter's rate a good go-forward rate for 2011?", "Frank J. M. ten Brink", "The thing is when you have larger transactional expenses many of those could relate to a stock deal and an acquisition, those are not tax deductible. On kind of an operational level without those transactional expenses the tax rate was about 37%.", "Scott Levine - JPMorgan", "", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Thanks, good afternoon. A couple of housekeeping up front. I am sorry, I came on a little late, I missed RMS contribution.", "Mark C. Miller", "The RMS revenues?", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Yes.", "Mark C. Miller", "Revenues were $42.6 million in the quarter.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.", "And then on the acquisitions did you give the, you gave annualized what the contribution will be, but did you give that split U.S. versus international?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink ", "", "We did not give the split U.S./international. I need to look that up. I don't have it right at my fingertips here.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. ", "Okay, do you know, was it lumpy to one side or the other?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink ", "No, it\u2019s fairly even between the two maybe slightly more on the domestic, it's fairly even.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. ", "Thanks. I will catch up with you later on that. It looks like as far as your organizational structure with how you manage international operations kind of shifted at the year-end. Could you take us through that a little bit more on how you are looking at your global operations, how you are operating them and how you are approaching M&A? Thanks.", "Mark C. Miller", "The international business, each country has a country management team. And then we also have built up area management teams for managing the Latin America, for managing Europe. And the thought process is really to have as much of the resource as close to the customers in the markets as possible. And those regional managers then report into Rich Kogler, who is the Chief Operating Officer.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. ", "Thanks. One after this, but to just off of RMS now hearing the large number. I heard someone asked the question earlier, how much of that will trickle into the next quarter and I think I asked last quarter, is there a weekly or monthly trickle on it. The answer was multi quarters, and I think, I heard this time, no it doesn't trickle. Could you just clarify that for us, please?", "Mark C. Miller", "You don\u2019t. I mean the question was more, was there a large recall that it would have a major influence in the other. Obviously recall span through the year. That\u2019s part of a base of business that we have in that. And that\u2019s part of the base guidance that we would have for $80 million to $100 million.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.", "", "Okay. And then just on margins, I see some fuel drivers picking up. Could we just talk about what were some of the gives and takes in the quarter with regard to the cost lines? Thanks. ", "Frank J.M. ten Brink", "", "Yeah, if you look really at the impact of mix on the business with fat higher returns management with large recalls, that maybe at a 30 bip headwinds. And then the base business as a whole, including the other parts of the RMS and the base RMS business, was about 36 basis points better versus, and this is all versus the prior quarter.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.", "", "Okay, thanks. And those are the big drivers. How is energy overall as a percent of revenue right now?", "Mark C. Miller", "", "As a percent of revenue it\u2019s 5.2%.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.", "", "Okay, thanks. And just any update on, are hedges going into place on fuel, is that necessary at this point?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink", "We don\u2019t hedge fuel and have never done so.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Okay.", "Frank J.M. ten Brink", "Again, we have the ability to pass through and have done so when that\u2019s necessary. ", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Are you implementing those at this point?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink", "Again, if it is required, we will. And so, it\u2019s again, it\u2019s an ongoing process for us. If you keep looking at, you obviously look at both the fuel and the energy side, we\u2019ve had some efficiencies on the energy side, so I mean, that has offset some of that increase.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Okay, thanks. I will turn it over.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Owczarski from Avondale Partners.", "Daniel Owczarski - Avondale Partners", "Yes, thanks and good afternoon. I would like to, sorry for beating up this recall issue, but can you talk maybe a little bit about the overall market, what\u2019s happened in the last year or so? I know we\u2019ve seen the FDA be more active, but are these overall recalls larger in size where companies don\u2019t have the in-house resources and you\u2019re helping them out, or is the FDA going after smaller companies that don\u2019t have any experience? What\u2019s the overall trends that you\u2019re able to take advantage of here?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink", "Well, I think the overall trend is that the FDA definitely has tightened up. And even now the latest step with Food Modernization Act, it kind of expands the powers of the FDA and gives them the right to recall certain products. So the FDA definitely has more powers now than it did before and it\u2019s enforcing more. It will remain an uneven business for us. It has been a great year. There have been larger recalls. The quantity of recalls, again, and the awareness campaign continues to work and that we do more recalls and also in more industries. And that\u2019s continuously also with the acquisition that we did, it expands the capabilities. So we are allocating resources there and foresee that that comes. ", "But at the same time in giving guidance we really don't know what the amount of recalls are going to be in a year. And we\u2019ve had that happen to us in '09, where we were probably getting ahead of us a little bit in the guidance and then there were no large recalls in that year. And if there are, great, then everyone will see the positive. But if there aren't, then we haven't over-extended ourselves in the guidance.", "Daniel Owczarski - Avondale Partners", "", "Right. And then for the Rx Waste program now that it\u2019s fully rolled out, are those, are they kind of the first adopters? Or do we think that that, is that mostly targeted towards medical offices, or do you target the pharmaceutical manufacturers as well? And what do those pharma manufacturers do right now for their waste? ", "Frank J.M. ten Brink", "So the key here is the hospitals. We do look at, in the future at manufacturers and retail, because they have to dispose of that too. So we are addressing each market sector over time, but hospitals has been the first focus. ", "Daniel Owczarski - Avondale Partners", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Greg Halter from Soleil Group. Your line is open.", "Greg Halter - Soleil Group", "", "Yeah, thank you, good afternoon. ", "Frank J.M. ten Brink", "Good afternoon.", "Greg Halter - Soleil Group", "Frank, I know you touched on the tax rate. Is the 37% a good figure to use on a go forward basis?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink", "Yes.", "Greg Halter - Soleil Group", "Okay. And regarding the M&A activities, are you seeing more or less competition for deals? And are the prices you are paying higher or lower than they have been?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink", "I think our trend in general has been that our price is in-line with what it has been in the past. I would say that in most of the markets in the past, the most overheated market probably was the U.K. and Ireland, which after the '08 crash kind of came back to normal. And so, but in most of the markets things have been rational and logical, and have really meant that our multiple has been fairly stable. ", "Greg Halter - Soleil Group", "Okay. And on the fuel side again, are you doing anything in regard to new vehicles that might be out there that you can use? ", "Mark C. Miller", "Well, we are starting to bring hybrid trucks into our fleet, not only for the environmental benefit, but also to address fuel. And so far although we have a limited number of those running, we are seeing good results. ", "", "Greg Halter - Soleil Group", "All right. And I noticed there was a caption on the income statement of plant closure costs. What is that related to?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink", "", "At times when we obviously acquire businesses we consolidate. This was the case also with respect to the business in RMS. It could happen in any of it, in medical waste side, where we don't need certain locations because we have infrastructure in place, so that\u2019s what that relates to.", "Greg Halter - Soleil Group", "", "Okay, and one last one. What are your plans on the salesforce in terms of additions either in the field or folks in call centers and so forth?", "Mark C. Miller", "You know the way we\u2019ve kind of looked at SG&A, and you have seen our guidance is that we\u2019ll continue to use the SG&A to feed the (Inaudible). So, I think we look at the growth engines that we have and the customer base that we are trying to address and then we staff accordingly. And as we\u2019ve seen, you know we are doing a pretty good job of balancing SG&A spend with the growth. I think we are getting the growth rates that we want.", "Greg Halter - Soleil Group", "Great, always good to have those pocket aces. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of [Kevin Lee] from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. ", "Unidentified Analyst ", "Yeah, just, most of my questions have been answered, but just a quick clarification follow-up. The guidance for 2011, does that include any contribution from HWS? I think you guys have mentioned briefly, but I didn't catch it earlier. I apologize. ", "Frank J.M. ten Brink ", "", "No, no it does not, because that transaction has not been closed yet. We would only include acquisitions that have been closed.", "Unidentified Analyst ", "Okay, got it. So I think it still targeted, I think for Q2, probably back half of this year close? ", "Frank J.M. ten Brink", "", "That's not unreasonable.", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "Okay, that is fair. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Rick Skidmore from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open ", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs", "Good afternoon. Just a quick question. If I look at your acquisition revenue that you reported in your returns revenue, it looks like your organic revenue only grew about $5 million in the quarter, about 1.5% or so. And that seems to be a slowdown versus the prior quarter. Can you just talk about what you're seeing organically in the business in the fourth quarter that may have caused that? ", "Frank J.M. ten Brink", "", "Are we talking the recall business or which part, because that calc is not correct.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs", "Well, I am just taking your numbers that you report in the press release and your returns number of $32 million of acquisitions and $42 million of RMS, which is $75 million. And your revenue year-over-year is up only $80 million. So $5 million comes from what I would assume would be the base business.", "Frank J.M. ten Brink", "No, obviously, the absolute number, you are mixing up two things. You are mixing growth with absolute in a quarter. Obviously, there was returns and recall business in '09. Okay. So, I can take you through those numbers separately, but that\u2019s not the correct calc.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs", "Okay and then\u2026", "Frank J.M. ten Brink", "", "The internal growth, if you look at it excluding all the factors for just as we said in our scripted part for the business, for the SQ, LQ domestic business was about 8% internal growth and any international internal growth was about 8%. And then you have \u2013 we normally don't do the recalls and returns business in a growth number because it is so swinging in fact that one was a 161% growth factor, if you look at it from a percentage point of view. We think it's not fairly the right way to project that. So in absolute terms, that was a business that did $42.6 million in revenues and in the prior year that was $16.1 million.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, maybe you can just take it off-line a little bit later. Second question would be your M&A. With new acquisitions does that, what kind of margin models do those come in at? Are they higher or lower and I mean does the international businesses that you're acquiring, are they higher or lower than your overall margins? ", "", "Mark C. Miller ", "The businesses that we acquired had margin levels, not dissimilar from what we're running in the overall business and the SG&A however is higher. So the SG&A practice for them was higher than what we're running in the total business.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions at this time.", "Mark C. Miller", "We thank everybody for your time and attention. We look forward to our next call and everybody have a great year. Take care.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.

Ma'am, you may begin.", "Elizabeth L. Brandel - Vice President, Finance", "Thank you very much and welcome to Stericycle third quarter conference call.

Revenues grew $34.1 million to $237.3 million, up 16.8% from $203.3 million in Q3 of \u201906. Internal growth for the Company was $22.9 million or 11.6%, which is adjusted for the divested to some assets of STG and foreign exchange. Domestic growth was 11.6% and international growth adjusted for exchange and divestiture was also 11.6%. Domestic growth consisted of SQ up over 10%, LQ up 6% and returns management growth of $5.6 million.", "Gross profit was $106.8 million or 45% of revenues, and SG&A expense was $44.6 million or 18.8% of revenues. Operating income was $61.9 million or 26.1% of revenues. Net interest expense was $8.6 million for $7.3 million in \u201906 due to increase borrowings related to acquisitions and repurchases of shares completed in the quarter. Net income was $22.9 million or $0.37 per share.", "At the end of the quarter, the revolver borrowings were approximately $456 million and the unused portion of our revolver is approximately $324 million. In August, we increased our revolver facility from $650 million to $850 million, and extended the maturity date to August 2012.", "We repurchased approximately 757,000 shares of common stock on the open market in an amount of approximately $36.5 million. Since the beginning of the repurchase program, on a split adjusted basis, we purchased the total over 7.5 million shares. We still have authorization to purchase an additional 3.7 million shares. Our CapEx in the quarter was $14.5 million. The DSO in the quarter was 59 days, and the cash provided from operation was 57.7 million.", "Now, a brief recap of the nine months numbers. For the nine months ended September 30 \u201907, revenues increase to $681.2 million, an increase of 17.3% from the same period a year ago. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 44.9% for the nine months ended \u201907 versus 44.2% for the same period, the prior year. Earnings per share increased to $1.5 from $0.84 per diluted share in the same period a year ago, and that\u2019s split adjusted, and the cash flow from operations was $128.1 million for the first nine months of \u201907.", "I will now turn it over to Rich.", "Richard T. Kogler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Thanks Frank. We want to thank each member of our worldwide team for their solid performance and continued commitment to our customers and shareholders. We enjoyed strong sales growth in all of our business segments in the quarter.", "The SQG growth was primarily driven by SteriSafe with two-thirds of new SteriSafe customers choosing select and preferred. SteriSafe contributed approximately 53% of total small customer revenues. LQG sales growth was driven by the continued option of our Bio Systems offering and new LQG and Med waste contracts.", "In summary, we ended Q3 with approximately 384,300 accounts, of which approximately 374,900 were small and the remainder large.", "I will turn it over to Mark.", "Mark C. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Rich. I would now like to provide insight on our current outlook for the remainder of 2007 and provide a preliminary guidance for 2008. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements.", "During the third quarter, we completed two domestic acquisitions, and in addition in early October, we completed one international acquisition. The incremental revenue impact in 2007 for these latest acquisitions would be approximately $8.6 million, of which $2.2 million was in the third quarter.", "The annualized revenues of these three acquisitions is approximately $26 million. Keeping these items in mind, we believe that analysts may fine tune our 2007 models to reflect revenues between $917 million and $923 million, and estimates for EPS of $1.41 to $1.42.", "Now, I would like to provide a preliminary outlook for 2008, but please keep in mind that a preliminary guidance does not include future acquisitions or divestitures. We believe that analysts\u2019 EPS estimates will be in the range of $1.64 to $1.68, which we are comfortable with. We believe that analysts\u2019 estimates of revenue for 2007 would be in the range of approximately $995 million to $1.015 billion depending upon assumptions of growth in foreign exchange rates. We believe analysts will have estimates for net income between $147 million and $150 million, depending on their assumptions of margin improvement and interest expense. And analysts will have estimates for free cash flow between $140 million and $145 million, with our CapEx anticipated between $45 and $55 million.", "In closing, we are very excited about the tremendous growth opportunities in 2008 and beyond.", "We thank you for you time and operator will now switch over to Q&A.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions].", "Our first question comes from Scott Schneeberger from CIBC World Markets.", "Scott Schneeberger - CIBC World Markets", "Hey, good afternoon, guys. How are you?", "Frank J.M. Ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer", "Good afternoon.", "Scott Schneeberger - CIBC World Markets", "I guess I would like to just start out just talking about recalls. I missed I think, Frank, you had said was that the returns on recalls growth, I had missed the number. Could you please share that again?", "Frank J.M. Ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer", "It was $5.6 million over last year from a growth point of view. And in total, it was $22.3 million", "Scott Schneeberger - CIBC World Markets", "Okay. Thank you. Staying on that topic the\u2026 that\u2019s something you had a lot of success within the second quarter and obviously an exciting growth business for you. Could you just speak a little bit, I guess to\u2026 is that an industry that\u2019s in rapid growth, I mean, we see headlines frequently about consumer products being recalled. Is it just what we are seeing in the news that leads to believe that that\u2019s growing rapidly? Or are there two signs we are seeing that you just speak to that I will appreciate it.", "Frank J.M. Ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer", "Well, Scott, I think from my prospective, not only we had a very solid year from the big recall activity that we are seeing. But our sense that there is a growing awareness of the core issue, because it\u2019s happening beyond just the classic space of pharmaceutical and over the counter products. You see it happening and in durable products, you see it happening in consumer products of a variety. And so, our sense is that there\u2019s growing awareness and pressure and that\u2019s really for us one of the keys is as we keep building the awareness of our capabilities and also expanding what we can offer to our customers really helping our growth potential.", "Scott Schneeberger - CIBC World Markets", "All right. Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. The\u2026 I guess, shifting gears a little bit, the\u2026 actually I will stay on that, for recalls, obviously, a lumpy business and if that grows as part\u2026 as one of your segments, do you envision breaking out returns in recalls going forward, just so, we are able\u2026 we appreciate the \u201908 guidance, but just so we are able to breakout our models and consider the lumpiness factor.", "Mark C. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I think for us it\u2019s though to segment or separate because often we may have an agreement with the customer that may include services enhance and encompass the returns management, we have it now capabilities for coupon and rebate management. So, new additional services or the efficiency checks and affectivity checks and retrieval capabilities, often they get wrapped together. So, it\u2019s very, very tough to distinguish it because it leverages same structures, similar sales force, execution and like. So, at this point, we don\u2019t have an easy way to break that out.", "Scott Schneeberger - CIBC World Markets", "Okay. Understood, so we shouldn\u2019t anticipate that\u2026 and any confusion. Okay. Now, shifting gears, is, Rich, in Bio Systems, could you talk about how many markets what\u2019s rollout to what\u2026 what the plan is for further growth? Just kind of speaking of the footprint.", "Richard T. Kogler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Yes, we been rolling out pretty steadily now. And I think we were at in terms of penetration in the U.S., is probably 25%, possibly 30% of our target accounts. Although, like a lot of our services as the word gets out there, we get interest from labs and other and other people, so that market kind of continues to expand. I think the other thing to consider is we haven\u2019t begun to move into foreign markets. So, we have basically all the international platform that\u2026 this will be applicable to.", "Scott Schneeberger - CIBC World Markets", "Great. Sounds good. One kind of more the model housekeeping question. Your tax rate was 38% in the quarter, a little bit lower than I had anticipated. Is that a result of maybe some acquisition, maybe something international, or something else?", "Richard T. Kogler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "No, it\u2019s really kind of little bit of a year-to-date, a just down sort of year-to-date number, which right now is at 38.45 versus 38.5 before. And so, I think, overall, we are going to be right into that bandwidth maybe for the next year guidance, 38.5 is probably good rate to use.", "Scott Schneeberger - CIBC World Markets", "Fair enough. And just as far as fourth quarter, something in the similar range in the 38 to 38.5.", "Richard T. Kogler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Yes.", "Scott Schneeberger - CIBC World Markets", "Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for all the help out there.", "Richard T. Kogler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Manthey from Robert W. Baird.", "David Manthey - Robert W. Baird", "Hi. Thank you very much. Could you discuss infection control and/or any new initiatives that might be out there for you? And as it relates to that specific initiative, is that primarily for hospitals, or is it some service that you can offer to small customer as well?", "Mark C. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Most of the activities that we have done in the infection control research and pilot phase are targeted towards the large quantity customers at this point. And they would have applicability in other segments, but right now most of our research is focused on the LQ space. Part of that as we think, over the coming years, the awareness factor and also coming on [ph] infection will increase as hospitals have to do more reporting and there is more visibility as to what\u2019s happening in terms of hospital acquired infections.", "David Manthey - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. Thank you. And should we be concerned all about fuel cost or labor or any other cost that are impacting you at this time?", "Richard T. Kogler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Fuel has been a challenged this year, but it\u2019s been challenged in prior years. And although, our guidance right now that we gave you assumes that we are sort of that current fuel prices and energy prices. The good news is our team has been very good at seeking out efficiencies to offset cost, and more importantly, our contracts allow us to do fuel pass-throughs. So, we have done that I think pretty effectively to counter the higher energy cost.", "David Manthey - Robert W. Baird", "And finally maybe you could talk about pricing just in your core services, how does the competitive landscape look to you today? Is it\u2026 are the pricing pressures getting greater or last sort of the same?", "Richard T. Kogler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "I think more of the same. I mean it is competitive business and there are many competitors out there that we compete with in all of the markets that were in. And I guess, that being said, that we have obvious competed effectively and we haven\u2019t seen our change in pricing.", "David Manthey - Robert W. Baird", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ryan Daniels from William Blair.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company", "Yes, good afternoon, guys. Couple of quick housekeeping questions upfront. Do you have on hand the number of new large quantity generator accounts and Bio Systems account during the quarter?", "Richard T. Kogler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Yes, for the new Med waste contracts the large quantity was 57, and we have captured 75 new Bio Systems accounts.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company", "Okay. And the how about SteriSafe editions during the quarter, do you have that number?", "Richard T. Kogler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "SteriSafe right now stands at about 114,000 total accounts.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company", "Okay. And what percentage of those given the continued strength of signing up initially towards the more premium services, do you have of those 114 on premium?", "Richard T. Kogler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Right now, we have\u2026 in the quarter, we had over two-thirds taking select and preferred. And year-to-date, we are over 21% on select and preferred. So, it\u2019s new height for us.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company", "Okay. Great. And then, Frank, in the years guidance for 2008 or Mark,  whoever wants to address this. Can you give us a feel for what's implicit in there from the returns and recall business I know this year you got it that towards $70 million number, where do you see that going, is part of your \u201908 guidance?", "Mark C. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think from our perspective when we gave the ranges on revenues, we take the underlying growth of that business is not 10% per annum. It\u2019s hard to judge and peel out what the base line is. And the ranges we gave you was a $70 million to $85 million number for 2008.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company", "Okay.", "Mark C. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer", "And there through process is there. So, we have had some pretty big recalls, which have been favorable effects in Q2 and Q3, not sure whether we will capture those same levels next year, and if we get bigger recalls, then the momentum continues. It could be better, but we wanted to build something in and we thought was at least in our current knowledge and ability to look forward the something that was in a reasonable bandwidth.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company", "Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful color. Two more quick ones and I will hop off. Just another one back on the fuel cost, I know the cost have been elevated for a couple of quarters now. I am just curious how quickly you can pass those through, I know it written in the contract, but is that something where\u2026 it\u2019s fairly immediate or you are going back one month to two months in a year, just any explanation on how that works?", "Richard T. Kogler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "We can react fairly quickly, but I think if you just think about it from the standpoint of lag, there will be a some lag and that\u2019s why in the past, we said that we are able to counter, but there could be as these fuel surcharges build into the revenue, there could be some margin impact\u2026 minimal, but you might see it.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company", "Okay. Great. And the last one, it looks like decent CapEx quarter kind of a run rate of $60 million, given the just under 15 you did this quarter. Was anything significant there on the returns or recall business or anything international that drove that to a little bit of an uptick in the quarter.", "Richard T. Kogler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Yes, I think I am not sure about the comment of $60 million\u2026 that maybe the run rate, but remember the CapEx is kind of lumpy. We are still holding to our guidance around 5% of revenues based on the new revenues and mid 40\u2019s will be our spend this year, because of acquisitions and because of strength of recall business, we make decisions to pull some projects forward because they had strong IR\u2019s.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company", "Okay. Perfect. Thanks for the color. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jonathan Ellis from Merrill Lynch.", "Jonathan Ellis - -Merrill Lynch", "Thanks good evening guys.", "Frank J.M. Ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer", "Good evening.", "Jonathan Ellis - -Merrill Lynch", "Wanted to just\u2026 in terms the \u201908 guidance, I wanted to\u2026 try to get some clarification what assumptions you are making in terms of SQ or LQ growth?", "Frank J.M. Ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer", "The SQ is about 8% to 10%. LQ internal growth about 5% to 7%, and you are looking at an international somewhere in 7% to 9%.", "Jonathan Ellis - -Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And it seems like the LQ growth is down just modestly from the range you provided previously.", "Frank J.M. Ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer", "A little bit, I mean you also get with Bio as a percent of the total, but overall, I mean it\u2019s still good revenues coming in.", "Jonathan Ellis - -Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then on the international business, I am wondering could you talk a little bit about the organic growth in that business this quarter versus international or versus acquired?", "Frank J.M. Ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer", "Well, in the quarter, we had 11.6% in growth and that is adjusted for the divestiture that we did and for foreign exchange. Foreign exchange in the quarter aided, if you compare to last year, about $3 million to the revenues.", "Jonathan Ellis - -Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And is that figure also adjusted though for acquisitions?", "Frank J.M. Ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer", "Yes, it is.", "Jonathan Ellis - -Merrill Lynch", "Okay, so that\u2019s a near organic number.", "Frank J.M. Ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer", "Yes.", "Jonathan Ellis - -Merrill Lynch", "And then also in terms of the company that you bought abroad, would you really tell us what country that was in?", "Frank J.M. Ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer", "That was in Canada.", "Jonathan Ellis - -Merrill Lynch", "Okay.", "Frank J.M. Ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer", "That\u2019s the one, that again, closed early October. It was kind of in the Canadian press.", "Jonathan Ellis - -Merrill Lynch", "Yes.", "Frank J.M. Ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer", "And we acquired from Brands and Brick [ph].", "Jonathan Ellis - -Merrill Lynch", "Great. I appreciate that. And then in terms of the STG integration, how far along are you at this point and when do you think you will be done, where the integration of that company?", "Frank J.M. Ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer", "Again, STG is\u2026 because of the size of it, takes longer and as we said before it would probably definitely still run into the first half of next year, both from a waste flow point of view and just the integration between the two.", "Jonathan Ellis - -Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then just finally, on the topic of U.K. Can you talk about mix of SQ versus LQ right now?", "Frank J.M. Ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer", "I think if you look, it\u2019s about little over 20% that right now is in the SQ in Europe. And then when we talk U.K., we have always talked about Ireland and U.K. together.", "Jonathan Ellis - -Merrill Lynch", "Yes. Okay. And then just one final question relates to share repurchase. It looks like this year, repurchase is up there quite a bit. Could you talk a little bit what your assumptions are going into next year in terms of repurchases?", "Frank J.M. Ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer", "Again in our guidance we don\u2019t presume repurchases. So, again, from a guidance, we don\u2019t make those predictions. Again, we are opportunistic in our repurchases and if we see opportunities we will take advantage of them.", "Jonathan Ellis - -Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.", "Frank J.M. Ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Leon Young from Citigroup.", "Unidentified Analyst - Citigroup", "Hi, it\u2019s actually Elena Cellura [ph] for Leon. Just getting back to the acquisitions. In the quarter there were two domestic acquisitions you made. Were they in the Med waste?", "Frank J.M. Ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer", "Yes, they were.", "Unidentified Analyst - Citigroup", "Okay. And how was the pipeline now? Has there been any change?", "Mark C. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, we are still\u2026 despite doing all the deals, we are still over $50 million in the North America marketplace.", "Unidentified Analyst - Citigroup", "Okay. And also margins, gross margin in the quarter was a little bit shy versus what we had expected and also sort of versus what you guys have said in the past for 30 basis points to 40 basis points of improvement quarter-over-quarter. Are you still expecting that kind of growth--?", "Mark C. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer", "If you look in the quarter, there\u2019s really three factors. We obviously from a revenue point of view were ahead of the expectations and that was both through due to acquisitions, International, there was a half opening growth as a result of foreign exchange. Those are normally come in at lower margins. Returns was also had a little bit rather the recall related, which is lower margins, if you blend all that, you really are going to come again to round to 45% gross margin. And if you really look ahead, I mean anywhere 15 to 20 basis points quarter-over-quarter from the next year point of view, but on the base, if you take all that kind of mix factors out, we were probably about 35 basis points up versus the prior quarter", "Unidentified Analyst - Citigroup", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Scott Levine from JP Morgan.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan", "Good Afternoon.", "Frank J.M. Ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer", "Good afternoon.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan", "Regarding the SG&A you don\u2019t give this final level of detail yet for 2008 but you guys have been stepping up the strategic spend this years. Any thought in terms of what the bias might be on the SG&A kind of going forward beyond this period is elevated strategic spend?", "Mark C. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think the current outlook in our preliminary guidance would be a key. Our SG&A levels comparable the kind of where we are running right now throughout Q4 and 2008. there is sill several programs that are under review that. I think they have great IR\u2019s that will maybe pull forward, but as we have seen in the past those who paid off nicely for us. We really accelerated the sales and marketing efforts and gotten the returns for. So, I think the most of the models depending on how you treat amortization and acquisition related costs, you are going to come in mid to high 18s.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan", "Got it. And then turning to acquisitions one follow-up. Any change in multiples you seeing out there and/or do you see any limit potentially in the domestic marketplace and what you can do with traditional rollout type opportunities?", "Mark C. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, again, on the deals that we closed and the one right after quarter multiples again, they are sixth and seventh on a synergized basis. So, very much in a range and on deals that are in the pipeline, no. we are, again, anticipating similar kind of picture.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan", "One last one on recalls. Are you guys contemplating or thinking there's any real additional investment necessary for you guys to grow the business beyond the warehouses you have, the technology infrastructure or are we pretty much done the heavy lifting there?", "Richard T. Kogler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "I think we will continue to support the businesses with whatever CapEx mates they have. Again, it\u2019s not huge CapEx, but I think for us really the drive on awareness on expansion and capabilities is why we are putting a lot of our SG&A and things right now. So, we are excited about the space, it will continues to be one that we believe we can get over time to north of 20% EBITDA margins and have a very unique set of tools for helping our customers, to help their customers.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan", "Do you have a sense\u2026 one last following. Do you have a sense with regard to the mix I know you don\u2019t breakout returns versus recall? But do you have a rough sense in terms of mix of returns versus recall? You ultimately expect to achiever or you not thinking about that way.", "Richard T. Kogler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "No, we don\u2019t really price it and think about the business in that regard.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan", "Very good. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Greg Halter from Great Lakes Review", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "Thank you for taking the time to answer the questions. Relative to share buyback with the stock prices 55 plus, just wondering your appetite I presume is still there to buy given what else you see out there. What is the highest price you have paid to-date for stock?", "Frank J.M. Ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer", "We don\u2019t give that specific detail. If you really look and recall of the last quarter, the average in the quarter at that point was about 48.22.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "Okay. And fuel costs, fuel and energy costs I should represented what percentage of your sales in the quarter?", "Frank J.M. Ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer", "It was about 5.7%.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "Basically about the same as last couple of quarters.", "Frank J.M. Ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer", "Correct", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "Okay And any commentary that you could provide relative to the pending acquisition of MedSolutions would be helpful. I think they are voted November 7, if I have that correct?", "Frank J.M. Ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer", "I think that\u2019s correct, I know that correct sorry. It's a tuck-in. It is a good transaction for us. It will have some what we would consider public company add backs. We have good operating company saving because of the fact that it\u2019s tuck-in. In a range of a normal multiple again from transaction that size, and again, from that point of view, we anticipated to close early November.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "And you envision taking any of their own proprietary businesses throughout your whole infrastructure, I think they have sort of onsite device possibly.", "Frank J.M. Ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer", "Again, everything comes with transaction. It will be evaluated to make money and case-by-case basis, we will look at it.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "All right. And I didn\u2019t hear the debt to EBITDA, do you have that figure, I appreciate it.", "Frank J.M. Ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer", "It\u2019s 1.99.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "And you are still comfortable going up to three times.", "Frank J.M. Ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer", "Yes.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "All ready. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question will be from Robert Willoughby from Banc of America.", "Unidentified Analyst - Banc of America", "Hello guys, this is Jason Fruechtel [ph] sitting in for Robert Willoughby. I miss your debt to cap picked up a bit. Should we expect that to continue to increase in the near term or--?", "Frank J.M. Ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer", "Again because of the repos, you are going to get an environment where debt to cap is probably not as good a indicator, I mean the debt that you picked out for us is a far better indicator for leverage ability and leverage kind of too high or low. 2.0 for us, the 1.99 we feel it\u2019s still on the conservative side. We are going to keep managing that, most likely we will be anywhere between one and a half, two and a half is a kind of normal bandwidth for us. Could we at times go a little lower to debt. Yes, depending on the transaction and historic if you look back our lowest has been about 1.2 so, no, we feel comfortable with it, I think debt to cap is probably not as good an indicator to use.", "Unidentified Analyst - Banc of America", "Okay, and just a question on your water management services that you provide. Could you discuss how many customers you had in the quarter and if you target a specific type of health care facility, I mean profit versus non-profit?", "Frank J.M. Ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer", "Yes, the water treatment program is still on pilot phase so there\u2019s no material impact to the quarter or material numbers don\u2019t enter our remaining \u201907 or \u201908 guidance so should we wall [ph] that out that would be upside but we are not anticipating anything at this point in time and our target base foe that type of service would be predominantly primary hospital market place or LQ market place so it would be applicable to nursing homes, essentially any place where you are going to have patients that are potentially immune compromised that are going to need cleaner water sources and water borne organisms.", "Unidentified Analyst - Banc of America", "Okay. Great, thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Cliff Walsh from Julius Baer.", "Cliff Walsh - Julius Baer", "Good afternoon.", "Frank J.M. Ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer", "Good afternoon.", "Cliff Walsh - Julius Baer", "Frank, you gave us a $50 million pipeline for North America. Is there an international number that you can share with us?", "Frank J.M. Ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer", "We don\u2019t disclose the international because it would be maybe too obvious as to what kind of transactions we would be looking at.", "Cliff Walsh - Julius Baer", "Okay. And in terms of recent acquisitions can you maybe comment on respective companies in terms of where they fit in terms of pricing, in the market we are talking about some of the lower priced competitors maybe that we can surprise improve over time in those markets?", "Frank J.M. Ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer", "Again I think, simple thing is it\u2019s post multiple 6 to 7 from a pricing point of view, it\u2019s very much in our bandwidth. They are tuck ins and sort of good transactions for us.", "Cliff Walsh - Julius Baer", "I wasn\u2019t talking about valuations, I was talking more specific pricing, customer pricing in the markets that where you are competing with these companies. Were they 10% below you in terms of price or 20% or maybe just comment on the ability to maybe raise the pricing in those small markets.", "Frank J.M. Ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer", "No, this market is so close together again that you will not see those kind of differences.", "Cliff Walsh - Julius Baer", "Okay. Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from CIBC World Markets.", "Scott Schneeberger - CIBC World Markets", "Hey guys, thanks for taking my call. Just a quick one. In this arbitration case going on in Australia and that has yet to be quantified as far as I am familiar. Can you provide enough date has that been quantified or are you still waiting on that. Any color on it?", "Frank J.M. Ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer", "No, it hasn\u2019t been quantified yet. It\u2019s our anticipation that there will probably be a pending Q4 kind of outcome probably in the latter part and\u2026 no. No quantification yet.", "Scott Schneeberger - CIBC World Markets", "Okay. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. I am sure no further questions at this time sir.", "Mark C. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We thank everybody for your time and attention. 2008 is going to be a great year and we appreciate all your support.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only-mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions on how to participate will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to introduce your host for the conference, Ms. Liz Brandel, Vice President of Finance.", "Liz Brandel - Vice President, Finance", "Thank you. Welcome to Stericycle's quarterly conference call. On today's call will be Frank Ten Brink, Chief Financial Officer, Rich Kogler, Chief Operating Officer and Mark Miller, Chief Executive Officer.", "I will now read the Safe Harbor statements. Statements by Stericycle on this conference call that are not strictly historical are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and should be viewed with caution. Factors described in the company form 10-K, 10-Q as well as it's other filings with the SEC could effect the company's actual results and could cause the company's actually results to differ materially from expected results.", "The company makes no commitment to disclose any revisions to forward-looking statements or any facts, events or circumstances after this date that may bear upon forward-looking statements. I'll now pass the call to Frank.", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "Thanks, Liz. The results for the first quarter are as follows: Revenues grew $43.7 million to $254.8 million, up 20.7% from $211 million in the first quarter of '07. Internal growth for the company was $23.9 million or 11.5% which is adjusted for the divestiture of some assets of STG in the first quarter of '07 and foreign exchange.", "Domestic growth was 11.4% and international growth, adjusted for exchange and divestiture was 11.6%. Domestic growth consisted of SQ up over 13% and LQ up 9%. Return's management revenues were $16.5 million in the quarter. Gross profit was a $113.6 million or 44.6% of revenues, and SG&A expense, including amortization, was $48 million or 18.9% of revenues.", "Operating income was $59.5 million or 23.3% of revenues, which included the charge of $5.4 million for the settlement of various business disputes with Daniels. Net interest expense was $7.7 million versus $7.3 million in 2007 due to increase borrowings related to acquisitions and repurchases of shares. GAAP net income was $31.7 million or $0.35 per share. Excluding the settlement charge, non-GAAP net income would have been $35 million or $0.39 per share.", "Now to balance sheet; at the end of the quarter, the revolver borrowings were approximately $495 million. On April 15 '08 we closed on a private placement of a $100 million and this note is a seven year term to expire in April of 2015 and has a fixed rate of 5.64%. The proceeds were used to repay revolver debt increasing our unused portion to approximately $310 million.", "We repurchased 1,000,482 shares... million shares of common stock in the open market in an amount of approximately $79.4 million. Cumulatively, we have repurchased approximately 10 million shares and we still have authorization to purchase an additional 3.3 million shares. Our capital spending was $11.3 million and our days sales outstanding were 59 days. The cash provided from operations in the quarter was $63.6 million, and I will now turn it over to Rich.", "Richard T. Kogler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Thanks, Frank. We want to thank each member of our worldwide team for their solid performance and continued commitment to our customers and shareholders. We enjoyed strong sales growth in all of our business segments in the quarter.", "The STG growth was primarily driven by Steri-Safe with over two thirds of new Steri-Safe customers choosing select and preferred. Steri-Safe contributed approximately 57% of total small customer revenues.", "LQ sales growth was driven by the continued option of our bio-systems offering and new LTG [ph] med waste contracts. In summary, we ended Q1 with approximately 397,200 accounts of which approximately 287,400 were small, and the remainder large, and I will turn it over to Mark", "Mark C. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Rich. I would now like to provide insight on our current outlook for 2008. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements.", "During the first quarter we completed two tuck-in acquisitions, one domestic and one international. The incremental revenue impact in the first quarter was approximately $1 million, and the annualized revenues of these two acquisitions is approximately $12 million.", "But keep in mind our guidance for the year does not include future acquisitions or divestitures or the settlement charge in the first quarter of approximately $0.04 per share. We believe that analysts EPS estimates will be in the range of $1.67 to $1.70 which we are comfortable with. We have had our assessments of revenues for 2008 will be in the range of approximately $1.05 billion to $1.07 billion depending on primary assumptions of growth and foreign exchange rates.", "We believe analysts will have estimates for net income between $148 million and $151 million depending upon assumptions for mix and interest expense. And also we believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow between $140 million and $145 million with capital expenditures anticipated between $45 million and $55 million. In closing, we are very excited about the tremendous growth in the first quarter and the rest of 2008 and beyond.", "We thank you for your time and we will now go to question and answer.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes to us from Ryan Daniels of William Blair & Company.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company", "Hi, good evening guys, just a couple of quick house keeping questions up front that we track. Can you give me the number of large quantity adds in bio-system adds during the period?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "Yes, the number of large quantity ads was 58 RMW and 70 Bio-systems.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company", "Okay, great, and do have the number of Steri-Safe accounts?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "Slightly... total number of Steri-Safe right now is a little bit over a 121,000.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company", "121, okay, great, then a couple of broader ones; first of, obviously the economic environment continues to be a big topic for a lot of companies and you continue to chuck through. But I guess one of the questions I had is, how much in particular of the small quantity generator business, if any is, going to be based on tonnage or volume? IE, if their and Dynamics [ph] officers are seeing lower demand, does that impact your revenue growth or do you contractually kind of have it set throughout the year so that's not a risk.", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "The small quantity customer base is typically priced on the service base on free...-particularly in Steri-Safe where there is a monthly or quarterly fee, they really isn't a penalty and also the volume dynamic really doesn't affect the revenues in our cost structures that much.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company", "Okay, so volatility there really isn't going to impact your outlook?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "No,and also you don't typically see much volatility even at Dynamics. Healthcare continues to have demand through all those economic cycles.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company", "True. Okay, then two more quick ones. I know, I ask this, probably every other quarter, but on the Water Treatment side, may be a bit of period end on that and it seems that's [ph] actually came out last week and said your legionnaires disease is now going to be treated as a never event. I know your Water Treatment technology can really help hospitals control that very effectively, is that something that might be that water show event that really takes that product or that service offering to the next level, could be a new growth avenue that we hear more about from you guys in the future?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "Yes, I think on the... the whole focus on the better outcome of Healthcare and affecting reimbursement levels based upon the actual results achieved, all of that focus on trend is good for us and I think it is more and more institutions report on their focus on how do they get the maximum reimbursement for activities, all areas that we operate, I think have benefited, whether it be reusable sharps programs or Med waste programs, other innovative programs that we have under R&D and pilot program. So, I think it's a fundamental churn. I think the CMS dynamics are still... are going to take time to evolve in terms of setting what will be the reimbursement and for people to understand the base lines when compared to that, that fundamental trend that it goes in our favor.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company", "Okay, great. And then, one final question, I noticed in your guidance, looks like everything is going up a little bit, maybe with the exception of net income on the high-end coming down. Is that just more interest expense because you have taken on more debt and repurchased some more stock?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "Yes, obviously with the repurchase of the shares of about 79 million, that's close obviously, that will increase the interest expense with debt a lower share count. So, really withholding the number about the same as before in the lower share count gets you the benefit.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company", "Got you. Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys.", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, our next question comes from Alina Cellura from Citi.", "Alina Cellura - Citigroup", "Hi, good evening. Just a quick question on fuel, I know previously you mentioned you have mentioned that fuel is pretty much recovered, but with the spike recently... I mean are you seeing any particular headwind at all, from the fuel spike?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "Well, Alina, obviously fuel is the challenge for us, but our contracts rule out passing through, there we've mentioned before that there is some lag effect between when, you actually put the surcharge in, when you recover it and when fuel is moving as rapidly as it's now, that can pose a challenge but I think we managed through it pretty effectively. The one thing we always like to remind people is because it is a pass through it can't have the storing [ph] effect and impact on both... a kind of both for revenue growth and sequential margins.", "Alina Cellura - Citigroup", "And also, can you just tell us where those two tuck-in acquisitions were, domestically and internationally?", "Mark C. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, the one was in the Pacific Northwest, and the other one was in Canada.", "Alina Cellura - Citigroup", "Canada, okay, and were they both med waste?", "Mark C. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, related, yes.", "Alina Cellura - Citigroup", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, our next question comes from Scott Levine from JP Morgan.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, this is Ronnie Toidine [ph], just... first of all, on the acquisition front, can you just talk a little bit about the pipeline which you are seeing there, how strong it may or may not be at this point, and maybe you could talk about any particular regions you might be interested in from a new market standpoint?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "Well, the pipeline remains robust, its north of 50 million for the North American markets. So despite us doing deals we keep being able to replenish it well. It's really, we look at it opportunistically. At a... region that would may be get more or less attention in that North American marketplace and we look for up and tuck-ins so it is not a specific one from that point of view.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, thanks, and secondly on the fuel, just kind of follow-up on that, what impact... can you quantify the impact that may had on your margins in the first quarter, and what it might do in the second quarter.", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "I think if you look in the first quarter from a percentage of gross margin, it was just naught basis points impact, so whereas before maybe we did 44.6% without the fuel, that clearly would have been closer to 44.8 and little bit up from there.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Got you, Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you, our next question comes from David Manthey from Robert W. Baird.", "David Manthey - Robert W. Baird", "Hi, good afternoon, on the last question Frank, did you say it was 20 basis points?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "Yes.", "David Manthey - Robert W. Baird", "Okay thank you. Could you talk about the number of telesales, direct sales and drivers that you currently have and what the growth rate you're seeing in those categories?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "We don't break it during the year out, you do get the details in the Ks, so go back to the K, and that detail as much as we are willing to give is right in there.", "David Manthey - Robert W. Baird", "Okay,thank you. And then, on ETD, could you talk about the advantage of using that method versus the incineration or other methods of treating medical waste? Is there a margin advantage there and could you talk about your capacity right now?", "Mark C. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, first on the treatment modalities, ETD versus incineration, ETD gives you the way to get in and be able to permit facilities and capacity because you are not going into a community with a proposition that says there is air emissions or water emissions. It's never easy to permit new capacity, but it does have some advantages of being able to pull forward there, and it also has the grind and compaction dynamics of the unrecognizability of reduction in volume, but it's not a meaningful dynamic in the overall cost structure.", "The cost of servicing customers is... the number one cost is transportation and logistics. On the second part and overall capacity, we are probably running little over 70% capacity utilization right now.", "David Manthey - Robert W. Baird", "Okay, and then final question in terms of potential new business, I have been reading a little about reuse of medical devices. Is there any possibility, you look at that as a new avenue going forward, is that not something you are interested in?", "Mark C. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, that's something we are aware of and keeping an eye on that but it's not something in our current list of to do's.", "David Manthey - Robert W. Baird", "Very well, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Thanks, good afternoon. Just a quick clarification on the gross margins, Frank, you mentioned about, its sounds like 20 basis points on fuel, and as you talked in the past you got 20 to 40 basis points quarterly, sequential improvement abs [ph] in things like fuel acquisition impact may be ForEx. Could you give us a bit more of the breakout on the sequential move in those pieces? Thanks.", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "I think if you again look in Q1, there is kind of two factors that impacted the margins, one is the as I said, the 20 basis points on the pass through and the other one which is little smaller, its kind of its mounting now, but five basis points above the acquisition related and those are really the two main impact factors in the quarter itself. If you look going forward, on the kind of steady state, you are looking at a 20 to 40 basis points and the thing that can throw that off again like it has in the past a little bit is obviously acquisitions, any international mix factors and then obviously if there is additional pass through, that would have an impact but on the steady state you are looking at 20 to 40 basis points from what it was this quarter.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Thanks, SG&A, a little bit better than what I had modeled, I think 18.4%... are we... on that line, did you cut cost in the quarter to a new level... basically are you spending at a new level and this is going to be the run rate kind of slowing down on certain things, picking up on certain things, I guess could you talk a little bit about the mix as the Bio-System, Steri-Safe return recalls, were you spend pushing down on the pedal or easing off. Thanks.", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "I think overall it is there's no specific things that are being cut, we keep feeding the hot hands obviously Steri-Safe, Bio-systems, new R&D there might be some projects in quarters if we like we said, if we run ahead in our earnings we do invest in projects, some of those might be one time R&D kind of things we may be doing. I wouldn't read too much into that, you are talking a little bit here in rounding overall. You also have some acquisitions and it depends, amortization, I don't know if you include that in it or not but that could also swing the number a little bit, we normally includes the transition expenses in SG&A, so if you have that in there that might, that was a little bit higher because of the larger deals we did in the fourth quarter. So those could be factors that could make it up and down a little bit, but not materiality.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Okay, thanks. Along those line, Steri-Safe, there's been talk of you getting more involved with an internet offering there, is that going to be much upfront cost, I imagine that would be attractive margins going forward, could you just take us through your initiatives there a little please?", "Mark C. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We have a Steri-Safe internet initiative that's already in place, we will join that up. Big move on the cost side, as something is time goes on and we have some accounts that are migrating to that. It's really based on the infrastructure that's in place in the practice office, so we have the full gamut of service offering, but that just one of the overall strategy.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Okay, thanks and then finally, coming up against a tough returns recall comp in the second quarter, I think it was in the ball park of 25 million last year, again do you have anything to think about going forward as far as a how those are going to add to the flow?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "No, I thing if you look overall our guidance was 70 million to 85 million and that still is, we feel comfortable with. Q1 last year was a little bit lower but I wouldn't read too much into it. I mean you are looking at kind of an industry a little bit because that bumpiness has some variance. It is growing, there's certainly more awareness that we are creating and there is more media attention as you read in the newspaper and the like. So I think all those positive factors are kind of good back winds for us for the long run.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Okay, thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you, [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Jonathan Ellis of Merrill Lynch.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, good evening guys. Just a quick question on Steri-Safe could you provide the percentage of total account that are on the high levels as of the end of the first quarter?", "Mark C. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, right now, we're about 25% of total accounts on the premium select.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Thank you. And the LTG and STG growth for the quarter, would you be able to derive what portion of that in basis points was the function of fuel surcharges?", "Mark C. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think if we overall look your talking a couple of percentage points.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "So both on STG and LTG?", "Mark C. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, it's not materially different.", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "We don't really work it out and it's very hard in the quarter to sit down say well exactly this much was fuel surcharge. In general, we believe it's the 1 to 2% range.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, I know it's helpful. And just as to be clear, my understanding is more of your SQ customer or surcharge eligible versus your LQ customer is that in fact the case?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "I don't think that's how [ph] it indicates our contract provides flexibility because we been able to manage through it now for several years that we have had higher fuel. I think that really one of the issue might be timing, the large quantity contracts sometimes have notification periods and whatever but we have flexibilities.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, and just on fees and general, are there any other... any other fees other than fuel surcharges that you kind of implement your contract that can scale up overtime that offset perhaps inflationary pressure in the business?", "Mark C. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Not direct, we obviously have specific charges relating to environmental or regulatory, yes, those would be able to passed on, sometimes there are taxes been added by states, obviously those are straight pass ons, those are the kinds.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, all right. Great, and on the acquisition front, you mentioned that the pipeline in North America is... remains very consistent about $50 million. I am curious, are you giving a sense that there maybe [indiscernible] lease from fibre rayon [ph] companies that become increasingly willing to come to the bargaining table, given the prospect that capital gains tax rules may change the next illustration [ph]. Do you think the sense is more interested in essentially during deals?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "I think in the discussions we have had with people doing deals over the last year or two yes that has always been part of the discussion for them, how to structure thinks. So I would say yes there is a sensitivity on the side of sellers to that issue. Yes.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. And then just on the SG&A side. Just to clarify one of your answers to the previous question, is... should the expectation still be that SG&A for the year is in the high 18% range or is it 19%?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "Correct.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, and the extent that you can just characterize this maybe qualitatively, would you say that more of your spending this year is focused on enhancing existing programs or as you mentioned, R&D your new programs. Just take in the relative sense of where SG&A is being allocated?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "I think overall, obviously in total dollar spent we spent more on current, but I would say from an incremental, there is definitely a focus on R&D and looking for new opportunities and if we do get ahead of ourselves as we've said always, that's when we would look for additional invest and pulling project out.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. And then just finally the resolution with the arbitration proceedings in the U.K., does this make it easier in any way either legally or structurally to launch a biosystems program in the U.K.?", "Mark C. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer", "The settlement of the really the joint venture really wasn't working for either party and both of us agreed to go on our own way. It's kind of a few elements were the cause of the fence and distraction element, the debenture was just annex subset of geographic area that might grow. So overall taking an analysis on Bio-system's in international markets has a tension [ph] consistent as we said in said prior calls, its really... think about a phase II, most priority is focus on acquisitions integration, building the small platform and launching additional programs on to that as we move through times so there is no see.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, and just one last question against if I can squeeze in, the percentage of accounts in U.K. that are not SQ versus LQ?", "Mark C. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We were in the... SQ was in the low 20's, right for SQ and that's a percent of total revenue.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great, thank you guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operators Instruction]. Our next question is from Greg Halter of Great Lakes Review.", "Greg Halter - Great LakesReview", "Good afternoon guys", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "Good afternoon", "Greg Halter - Great LakesReview", "Noticed that your receivable is up about 31% on a year-over-year basis, just wondering why that is?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "Well, it's heavily, heavily acquisition driven, obviously with the acquisition and there is a lot of activity, DSO was at year end 58, this quarter 59. We were up just because of the one day and then the rest was really acquisitions, but the majority of this increase year-over-year is acquisition related.", "Greg Halter - Great LakesReview", "Okay. And do you have a figure for what fuel cost as a percentage of revenues in the quarter?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "Total energy, which is fuel and energy was 6.65 of revenue.", "Greg Halter - Great LakesReview", "Which I think is up from 6.1 in the previous quarter?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "That is correct.", "Greg Halter - Great LakesReview", "Okay and looking at your market share, any potential that you have there and I know you have been talking about this $10 billion number is the total market. Do you see any changes in your status positions or competitors or size of market, and I guess that would be a worldwide question.", "Mark C. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think one thing we are seeing is continued expansion of the market, we see as people age of access to Healthcare, there is this continuous steady demand, we saw that in the... with nice growth in the first quarter that was coming through in volume. So I think this is just a fundamental expansion of service. Obviously the size of the market expands as we add new services to the program and we keep enhancing our service offering. I think it's still a very, very competitive market but we believe longer term because of the size and scale and keep innovating and advancing that we can continue to change the game and have a competitive advantage by just having rapid service for our customers.", "Greg Halter - Great LakesReview", "Okay and giving your large market shares do you run into any trouble with FTC when you look at or make acquisitions?", "Mark C. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Now, I'm not sure how you define on the market shares, but we don't think we are getting anywhere close to those levels, but from our stand point we roughly about 9% of the global opportunity and so it a hasn't been issue from an FTC stand point.", "Greg Halter - Great LakesReview", "Okay, Excellent, and Frank on debt to EBITDA basis, where do you stand currently?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "At the end of the quarter we were at two points... little over 2.2, which roughly was about the same, we were at 2.16 and we were at 2.22 at the end of this quarter.", "Greg Halter - Great LakesReview", "Okay and I think you said you can go up to as much as three times, I believe?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "Yes, I think it's again a range, we feel very comfortable between two and three. I thing if we go to three it will be normally for a shorter period but our overall loan allows us to go to 3.75, that is the covenant that we have in both the senior and now the private placement so we have the room. And again if you look at history, if we don't do any repurchases or acquisition in the quarter, we come easily down 30 bips and... in a quarter. So, deleveraged very fast and so from that I get is an opportunity.", "Greg Halter - Great LakesReview", "And I think you had mentioned and I may have missed it, you know have 310 million available or used on the revolver after you did the 100 million note?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "That is correct, the note was used to reduce that and that is what is available right now.", "Greg Halter - Great LakesReview", "Okay, and here where I sit in Cleveland they are having a concern over pharmaceutical being flushed down the toilet and so forth contaminating the water and the city will an enacting or having a drop off, I guess you will on May 7th for any unused or expired pharmaceutical pills whatever, is that an area that your involved in now or could be involved in or just something that could happened throughout the country or is just not on event?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "No, I think it's something we're seeing across the country and more and more focused on it, and it's not just the U.S., it's a global issued, we're finding trace elements in water systems, residual chemicals and again most water treatment systems weren't designed to take a chemical entities out of the water, they are design to disinfected to a reasonable level. It does fit it into our service offering as you may, may not know through our REIT [ph] calls and returns management offering to our hospital and service programs we have a number of capabilities to help hospital and pharmacies be able to segregate appropriately waste and programs that we also do in connection with communities. To help properly segregate that material, contain it and destroyed it in an appropriate manner. Some of the leading institutions that are really trying to focus on their impact on the environment, their safety and regulatory compliance have found great value in our programs. So, I think this external awareness will just help move that further so it's a little of [indiscernible] but we are seeing, much more increase awareness of those topic.", "Greg Halter - Great LakesReview", "Okay that's great to hear thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you, [Operators Instruction]. I am showing no other questions from the phone lines.", "Mark C. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we thank everybody for your time and just in closing as a reminder of everyone of the administrative, professional recognition week, I hope all of you take the time to recognize those people that make it happen for you. And I would like to say on behalf of the entire Stericycle team, we want to thank [indiscernible] for all of the outstanding support that she does for us, day in and day out. Keep the company running and keep us on track. So thank you, [indiscernible]. Take care, everyone.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the second quarter 2008 Stericycle earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Liz Brandel, VP of Finance. Ma'am, you may begin your conference.", "Elizabeth Brandel - Vice President of Finance", "Thank you very much. Welcome to Stericycle's Quarterly Conference Call. On today's call will be Frank ten Brink, Chief Financial Officer; Rich Kogler, Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Miller, Chief Executive Officer.", "I will now read the Safe Harbor statement. Statements by Stericycle on this conference call that are not strictly historical are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, and should be viewed with caution. Factors described in the company's Form 10-K, 10-Qs, as well as its other filings with the SEC could affect the company's actual results and could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from expected results. The company makes no commitment to disclose any revisions to forward-looking statements or any facts, events or circumstances after this date that may bear upon forward-looking statements.", "I will now pass the call to Frank.", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "Thanks Liz. The results for the second quarter are as follows. Revenues grew $44.9 million to $277.8 million, up 19.3% from $232.8 million in the second quarter of '07. Internal growth for the company was $27 million, or 11.7%, which is adjusted for foreign exchange. Domestic growth was over 10%, and international growth adjusted for exchange was 17.5%. Domestic growth consisted of SQ up approximately 12% and LQ up approximately 8%.", "The returns management revenues were $26 million. Gross profit was $123.2 million, or 44.3% of revenues, and SG&A expense including amortization was $51.8 million or 18.6% of revenues. Operating income was $70.9 million, or 25.5% of revenues and interest expense was $8 million. Net income was $38.7 million or $0.44 per share.", "At the end of the quarter, the revolver borrowings were approximately $436 million. As previously disclosed on the first quarter call, on April 15th, we closed a private placement note of $100 million with a seven year term and a fixed rate of 5.64%. The unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of this quarter was approximately $245 million.", "In the quarter, we purchased 984,533 shares of common stock on the open market in an amount of approximately $51.7 million. Cumulatively, we have purchased approximately 11 million shares and we still have authorization to purchase an additional 5.2 million shares.", "Our CapEx was $11.7 million in the quarter and our DSO was 56 days. The cash provided from operations was $31 million for the quarter and $94.6 million year to date.", "And with that, I will turn it over to Rich.", "Richard T. Kogler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Thanks Frank. We want to thank each member of our worldwide team for their solid performance and continued commitment to our customers and shareholders. In the quarter we enjoyed strong sales growth in all of our business segments. The SQG growth was primarily driven by Steri-Safe, with three out of four new Steri-Safe customers choosing select and preferred. Steri-Safe contributed over 59% of total small customer revenues. LQ sales growth was driven by the continued adoption of our Bio Systems offering and new LQG med waste contracts.", "In summary, we ended Q2 with approximately 402,900 accounts, of which approximately 392,900 were small and the remainder large.", "Now let's turn it over to Mark.", "Mark C. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Rich. I would now like to provide insight on our current outlook for 2008. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements. During the second quarter, we completed three acquisitions, two domestic and one international. Incremental revenue impact in Q2 of 2008 was approximately $2.8 million, and the annualized revenues of these acquisitions is approximately $17 million.", "Please keep in mind our guidance does not include future acquisitions or divestitures, or the settlement charge of $0.04 per share reported in the first quarter. We believe that the analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $1.70 to $1.74, which we are comfortable with. Depending on their assumptions, we believe analysts' estimates for revenue for 2008 will be in the range of $1.08 billion to $1.096 billion. We believe analysts will have estimates for net income between $150 million and $154 million, depending on assumptions for mix and interest expense. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow of approximately $150 million, with capital expenditures anticipated between $45 million and $50 million for the year.", "In closing, we're very excited about the tremendous growth opportunities in 2008 and beyond. We thank you for your time, and operator, we will now open up to Q&A.", "QUESTION AND ANSWER", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels, of William Blair. Go ahead, your line is open.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "Thank you and good afternoon, guys, and congrats on another solid quarter. A couple quick housekeeping items upfront. Can you give us the number of Large Quantity adds and Bio Systems adds? And then the second part of that is the current number of Steri-Safe accounts and the percentage now on Premium?", "Richard T. Kogler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Yes, I can give you those numbers. The number of Bio Systems closes was 73 new accounts, 58 new med waste accounts. Turning to Steri-Safe, we have 125,000 customers on Steri-Safe right now. And your last question was --?", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "What percentage of those on Premium. I think it was about 25% last quarter?", "Richard T. Kogler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "We're currently at 26.5%, closing in on 27%.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "Okay, great. And then given the continued attention we've seen on energy costs, can you give us an update on what that was as a percent of revenue? And I'm also curious when you guys think of energy costs, is the biggest component there diesel for you for the trucks, or is it more on the gasoline side?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "The total energy as a percent of revenue was 7.56% in the quarter. And the larger portion of that is fuel for the trucks.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "Okay, so was there any push-back or any delay, I know diesel for trucks, it seems like this quarter, the second quarter was probably the quickest increase we've seen by some magnitude over the last few years. Were you guys able to successfully pass that through, or will we see some of the ramifications from those price increases spilling into the third quarter, given how quickly they happened?", "Richard T. Kogler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Our goal traditionally has always been to recover the energy costs, and we do that through pass-throughs because our contracts allow for that sort of thing. As we've said before, there is some lag effect and obviously when you have a quarter like Q2, where prices spike pretty dramatically, the lag effect is something that is challenging for us.", "But what our team delivered and the one thing that we always like to remind people is when you're doing pass-throughs of fuel and energy, which is sort of dollar for dollar, there is an impact on comparability of sales growth and obviously gross margin.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "Sure. Do you have an idea at least, Frank, what that contributed to sales growth in the period?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "I think from a sales growth, probably about 1% to 2%.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "Okay, so look pretty similar. And then last question I had, maybe you could give us an update on some of the international operations. It sounds like great growth there, maybe anything driving that in particular, whether it's new sales or if you're launching some new subsidiaries? Any update you might have on the Asian markets for us? Thanks.", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "There was strong growth throughout all the locations. There were some onetime revenues, probably the equivalent of maybe 3% to 4% of that growth; so it was $17 million; 3% to 4% of that was kind of onetime. The volumes are strong and it's been a good market.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of David Manthey, from Robert Baird. Go ahead, your line is open.", "David Manthey - Robert Baird", "Thank you. Maybe Frank, if you could talk about the impact of higher fuel prices on gross profit. I guess it might be -- it might have an impact there, I think you said it was 20 basis points last quarter. Could you talk about that?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "If the things would have been constant during the quarter from a fuel point of view, which it obviously wasn't, we would have been probably about 60 basis points better on the gross margin line.", "David Manthey - Robert Baird", "Okay. And then of the 402,900 customers, could you break that out by US versus international? And I don't know if you can talk about Small Quantity versus Large Quantity international?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "No, we don't break that out.", "David Manthey - Robert Baird", "Okay, and then on the returns management side, the $26 million, a real solid number there. Is there any chance that you're thinking about updating the level that you plan on seeing for this year?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "I think the guidance for this year probably is going to be in a range of $76 million to $87 million.", "David Manthey - Robert Baird", "Great, all right, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger, from Oppenheimer. Go ahead, your line is open.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Thank you. Just following up on that last question, a very strong number for returns recalls. Could you just take us a little bit deeper as to, are you seeing more volume of recalls or are you getting bigger jobs per recall? Any further color there, that would be great.", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "Yes, I think it was a very strong recall quarter, as I've mentioned over the times. The key to recalls is what I would call the quality of the recalls. So it really depends heavily on how deep we have to go for the respective customer, is it a recall all the way to the consumer level or not, what kind of services the customer is going to use from us and obviously over the years we have added services now to the whole portfolio. And all those engines were very strong in the quarter and so from that point, great.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Within SG&A spend, it was certainly, it came in below what I had been expecting. But it had been trending fairly high the last few quarters, in my view. Are we seeing, is it just some scale on the revenue? Are you tapering back on spending? And are you shifting where that spend is?", "I got the sense last year there was a big ramp in spend for returns management and now maybe that had shifted more to Steri-Safe and Bio Systems. Just any deeper commentary there.", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "I think obviously, if you have a quarter where also we had very strong returns revenue, the pass-throughed incremental SG&A that we for instance get on that is obviously not equivalent in percentage, so you do get a little bit of a benefit as a percent to revenue coming through to us.", "And again, the higher volume, the higher revenues, we had at that point not passed as much on, not much good flow-through for those. We are continuously looking for making strong investments for the future, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to do R&D and the new products and the like.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Thanks. Now, in the press release, a brief press release, but I believe something new, and I may be wrong, I didn't check back. You noted international investment as a use of cash. Anything new or interesting that you're doing on the international front, beyond acquisitions, just with the investment dollars?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "No, it's obviously, international investment means to us also that we are investing in now a larger portion of our business internationally, either through the capital spending and the like, it is mostly in that category and acquisitions.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Thanks very much. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Levine, from JPMorgan. Go ahead, your line is open", "Scott Levine - JPMorgan", "Good afternoon, guys.", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "Good afternoon.", "Scott Levine - JPMorgan", "With regard to the higher earnings guidance here, is that flow-through of acquisitions may be some of these onetime international revenues, is there anything else in terms of the assumptions that is coming up to drive that beyond those two items?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "No. Again, the guidance that we're giving is again excluding the $0.04, so that's important. But the second quarter, for most we were kind of beating by $0.02 and then for the next two quarters, kind of $0.01 each, so $0.04 up roughly.", "Scott Levine - JPMorgan", "And then on the acquisitions side, could you characterize the pipeline, do you have a sense that things maybe kind of pick up from here and, or is it kind of business as usual on a continuous of what you've seen?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "Strong pipeline, definitely over $50 million. It's a busy market out there.", "Scott Levine - JPMorgan", "Okay. Any change in the developmental programs? You guys are working the R&D pipeline, anything appreciable there?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "No, not specific. As we mentioned before, we continue to explore the pharmaceutical waste and that's becoming a part of some of the areas of the offerings in the LQ space and that seems to be positive as a direction.", "Scott Levine - JPMorgan", "One last one then on diesel. Do you see any sensitivity on the part of either LQ or SQ customers to pass-throughs? I know it's contractual by and large. But is there any sensitivity in terms of the recovery that you see, if fuel price [inaudible] to move up where at a certain point you might start getting some pushback or there might be less recovery on that side?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "We have not seen that so far and I think we're all sort of downstream from this fuel issue. I'm sure when you go buy groceries, you realize that there is cost of the fuel involved in transporting the goods to your store, and you pay it and you recognize it and you're trying to manage through it.", "Our customers understand the economic situation and our contracts are flexible. I think that we've done a good job of managing through it so far.", "Scott Levine - JPMorgan", "Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Leone Young, of Citi. Go ahead, your line is open.", "Alina Cellura - Citi", "It's actually Alina Cellura for Leone. Just a couple of little housekeeping questions, just curious what your cost of debt is right now?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "I'd say we're at about LIBOR plus anywhere like 85 on our general domestic borrowings. Internationally, they could be a little bit more.", "Alina Cellura - Citi", "Okay, and then the tax rate was a little bit lower than what I had expected. Are you expecting to get back up to around 38.5%?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "I would say for the year at 38.3% is a fair number to use.", "Alina Cellura - Citi", "Okay. And then just the acquisitions that you made in the quarter, were they in the core med waste business, or can you just talk a little bit about those?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "Yes, they were two domestic and one international. All were in the med waste area.", "Alina Cellura - Citi", "Okay, great and is acquisition activity or discussions, are they picking up because of the potential change in administration in January and the potential for higher capital gains taxes? Are you seeing a pickup in activity?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "I think in general, family businesses and owners don't start the discussion based on that. But once they get advice from their accountants and lawyers, they maybe will try to speed up the process. I haven't seen anything specific, however, that people come to the table faster or slower.", "Alina Cellura - Citi", "Okay, all right, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ellis, of Merrill Lynch. Go ahead, your line is open.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. Good evening, guys. Just, which country did you make that international acquisition this quarter?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "That was in Chile.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Chile. Okay. And correct me if I'm wrong, that is a new market for you, given that I think the only the only wholly-owned subsidiary you had down there previously was in Argentina?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "That's correct, yes.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "And should I assume that Chile, does that have similar characteristics in terms of market structure as Argentina?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "Yes, it does.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. And just in the UK, can you update us on where the mix of Large Quantity versus Small Quantity stands?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "It's right now the Small Quantity is in the low 20s.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "And is there any reason structurally in that market why the mix of Small Quantity versus Large Quantity couldn't over time, eventually get to where it is in the United States?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "No, it definitely has that potential to go up and reach what's in the United States. Structure in the market a little bit different with national health but there is still a lot of small providers under those structures and they really operate separately. It's kind of too early, but it looks like that that has potential.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, And can you just update us on, in the UK, the integration of STG, where that stands now, and if it's not completed when do you think you'll have that asset base fully integrated?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "As everyone knows, it was last year that we finished the process with the competition commission and kind of said it would take us roughly a year to do the integration. And I would say in the third quarter, early fourth quarter is when the majority of that is completed.", "There will always be opportunities with large customers and the like to keep looking for margin expansion as we've done in the US, etcetera. But that's kind of an ongoing improvement process.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. And just one other question on the international market, did you engage in any new joint ventures or licensing agreements this quarter?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "No.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "No. Okay, great. Just quickly on SG&A, previously, you had indicated that for the full year, SG&A would be probably anywhere in the 18.5% to 19% range, given the spending level for the first half of the year. Do you still feel comfortable with that range for the full year?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "Yes, I think for the range is still in the high 18s is what we gave as a guidance and we would like to hold to that.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then my final question from a cash flow standpoint, it seems like working capital in the second quarter tends to be a drag. It certainly was in the second quarter 2008. Why is that? Why do you typically find a working capital drag in the second quarter of each year? What's the seasonality behind that?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "It's really the taxes. In the second quarter, you pay first and second quarter income taxes. So, kind of as a macro, we probably paid about $27 million to $28 million taxes in Q2 versus cash taxes of about $14 million in Q1 and that's worldwide, roughly.", "The other thing is, in Q2, we had the payment of the settlement with Daniels and that negatively impacted probably by about $4 million to $5 million the kind of cash from ops in what you would call the working capital side of the business.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great, thanks, guys.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Anton Kawalsky, from Canyon Capital. Go ahead, your line is open.", "Anton Kawalsky - Canyon Capital", "Have you guys seen any changes at all in the competitive landscape? Do you see any of the big waste companies trying to enter the market, or has anything changed at all?", "Mark C. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I think it on the change, we haven't seen any dramatic change in impact from the market. There is interesting things evolving in the domestic solid waste market, where there is several companies in discussions in play of combination.", "I think from our point of view, it's still early in that consolidation, but it feels like regardless of the outcome, whether you're part of an acquirer or the acquired or merger or you're one of the parties that doesn't succeed, you're going to be pretty focused on what's happening with that acquisition and integration.", "And the focus rightfully so will be on the core solid waste business. So, I think it won't bode well for those organizations to put a lot of priority behind this particular space.", "Anton Kawalsky - Canyon Capital", "And so is it fair to say that the acquisition multiples that you've been paying, are they still 3 to 7 times EBITDA, or have they gone up?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "No, they have been very stable. Again, 3 to 7 is a good range for synergized kind of multiples.", "Anton Kawalsky - Canyon Capital", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby, from Banc of America. Go ahead, your line is open.", "Robert Willoughby - Banc of America Securities", "Questions were actually answered, thank you. Very nice quarter.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Peter Bates, from T. Rowe Price. Go ahead, your line is open.", "Peter Bates - T. Rowe Price", "Hi, guys, what's the mix of sales in the quarter, domestic versus international and with your guidance range that you gave of $1.8 billion to $1.96 billion, what's the expectation for the split there, international, domestic?", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "I think the split right now is about 24% in the international side, it was $66.8 million on [inaudible] on the US side. I think it really depends on acquisitions a little bit, that probably could change that number in the future. Again, we don't include any of that in our guidance and so that will drive it.", "The business keeps growing as is, as we said, SQ growing at 9% to 11%. The overall international is growing a little faster right now, for the year, probably about 10% to 11% internal. So it shouldn't not dramatically change, maybe go 24% or 25%.", "Peter Bates - T. Rowe Price", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "And at this time sir, there are no more questions in queue.", "Mark C. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we thank everybody for your time. And we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Everybody be safe. Take care.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

(NASDAQ:SRCL) Q1 2009 Earnings Call April 28, 2009  5:00 PM ET", "Executives", "Frank J.M. ten Brink - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer", "Richard T. Kogler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Mark C. Miller - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Analysts", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "Dave Manthey - BAIRD", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan", "Greg Halter - Soleil Group", "Chris Sessing - AMI Asset Management", "Operator", "Good afternoon. My name is Barbara, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome every one to the Stericycle First Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute, to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Frank ten Brink, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.", "Frank J.M. ten Brink", "Thank you. Welcome to Stericycle's quarterly conference call. Joining me on today's call will be Rich Kogler, COO, and Mark Miller, CEO.", "I will now read the Safe Harbor statement. Statements by Stericycle in this conference call that are not strictly historical are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, and should be viewed with caution. Factors described in the company's Form 10-K, 10-Q, as well as its other filings with the SEC, could affect the company's actual results, and could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from expected results.", "The company makes no commitment to disclose any revisions to forward-looking statements or any facts, events or circumstances after this date that may bear upon forward-looking statements.", "With that, now, the results. The results for the first quarter are as follows. Revenues grew 22.3 million to 274.1 million, up 8.8% from 254.8 million in the first quarter of '08. Revenues grew 15.1%, when adjusted for the unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 16.1 million.", "Domestic internal growth, excluding returns management was up 8.4%, and international internal growth, adjusted for exchange, was 9.8%. Domestic internal growth consisted of small quantity up 10%, and large quantity up 6%.", "The returns management revenues were 19.7 million in the quarter.", "Gross profit was a 127.8 million or 46.1% of revenues, and SG&A expense, including amortization, was 52.9 million or 19.1% of revenues.", "Net interest expense was 7.9 million, and net income was 40.7 million or $0.47 per share. At the end of the quarter, the revolver borrowings were approximately 420 million. 225 million of our revolver is hedged at an average fix of 2.81% LIBOR rate, plus 75 basis points. The remaining 195 million is floating at LIBOR plus 75 basis points, or the prime rate, whichever is lower. The unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately 222 million.", "We repurchased 536,346 shares of common stock on the open market at an amount of approximately 25.5 million in the quarter. And cumulatively, we've now purchased approximately 12.2 million shares, and we still have authorization to purchase an additional 4 million shares.", "The CapEx in the quarter was 8.4 million, and our DSO was 53 days. The cash provided from operations was $76 million for the quarter. And I will now turn it over to Rich.", "Richard T. Kogler", "Thanks Frank. We want to thank each member of our worldwide team for the solid performance and continued commitment to our customers and shareholders.", "In the quarter, we enjoyed strong sales growth in all of our business segments. The SQG growth was primarily driven by Steri-Safe, with three out of four of new Steri-Safe customers choosing select and preferred.", "Steri-Safe contributed over 64% of total small customer revenues. LQ sales growth was driven by the continued adoption of our Bio Systems offering and new LQG med waste contracts.", "In summary, we ended Q4 with over 420,000 accounts, of which over 410,000 were small, and the remainder large. And now, I will turn it over to Mark.", "Mark C. Miller", "Thanks Rich. I would now like to provide an insight on our current outlook for 2009. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements.", "At the end of the first quarter, we completed three domestic acquisitions. In addition, we close on the UK Cliniserve acquisition in April. The annualized revenues of these four acquisitions is approximately $17 million.", "Now keep in mind our guidance does not include future acquisitions or divestitures and related costs, which will be expensed as a result of the new FASB 141R. We believe that the analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $2.01 to $2.06, which we are comfortable with.", "We believe analyst revenue estimates will be in the range of 1.16 to 1.18 billion, depending on the assumptions for growth and foreign exchange. And we believe analysts will have estimates for net income between 175 and a 179 million, depending on assumptions on margin improvement and interest expense.", "Analysts will have estimates for free cash flow of between 180 and 187 million, with CapEx anticipated between 50 and 55 million.", "In closing, we are very excited about the tremendous growth opportunities in 2009 and beyond. We thank you for your time. And we'll now open it up to question and answer.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels of William Blair.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "William Blair:} Yeah guys. Good afternoon. Mark, a quick follow-up on the Cliniserve deal. I understand that, that didn't close until the second quarter. But, it sounds like that is part of the 17 million annual acquired revenue, and therefore in your guidance, is that fair?", "Mark Miller", "That is correct.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "Okay, perfect. And then, maybe a couple of bigger picture ones. I know recently, you have discussed adding a bit more resources on the M&A front. You've had a few active quarters. And I am curious, if you could provide a little more color there, is it more opportunities, new market potential, new offerings that you're targeting, any color there around the M&A outlook would be great?", "Frank Brink", "No, the pipeline remains very robust. We have definitely over 50 million into pipeline, despite having done those deals. And good domestic, and that's again a number for the North American market. But internationally it's active. So overall, we are very energized, and the team is doing a great job.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "Okay, great. And maybe now that we're sitting four months into the year, I am just curious if you guys could comment on reluctance that you're seeing with the customer base about switching to Steri-Safe or converting up service levels, anything like that with the macro issues. Certainly, it doesn't look to be the case in the numbers. But, any color there?", "Richard Kogler", "I think I can address that. I think the sales team is performing well. And as you said, it shows in the numbers. The offerings, I think, are very still very attractive, in terms of giving value to the customers. And that's why we still have a very high customer convergence to the premium and select levels, as well as many of the new customers are going right into those levels as I indicated in my prepared remarks.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "Sure. And then, a few things for our model, can you actually give us the Steri-Safe clients and the percent on premium. And then, just the LQG business, the adds for Bio Systems and waste management?", "Mark Miller", "Right now the total number of Steri-Safe customers is over a 135,000. And the percent on the premium levels is 30.4%. The LQ adds for the quarter were 56 or 58, pardon me, LQG contracts and 74 Bio Systems contracts.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "Okay, great. And then, maybe one last, quick one just on FX. If we think about the forward-looking guidance, are you guys assuming a specific, I am sure you are a dollar-to-pound, are you kind of modeling $1.40, if you will? Just to get a feel for how revenue could fluctuate based on where the dollar goes?", "Frank Brink", "I think if you look right now, the forecast would not for us assume any major change versus the last guidance and the exchange rates we used at that time.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "Okay. So, pretty similar. Great. Thanks a lot guys.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of David Manthey of Robert W. Baird.", "Dave Manthey - BAIRD", "Hi guys, good afternoon. Could you tell us, is $0.5 million about what we should expect for acquisition-related expenses going forward?", "Frank Brink", "I think that surely will depend on quarter-to-quarter. We don't include it in guidance. And in comparison to prior periods and prior years, we kind of from a point of view, excluded in comparing ourselves, because previously, as we all know, it was capitalized into the transaction. But again, it will vary from quarter-to-quarter. And it's difficult to predict.", "Dave Manthey - BAIRD", "Okay. And in terms of that variability Frank, when you were talking from 0.5 million to 2 million, or were you talking from 0.5 million to 6 or 700,000?", "Frank Brink", "Again, depends on deal volume. And so, it really depends. It's tough for me to put a number to that. It won't be 10 million, I can tell you that. But, it will certainly be commensurate with the transaction sizes that we're doing.", "Dave Manthey - BAIRD", "Okay. And second, is there any impact from more aggressive EPA, either positive or negative, on your business?", "Mark Miller", "I think the EPA effect is positive, as we continue to see more focus on trying to look at segregation of materials is topping our returns. And pharma services that the pilots were doing. I think the longer term affect of the change in EPA rates and incineration which will be several years out will have a favorable effect. So, and I think, those would be longer term activities.", "Dave Manthey - BAIRD", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", ": Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess, if we could start out back on the acquisitions, could you guys break out magnitude of Cliniserve, or just kind of degree of magnitude within the four there?", "Frank Brink", "I think if you look at the annualized 17 million, you're probably somewhere between the 15 and 16, somewhere in that range, depending on exchange rate for Cliniserve.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Okay. That makes the other three fairly small. Could you give us a little more detail on those geographical in size?", "Frank Brink", "Within the U.S. predominantly, let's see one was west, two very pretty much east. But, they were small deals, no doubt. The larger one was Cliniserve.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Okay. So, those other three were all SQGs then?", "Frank Brink", "They were predominantly SQG area. And at least more than half was SQG of there revenues. Yes.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Okay, thanks. Could you speak to the just the environment for waste volumes at your hospital customers? Your numbers are holding up well, but just what's your -- what you are seeing there?", "Richard Kogler", "What we're seeing right now is that the volumes are holding pretty well. So, I think it's also important to remember that there over 80% of our business is really not volume driven. So, we haven't seen material effect. I mean, we do see some minor effects. I mean, a small dentist office may be closing, or something like that. But that really isn't material. And so, that's why I am pretty comfortable in saying right now that our business has not been significantly affected.", "Of course, the international side, we're dealing with a lot of national health organizations, where it's really not an issue at all.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Okay, thanks. In the RMS business, what -- any change to what you anticipate for the year? Any -- is that fourth quarter sizeable acquisition progressing as expected?", "And I guess, just a kind of big picture, given the economic downturn, would you anticipate fewer or more recalls in such an environment? Thanks.", "Mark Miller", "I think, first of all, our guidance is still the same. And we are -- our goal is to be 90 to a 100 in that space. Clearly, it's hard to predict the size of the activities. But, I think we are seeing the trends of more and more awareness of the capabilities. We are capturing more and more recalls. I think also in the environment the current political and legal environment is also very conducive to more attention and focus on recalls. But, for us, all we really need is wanted a few big ones. And we'd make our numbers pretty easily.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Okay, thanks. Shifting gears again, pharmaceutical waste disposal of hospitals, seems like a large opportunity. And from what I am hearing, it's pilot is progressing into something somewhat larger. Could you speak to potential opportunity there and pricing strategy to the extent that you can, thanks.", "Mark Miller", "Yes, I think we are finishing up the pilot as you indicated. We've had pretty good acceptance by the customers. We think that it's a very solid offering, and it s an offering that kind of ducktails with the other package of services that we bring to the LQG market. So, we'll continue to move ahead with it.", "And I think it's really too early to start talking about the average size revenue things like that. But, it's been very well accepted and as you indicated we're moving our pilot.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Thanks. And one final one, any thoughts on swine food, and this could have an impact. We have sizeable in Mexico. And any potential thoughts on the international?", "Mark Miller", "Yeah, I think, first of all, at this point we don't see any material impact to add. I think, it's on the global scale, it's hard to tell at this point what will be the ramifications and rollout. I think our initial read is that to CDC and WHRO on top of it. They're following up with people. They're trying to look at the right things. What would likely happen, we can have impact where the more people go for testing or go to see their doctor at hospital on any minor thing is probably not going to drive a lot of volume in the meaningful acres of be, maybe those throat swaps (ph) and cultures and gloves and masks, that type of thing. But, it's not a huge number. That wouldn't make anything in at this point.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ellis of Merrill Lynch.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. Good evening, guys. First off, if we could just talk about the three domestic acquisitions. You mentioned the geographic breakdown, but I am wondering, are those all three traditional medical waste companies?", "Frank Brink", "Yes, they were.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And Cliniserve, could you talk I know in the past, there has been discussion that Cliniserve has a higher mix of small quantity versus large quantity customers. But, would you be able to quantify as you do in directional sense of how much of the revenue is small quantity versus large quantity for Cliniserve?", "Frank Brink", "Over half of their revenues would be SQ related. We are still fine tuning that obviously. When you get the customer list and you're really defining that. But, that's kind of the initial picture.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "I see. And could you, in light of the messrs (ph) Cliniserve, can you give us an update on where your total mix of SQ versus LQ is in UK. And perhaps, may be pro forma for the Cliniserve transaction?", "Frank Brink", "Yes, I think with Clini it did probably in the mid-20s as a percent of their total revenue.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. And I know recently you established subsidiaries in Brazil and Japan. And I am wondering, can you talk about within your acquisition pipeline. I know you don't quantify what the size is abroad. But, are there any potential acquisitions in Brazil and Japan. Or are those much more longer term opportunities at this point?", "Frank Brink", "Again on acquisitions, we will do transactions when we're ready. And obviously, to be ready in countries you need to have the infrastructure, you need to built the relationships. And that's really what's going on.", "We've been a little bit longer, as you know, already in Japan. So, that's been around with the joint ventures we have there and really, the licensing. So -- but Brazil is an opportunity for us. And we are learning more about that country. And that gives us a chance to then do a transaction and be ready to do it by having that subsidiary in place.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. And then, just on the accounts base this quarter and you provided the overall numbers. But, I am wondering, for instance, on the LQ contract as a 58, does that include acquisitions that have been made this quarter? Or is that organic wins?", "Frank Brink", "No, that's both. That total number is both acquisitions in there as well as the globe.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And would you be able to break down, what the contribution was from acquisitions versus organic?", "Frank Brink", "We normally don't totally break it. But Rich already had given you that were 58 (ph) on the LQ side.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And this 58 news (ph) you're saying was all...", "Frank Brink", "Those were organic, yeah.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Those were all organic.", "Richard Kogler", "Yeah, just to clarify again, because 58 medical waste contracts are all new organic growth, 74 new Bio Systems contract. What Frank was referring to is the total customer count, LQ which is the probably around 10,000 total LQ customers.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. I see. And then just on the small quantity side, I don't know would you be able to give us some sense. I realize you haven't given this in the past. But, maybe even directionally, did more of the growth in the account base come from acquisitions versus organic this quarter, or vice versa?", "Frank Brink", "More came from organic this quarter.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. And then just finally, if you could talk a little bit, I know that there was a division you recently launched, specialty waste solutions division. And I'm wondering, maybe if could talk a little bit about what the strategy is there. And I realize it's probably in embryonic stage, reminder sitting (ph) it has to do with our offering document shredding, and spill management, and those types of services to customers.", "Can you talk a little bit about, are you focusing on large quantity versus small quantity. Is it something you do with the internal personnel or use subcontractors? Maybe a little bit of color around this division?", "Mark Miller", "The group was really established, because once in a while, we have acquisitions that may also do some document shredding or some e-waste (ph). It's very immaterial. It's not a main focus. And as a part of that service coming with those acquisitions, we obviously continued to service those with those customers. And that's where that service is really residing. There is no specific focus from that point on that to really in that sense make it a lot bigger. But, it is more that have came in through acquisitions.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "I see. So, you're just basically kind of formalizing the assets you already have as opposed to launch a new platform for a significant growth going forward.", "Mark Miller", "Correct and it's more of division and not of division, it's more a legal entity issue, than it is really a separate division for that matter.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. And just one final question from a cash flow standpoint, but based on my math, DSOs were the lowest point they've been since the first quarter of '05. And I'm just wondering, is there any reason why we may see more of an acceleration than we typically do on a seasonal basis in 2Q and 3Q, in terms of DSOs?", "Frank Brink", "No, I think normally Q1 is a little bit better internationally. It has some prepaids (ph) in there. If you look historically, Q1 has been a stronger one. I think still, from an overall picture point of view, we're looking at mid-50s to high-50s, is what our trend has been. And that's a good number to hold to. I don't expect -- we're going to work hard to keep it down and to bring it down. Mark is sitting next to me and saying, Hey, common let's go. But, I think from a planning and forecasting honestly, it's conservative to leave it in the mid to high 50s.", "Jonathan Ellis - Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from the line of Scott Levine of JP Morgan.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan", "Good afternoon, guys.", "Mark Miller", "Good afternoon.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan", "Looks like, the free cash flow guidance coming up a little bit here. Is that purely the flow through on acquisitions, or are there any other changes working capital management or otherwise that are driving that number higher?", "Frank Brink", "No, I think overall, we obviously had a strong first quarter. I think the working capital is going well. The investment we're making, and the focus is working. So, that part acquisitions contribute a little bit to that. So, I think the two main ones are working cap and acquisitions. And in Q1, CapEx was a little bit lower. So, it will help the free cash flow number just slightly. But, I mean, we are talking 2 to 3 million from that part.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan", "Okay and there is no change to the CapEx solid for the full year?", "Frank Brink", "The full year we've still count kind of as a 50 to 55 from a range point of view, million dollars.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan", "Yes, but just about downside and to that number potentially, or is that kind of a good mean and steady...", "Frank Brink", "No, that is maintenance and growth. We've always said that we're somewhere between the 4 to 5% of revenues. And so, it's more a timing that this quarter it was little bit lower. That's why for the year, we still feel that the 50 to 55 is a good number. And that includes growth again.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan", "Includes growth, okay. Turning to fuel really quickly, could you rough out again, the impact on the top-line and potentially, I don't know if it's possible to do so on the margin as well, how much the decline year-over-year roughly speaking. I think you've been talking about a 100, 200 basis point or so hit, or yeah, hit to the top-line last quarter. Is it roughly the same this quarter?", "Frank Brink", "Yeah, I think overall, there is a bunny (ph) in the quarter just from the overall picture and fuel being lower a little bit. And so, it's a little bit. That contributes obviously, to the gross margin. And we'll see what still is going to happen for the rest of the year?", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan", "Got you. One last one, very quickly, can you remind on the interest rates, fixed versus floating, total mix of debt?", "Frank Brink", "We are probably fairly similar to last quarter, which was about just north of 70% was fixed, and the rest was variable.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And the last question currently in queue is from the line of Greg Halter of Great Lakes Review.", "Greg Halter - Soleil Group", "Yes, thank you. And I don't know, on the last question there, do you have the percent that energy was as a relation to revenue?", "Richard Kogler", "For the quarter, it was 5.1% for total energy.", "Greg Halter - Soleil Group", "Total energy, okay. And is international now around, and I guess, maybe this would include Cliniserve, but around 24, 25% of your total business?", "Frank Brink", "No, it's about -- in fact, because of the foreign exchange, we're almost 20%, 19.9.", "Greg Halter - Soleil Group", "Okay. So, it's good.", "Frank Brink", "Cliniserve wasn't in the quarter yet, okay. So, that is for the quarter Q1, not for the year.", "Greg Halter - Soleil Group", "Okay. And I noticed on your website that you are handling the Postasio (ph) recall. Was any of that in the Q1 returns figure?", "Richard Kogler", "Very smaller amount. And typically, with that type of a product, it's more the communication, notification spot checking the like, because consumer would throw out that kind of product away. And it's really more just the infrastructure capabilities activity.", "Greg Halter - Soleil Group", "Okay. So, that's a smaller type that you would handle in that instant?", "Richard Kogler", "Yeah.", "Greg Halter - Soleil Group", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", ": (Operator Instructions). The next question comes from the line of Chris Sessing of AMI Asset Management.", "Chris Sessing - AMI Asset Management", "Yeah, thanks for taking the call, my question. Given that the Cliniserve was kind of a tough one to get through. Do you think this is pretty much ends the acquisition activity in the UK?", "Richard Kogler", "No, not at all. I think the focus of the OFT was clearly, on specifically treatment, and incineration is still one of their main focus points. And there is many other m opportunities, both with the med waste and adjacent that we see opportunities within the UK for growth that have nothing to do with treatment at times. So, no, there is clearly opportunities there.", "Chris Sessing - AMI Asset Management", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "And gentlemen, there are no other questions in the queue at this time.", "Mark Miller", "Well, we thank you everybody. And we look forward to having a great year and seeing you again.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's conference call.

Baird", "Operator", "Good afternoon. My name is Abigail, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the second quarter 2009 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute, to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions) I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Frank ten Brink, Chief Financial Officer. Sir, please go ahead.", "Frank ten Brink", "Thank you. Welcome to Stericycle's quarterly conference call. Joining me on today's call will be Rich Kogler, COO, and Mark Miller, CEO.", "I will now read the Safe Harbor statement. Statements by Stericycle in this conference call that are not strictly historical are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, and should be viewed with caution. Factors described in the company's Form 10-K, 10-Q, as well as its other filings with the SEC, could affect the company's actual results, and could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from expected results. The company makes no commitment to disclose any revisions to forward-looking statements or any facts, events or circumstances after this date that may bear upon forward-looking statements.", "Now for the results of the second quarter, revenues grew $11.5 million to $289.3 million, up 4.1% from $277.8 million in the second quarter of '08. Revenues grew 9.3%, when adjusted for the unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $14.3 million. Domestic internal growth excluding returns management was up 7.7% and international internal growth adjusted for exchange was 6.4%. Domestic internal growth consisted of SQ up 9% and LQ up 6%. Returns management revenues were $18.3 million in the quarter.", "Gross profit was $136.5 million or 47.2% of revenues and SG&A expense excluding transactional expenses related to acquisitions were $55.7 million or 19.2% of revenues. Net interest expense was $8.2 million and net income was $43.9 million or $0.51 per share on an as reported basis and $0.52 adjusted for transaction expenses related to acquisitions.", "At the end of the quarter the revolver borrowings were approximately $370 million. On June 24 \u201909 we entered into a three-year term loan and initially borrowed $50 million. Since then we increased the borrowings by $145 million and we also have signed commitments for an additional $20 million. The proceeds of this new $215 million term loan will be used to repay the revolver facility. The interest rate on our new term loan ranges from 2.75% to 3.5% over LIBOR based and it is based on the company\u2019s leverage. We anticipate that our after-tax interest cost for the remainder of \u201909 will increase by approximately $1.8 million as a result of this new facility. The unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $250 million and adjusted for the new term loan would have been $465 million.", "We repurchased 40,162 shares of common stock on the open market in an amount of $1.9 million in the quarter. Cumulative we have purchased approximately 12.2 million shares and we still have authorization to purchase approximately 4 million shares. Our capital spending was $9.5 million in the quarter, our DSO was 53 days and our cash provided from operations was $49.9 million for the quarter and $126.2 million year to date.", "I will now turn it over to Rich.", "Rich Kogler", "Thanks, Frank. We want to thank each member of our worldwide team for their solid performance and continued commitment to our customers and shareholders.", "During the quarter we enjoyed strong sales growth in all of our business segments. The SQG growth was primarily driven by Steri-Safe with over 80% of new Steri-Safe customers choosing select and preferred. Steri-Safe contributed approximately 67% of total small customer revenues. LQ sales growth was driven by the continued adoption of our Bio Systems offering and new LQG med waste contracts.", "In summary, we ended Q2 with over 430,000 accounts of which over 419,000 were small, and the remainder large.", "And now, I will turn it over to Mark.", "Mark Miller", "Thanks, Rich. I would now like to provide an insight on our current outlook for 2009. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements.", "In the second quarter, we completed five domestic and one additional international acquisition. The annualized revenue of these six acquisitions is over $14 million. Keep in mind our guidance does not include future acquisitions or divestitures and acquisition costs, which are now expensed for the new accounting rules. We believe that the analysts\u2019 EPS estimates will be in the range of $2.03 to $2.06 per share, which we are comfortable with. We believe analysts\u2019 revenue estimates will be in the range of $1.16 billion to $1.18 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange. We believe analysts will have estimates for net income between $176 million and $179 million, depending on their assumptions on margin improvement and interest expense and we believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow of between $185 million and $195 million, with CapEx anticipated between $45 million and $50 million.", "In closing, we are very excited about the tremendous growth opportunities in 2009 and beyond. We thank you for the time and operator we'll now open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) Your first question comes from Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair", "Yes thanks and good evening guys. I had a quick question just to follow up on your guidance, I know it looks like you have narrowed the range upward a little bit and that $2.03 to $2.06 does that guidance include any FAS 141R meaning that you guys have had roughly $2 million year to date, should we be backing that out to get to your $2.03 to $2.06.", "Frank ten Brink", "It just includes the year to date but not any future.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair", "Okay. So that $2.03 to $2.06 is based on the GAAP numbers that have been reported year to date.", "Frank ten Brink", "That is it. For the first two quarters you should adjust for it. So this is adjusted already for the first two quarters, so you should take it out.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair", "Okay so we are using the $0.52 in Q2 to get to this guidance.", "Frank ten Brink", "Yes.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair", "Okay perfect. And then a couple of quick housekeeping questions too on top of that, can you just give me the number of Steri-Safe customers and overall on premium and then the total LQ and Bio Systems adds for the quarter?", "Frank ten Brink", "Yes. You are asking first for the total number of Steri-Safe customers?", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair", "Yes, sure and then a percent of premium?", "Frank ten Brink", "Yes, the total number is over $137,000 and the percent on premium is \u2013 or actually the total number on premium right now is over $43,000, so the LQ adds 57% med waste contracts and 71% Bio Systems.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair", "Okay, looks pretty consistent. Okay great. And then a couple of broader ones, I know you launched the equivalent of Steri-Safe in Canada I think the clinical services offering, I am curious if you could talk a little bit about how that has been received and maybe what we might see with expensing [ph] on the other geographic fronts maybe the UK later in the year, any thoughts there?", "Mark Miller", "I think we continued to see good progress in the international markets adding on to our small quantity offering, still fairly early (inaudible) grow a lot of services but early adoption has been good in Canada and we will continue to look at programs in other markets as well as we move forward.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair", "Okay. And then the last two questions are just on the M&A front, Frank you have shared with us the pipeline size in the past and I am curious now that if we remove MedServe from the pipeline given that you have announced that deal how it looks today.", "Frank ten Brink", "The pipeline is over $50 million and that excludes MedServe.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair", "And then last question will be any update on timing there is there likely to be a third quarter, fourth quarter close?", "Mark Miller", "No, I think the HSR review process takes some time and right now both ourselves and MedServe are in the process of providing information to DOJ, through that process of course DOJ is getting up to speed on an industry that they really have not looked at for a number of years probably not in depth since we did the transaction with DFI in 1999. So once all this information is submitted, it typically takes DOJ about 30 or 60 days to review and respond and once the review is completed we can close obviously in a matter of days or weeks because we have the dollars with our new revolver borrowings.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair", "Okay great, thanks for the color. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Levine with JP Morgan. Your line is open.", "Scott Levine \u2013 JP Morgan", "Good afternoon guys. Steri-Safe on the percentage of select preferred if I am looking at accurate history it looks like there was a step up in the percentage of new adopters taking the premium offerings, how is that kind of coming in relative to your expectations and do you see yourselves running into any issues in the current economic environment there it did not seem [ph] that you are seeing any issues there?", "Frank ten Brink", "No I think you have kind of hit it right on, we are seeing a steady trend upward. Sales force is getting obviously more adept at presenting the value to the customers and I think the results kind of speak for themselves. Even in today\u2019s environment it is a good value proposition and we are doing well.", "Scott Levine \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay and then turning to uses of cash flow, it sounds like the acquisition pipeline is still robust and the activity is still high, could you help us think about how you guys plan, will there by any changes in the activity levels remain high with regard to how you guys plan to use the buyback going forward and how would the closing MedServe potentially affect that?", "Frank ten Brink", "Well again both domestic and internationally there are always many new companies entering into the business and so opportunities on acquisitions remains the number one investment opportunity for us. We obviously first would like to conclude the MedServe transaction and acquisitions both international and domestic are robust. We again do not include the international number outside of North America in the $50 million. So (inaudible) will continue to do opportunistic, we do that based on again IRR calculations and historically obviously it is now bought back in the range of 47 to low 50s in the past.", "Scott Levine \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay. One last one on cash, it looks like there was a negative working capital swing if I have been calculating correctly in the quarter, do you expect that to reverse down the coming quarters and is there anything noteworthy there?", "Frank ten Brink", "No, the second quarter is always a quarter that is negative because it includes the tax payments for both Q1 and Q2 that you do not make in Q1 but it ends up to be made in April and in June. So second quarter will always be for us and for many companies be a lower cash from ops quarter.", "Scott Levine \u2013 JP Morgan", "Got it, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer & Co. Your line is open.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Thanks good afternoon. Couple of questions on different topics, with regard to the new revolver, you used the proceeds of that to pay down existing revolver correct?", "Frank ten Brink", "Yes the new one is in fact a term loan, it is a three-year term loan, it is not a revolver, it is fully drawn and those proceeds are used to pay down the revolver, so it in essence reloads the revolver for us.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Alright. Any other anticipated changes to how you have the financial structure of the company going forward just considering the upcoming MedServe the pending acquisition?", "Frank ten Brink", "No at this point obviously after the term loan is fully done it is $465 million in available and that is obviously at this point plus our free cash flow that we generate in a normal course of business that should be sufficient right now to keep us busy.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Okay thanks. RMS had a very tough comp year-over-year in the second quarter, what are you looking for out of that for the full year with regard to revenue?", "Mark Miller", "Our guidance that I gave you is a little conservative. We assumed about $80 million, if you will recall in prior calls we have talked about higher numbers if we give one or two big recalls and we still could exceed that but we did not have any big recall happen in Q2 so we are a little bit more cautious on how we built the guidance. I think the fundamentals we see are very strong, the regulatory framework, the penalties that are now being issued are increasing, so the awareness by companies of handling recalls properly is definitely up and we continue to expand the awareness of our business. We see our ability to capture new companies as customers experiencing our growth in that area has been good. And we think just given the current administrative environment in the area that we are in it should create greater opportunities. But it is a fundamental lumpy business and we try to be conservative on our forecasting for the remainder of the year for that business.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Okay thanks and on the last sentence you mentioned there that really one or two big ones coming in at the back half of the year could pop you up to the high end of the guidance \u2013", "Mark Miller", "Yes.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "To add to this point, we have moved half the year and I got it. Also you mentioned five US tuck-ins and one international for $14 million annualized, Cliniserve you closed I believe in April, does that exclude, because you had mentioned that on the first quarter call, is that in there or out of there?", "Frank ten Brink", "Cliniserve is not included in there; we did announce that one in the last conference call.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Okay thanks. And I guess you could speak a little bit more in depth to the five US and the one international, is there one big one in there or is it fairly even in the SQ, LQ whatever thought you can add to it?", "Frank ten Brink", "It is fairly spread out, the new one internationally is in Europe in Romania and the five domestically are fairly spread out and even.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "SQ or LQ in the domestic?", "Frank ten Brink", "I mean it is fairly split.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Okay. And then Romania geographically has been different from where you have been in the past, what is the strategy there you are going to build out around there?", "Rich Kogler", "Romanian opportunity was very interesting to us as we looked at the characteristics of the market. They have increasing implementation of regulations, tightening of regulations, very, very fragmented market and it reminded us quite a bit of our own experience in the United States in the early days of medical waste services in this country also a good basis for expansion across the Central Europe opportunity. The company that we did a transaction with is a leader in their space of a little over $4 million revenue stream and we will continue to apply the same basics of helping them try to grow, expand their business and provide some of the opportunities to let them take advantage of this program and services that the other countries have.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Thanks sounds interesting, one more if I could sneak it in on another topic, you are pilot of the used pharma in hospitals, could you give us an update on how that is progressing?", "Rich Kogler", "Yes it has actually moved out of pilot phase and we are now rolling it out to the hospital space. It is actually being well received, it fulfills a need, it is a fairly simple program and we kind of look at it as another offering that is complementary to the RMW as the basic service and Bio Systems. It is still small, so as you have seen us do before, we pilot for a period of time and then we begin a very small kind of graduated roll out, so it is really not material to the numbers of the guidance right now but we are seeing a lot of customer interest.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Excellent, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jonathan Ellis with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, good afternoon guys, wanted to first ask with respect to these five acquisitions in the United States, were those all regulated medical waste companies or did some of them have other ancillary services?", "Frank ten Brink", "All were regulated medical waste; one had more of a house tint [ph] to it.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great and then any new joint ventures or licensing agreements in new countries this quarter?", "Frank ten Brink", "No.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Just in terms of the multiple state for the acquisitions this quarter, can you give us an average range?", "Frank ten Brink", "We are marching in line again, slightly around the 6 multiple of EBITDA and that we would again do on a net present value basis, there was both cash issued you saw in the cash flow statement and notes issued.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. And then just turning our attention to Medserve, if I understood you correctly you are still providing information to regulators that does mean that the clock has not started ticking yet on the 30 to 60-day period that they are required to come back to you with an opinion?", "Frank ten Brink", "Yes.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Okay, so we are still waiting on that clock to start ticking. Could you maybe give us some sense or color why you elected to borrow additional funds against that term loan at the end of July, why at this point as opposed to perhaps closer to when the MedServe transaction may close?", "Frank ten Brink", "Again it was a good opportunity for us, we are also looking for again differentiation in the balance sheet with different tools from a capital structure point of view. We continued to look both domestically and internationally for a robust acquisition environment and it is all those that we felt the availability will be good to put in place.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Okay great. And then just on Cliniserve, any update there in terms of the integration, I know usually you target at least the turn of EBITDA in the form of synergies, can you give us any more specifics though in terms of what your expectations are for cost savings related to that particular transaction?", "Frank ten Brink", "It is probably a little too early, I think when we get closer I think that would be better but obviously there are synergies, transportation specifically.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Then just my final question, energy cost during the quarter, what were those as a percentage of revenue?", "Frank ten Brink", "They were 4.6%.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "4.6% of revenue. Great, thanks guys.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Dave Manthey with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.", "Dave Manthey \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Hi, good afternoon. In terms of the gross margin, which came in much stronger, than we thought, is the higher contribution margin sustainable based on the cross-sell and up-sell activity and is there any other factors that went into the higher gross margin?", "Frank ten Brink", "Yes we had one time favorable pick up from benefits on the domestic which was probably about 40 basis points, we did have favorable mix and operating efficiencies in the quarter and those were partially offset by kind of lower gross margins that we had and that are normal with acquisitions. But year over year like in the last call probably people had about 200 basis points year-over-year improvement in margins, now that maybe is about 210 for the year.", "Dave Manthey \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Okay and then back to the fuel just so we are clear on the impact there, when you look year to year was there a top line impact or margin impact due to fuel or transportation?", "Frank ten Brink", "No. There always is obviously with fuel as we have said in the past it is probably about 200 basis points impact on revenues is what we have historically indicated.", "Dave Manthey \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Okay and then finally as it relates to the regulatory landscape, Mark I think you mentioned in relation to the returns management there was more regulation going on there but can you talk just in broad strokes about the EPA any more aggressive enforcement, etc?", "Mark Miller", "Yes, the EPA obviously is still looking hazardous or quite not hazardous but medical waste incinerator regulations those have not been promulgated, they are still being reviewed, if those come about they tend to fall disproportionately I guess on the smaller incinerators, the ones that are still remaining out there at hospitals because they obviously have a harder time with the capital expenditures involved. And then EPA has been obviously beating the drum for several years now on waste pharmaceuticals and that is obviously spurring the pharmaceutical waste program that we are rolling out to our LQG customers.", "Dave Manthey \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Okay. I am sorry I just had one more out of related question, can you discuss how much of the $800,000 acquisition related costs are related to MedServe versus other acquisitions and then could you talk about where that number might go in subsequent quarters?", "Frank ten Brink", "Again we cannot break it out, the question was also in the last call how much is that in the future, we do not include it in our guidance, it is difficult to forecast and do not really want to include it in our guidance right now.", "Dave Manthey \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "There are no further questions in queue at this time.", "Mark Miller", "Again, we thank you everybody and we look forward to another great quarter in Q3 and beyond. All the best.", "Operator", "This concludes your conference call for today. You may now disconnect.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Baird", "Jason Rodgers \u2013 Great Lakes Review", "Operator", "Good afternoon. My name is Kim and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the fourth quarter 2009 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions) Thank you.", "I would like to turn the call over to the CFO, Frank ten Brink. You may begin your conference.", "Frank ten Brink", "Thank you. Welcome to Stericycle's quarterly conference call. Joining me on today's call will be Rich Kogler, COO, and Mark Miller, CEO.", "I will now read the Safe Harbor statement. Statements by Stericycle in this conference call that are not strictly historical are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, and should be viewed with caution. Factors described in the company's Form 10-K, 10-Q, as well as its other filings with the SEC could affect the company's actual results and could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from expected results. The company makes no commitment to disclose any revisions to forward-looking statements or any facts, events, or circumstances after this date that may bear upon forward-looking statements.", "Now, into the results. The results for the fourth quarter are as follows: Revenues grew $39.5 million to $313.5 million, up 14.4% from $274 million in Q4 of 2008. Revenues grew 13.5% when adjusted for the favorable foreign exchange impact of $2.6 million. Domestic internal growth, excluding returns management, was up approximately 6% and international internal growth adjusted for foreign exchange was up over 5%. Domestic internal growth consisted of SQ up 8% and LQ up 3%. The regulated recalls and returns management services revenues were $16.1 million.", "Gross profit was $147.1 million or 46.9% of revenues. Excluding the restructuring costs, the gross margin would have been 47.2%. SG&A expense was $61.8 million or 19.7% of revenues. Net interest expense was $8.8 million, and net income attributable to Stericycle was $44.6 million or $0.52 per share on an as-reported basis and $0.55 adjusted for transactional expenses related to acquisitions and restructuring costs.", "At the end of the quarter, the revolver borrowings were approximately $382 million. Currently, $100 million of our revolver is hedged, at an average fixed 2.83% LIBOR rate plus 75 basis points. The remaining $282 million is floating at LIBOR plus 75 basis points or the prime rate, whichever is lower. The unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $244 million.", "We repurchased 93,670 shares of common stock on the open market in an amount of $4.5 million in the quarter. Cumulatively, we have purchased approximately 13.2 million shares. We still have authorization to purchase an additional 3.0 million shares.", "Our CapEx was 10.3 million, and our DSO at the end of the quarter was 52 days. The cash provided from operations in the quarter was $63.3 million and $277.2 million for the year.", "And now, I will now turn it over to Rich.", "Rich Kogler", "Thanks, Frank. We want to thank each member of our worldwide team for their solid performance and continued commitment to our customers and shareholders.", "In the quarter, we enjoyed strong sales growth in all of our business segments. SQ growth was primarily driven by Steri-Safe, with 80% of new Steri-Safe customers choosing Select or Preferred programs. LQ sales growth was driven by the continued adoption of our Bio Systems offering and new service agreements.", "In summary, we ended Q4 with over 459,000 accounts, of which approximately 447,900 were small, and the remainder large.", "I will turn it over to Mark.", "Mark Miller", "Thanks, Rich. I would now like to provide insight on our current outlook for 2010. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements.", "During the fourth quarter, we completed six acquisitions, two domestic and four international. The incremental revenue impact in the fourth quarter of this year was approximately $6.3 million. The annualized revenues of these acquisitions is approximately $59.9 million. Now please keep in mind that our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures and the related transactional expenses, but our guidance does include these items for the MedServe transaction completed at the end of Q4.", "We believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $2.34 to $2.40, which we are comfortable with. Please note that this guidance includes approximately $0.04 negative impact per share of acquisition integration expenses. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2010 will be in the range of $1.32 billion to $1.35 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange. We believe analysts will have estimates for net income between $202 million and $208 million depending upon assumptions for margin improvement and interest expense. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow of $245 million to $255 million, with CapEx anticipated between $45 million and $50 million.", "In closing, we are very excited about the tremendous growth opportunities this year and beyond. We thank you for your time; and operator, we will now switch to the Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels from William Blair & Company. Your line is now open.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Yes, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe, if I could just start on the M&A front, Mark, could you talk a little bit more about the deals you did? Obviously, this is a great quarter and I know a lot of the revenue there is MedServe, but maybe the other incremental deals and in a focus on international, where those acquisitions were?", "Frank ten Brink", "Yes, let me take that. This is Frank. So we did six acquisitions. Four were international. There was one in Portugal, one in Romania, one in Canada, and one in Chile. There were two in the US, one of which was MedServe and another was a transaction on the East Coast.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Okay, and were all of those were kind of traditional med waste acquisitions?", "Frank ten Brink", "Yes, they were.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Okay, great. And then, maybe Frank, another quick one for you; I know at the start of the year last year, you guys were looking for free cash flow of kind of $175 million to $185 million. If I am doing my math right, looks like you ended up closer to $240 million. Was there anything during the year that surprised you, that drove that to become so strong and well above your initial guidance?", "Frank ten Brink", "No, I think the team has done extremely well when it comes to the receivable collections. Obviously, that contributed substantially to this year. The DSO was reduced from 57 to 52 days, so that obviously even in this market environment, they did an excellent, excellent job. And that I think is a major to \u2013 CapEx was maybe a little lower than we started from a guidance point of view in the year, so that I would say is the second contributor and the further increase in earnings during the year.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Sure, okay. And then, can you provide a little more color on the restructuring? I think you are moving some of the facilities. Is it just related to that for the returns business?", "Frank ten Brink", "Yes, in the returns business, we had a site consolidation that is still in the process. It is in Conyers, Georgia and Boynton Beach, Florida that are getting consolidated into Indianapolis.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Yes, okay. And then, maybe a couple more that I ask every quarter for our model. Do you actually have the number of new LQ clients and Bio System clients? And then, the second part would be Steri-Safe total customers and percent on Premium and Select?", "Rich Kogler", "Yes. The new LQ adds were 58, Bio Systems were 72. Total Steri-Safe accounts now are in excess or over 141,000. And the percent that are on the higher Premium programs is 32.8%.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Okay. And then I guess the last question and I will hop off. I think in your prepared comments you also said that of the new Steri-Safe, you are seeing 80% gravitate toward the Premium and Select offerings. I think that is a lot higher than what we have seen in the past and I am curious if you have changed the sales incentives or kind of the marketing approach or is just the market gravitating more and more towards that or does that have to do with international, kind of any color of why that was so strong.", "Rich Kogler", "You know, what we have said over time is that one, the sales team would get better at selling this product offering, explain the value. I think number two is that the market is realizing that there is good value here. And so the product is one that sort of sells itself. And then, these are people who are calling in, they are listening to the whole menu and that sort of thing that we want this Select or Preferred program because frankly, it helps us reduce our overall cost, it is a good value for our customer.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Okay, great. Thanks again, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ellis from the Banc of America. Your line is now open.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Banc of America", "Thanks. Maybe we could just start with the MedServe transaction. First off, I know previously you had guided to $0.02 of earnings accretion. Is that still what is baked into your guidance for 2010 or has that increased based on what you have been able to accomplish over the last month or so?", "Frank ten Brink", "No that still includes. So the $0.02 is still coming from MedServe. And then, in fact from last guidance, we are up about $0.03. The other $0.01 is other acquisitions, really offset with foreign exchange, which is a little bit dropping revenues down slightly. But again, as Mark indicated, in the guidance of $2.34 to $2.40 is the integration expense, which is about $0.04 per share.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Banc of America", "Right. And the $0.02 EPS accretion comes in there with that including integration costs or is that \u2013", "Frank ten Brink", "That did include the integration costs, correct. So without the integration costs, it would have been $0.06.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Banc of America", "$0.06? Okay, great. All right, that is helpful. In terms of the consolidation of the recall facilities, what is the estimated annualized cost savings from that?", "Frank ten Brink", "Again, we are not going into full detail, but obviously, we are doing it to gain the efficiencies. We have gotten everyone onto a common system, and again, it will have some more slight expenses in the year of 2010, about $1 million in one-time expenses. And obviously, that investment that we are making has a great IRR.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Banc of America", "Okay. In terms of the revenue outlook, I know previously the guidance for returns management had been $70 million or $90 million for 2010. Any update to that?", "Frank ten Brink", "That is the same.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Banc of America", "Okay. And then, in terms of the free cash flow outlook for the year vis-\u00e0-vis the net income increase and even accounting for the $0.04 of charges that I know are baked into your guidance, it seems like there is much more of a pickup in the free cash relative to the increase in your net income outlook. Can you just talk through what factors are driving the free cash benefit?", "Frank ten Brink", "So you get obviously from the last guidance the flow through that we are getting from the acquisitions. And then again, I mean when we give guidance the first time, we are nominally a little bit more conservative, we are trying to see what our tax advantages are during the year, same thing with receivables, although we are kind of holding that fairly flat. So, I mean, it is multiple factors, but we feel comfortable with the guidance we are giving here.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Banc of America", "Okay, great. And then, just in terms of the acquisitions you made abroad and the one specifically in Europe, how do you think of that in terms of being able to expand within the continent of Europe? Do you need to have asset bases within each country or can you use some of these initial acquisitions you made as a platform to serve other countries but perhaps not have as much as a heavy model in each country within continental Europe?", "Rich Kogler", "I think, take an example, obviously we entered Europe now indirectly a little bit in Romania. Portugal is the true first continental Europe. It is a leader that we bought there, a great team came with that, very solid platform, has three plants in country; that obviously now is a strong beach head to look for other opportunities. We continue to work on growth initiatives in Europe and we will take it country by country and we will see. It may move across borders; that is not as easy, but I think is helping over the time to have that infrastructure throughout Europe.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Banc of America", "Okay, great. And then just final question related to energy. What was that as a percentage of revenue this quarter?", "Frank ten Brink", "It was 5.1%.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Banc of America", "Okay. And did you \u2013 was there any benefit from incremental fuel surcharges, either in SQ or LQ this quarter?", "Frank ten Brink", "No, I think revenues obviously like last quarter were impacted slightly on a downside year over year comparisons, and so it is really in line with what it was in Q3 to 8% to 3% for SQ and LQ.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Banc of America", "Okay, thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk from Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "Good afternoon, guys. Frank, I was wondering, can you remind us what the split of revenue on MedServe is between international and domestic?", "Frank ten Brink", "It is roughly, it is in essence still a little bit too early, since the integration is ongoing. But it is slightly more on the SQ than it is on the LQ as we see right now. It is not specific yet, but I mean that is a rough.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "Right. And then just a little bit broader picture, maybe directed towards Mark. You know, with the perception that there was more regulation involvement in this transaction, have you learned anything or taken into consideration information that may evolve your M&A acquisitions strategy? And this is more served from a positive side standpoint than a negative comment, please.", "Mark Miller", "Well, I will start and then Rich may want to add color. But this is a process we have gone through now a couple of times. It is very deliberate and analytical. The outcome didn't surprise us as we went through the process and we have gone through this in other countries. So I don't think there is anything that is a huge change on how we would proceed forward on transactions. Rich, I don't know if there is anything else?", "Rich Kogler", "There is a process, I think some of you may be familiar with it, or may not, but we have been through these multiple times. The Department of Justice does a very in-depth review of the entire market. All the participants are very, very detailed. That is why it actually took a number of months to get through this. And so, by looking at the whole market, they kind of \u2013 in the end, form a conclusion about it and as their conclusion sort of matched up with what we thought, and so I think in the end, we don\u2019t really see much change and we don't see anything dramatically different that resulted from the outcome; and obviously, we are moving forward.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "Okay, and just as a follow up question on some of those Premium/Select, is there room for pricing power, given some of the receptivity you are getting from your customer base? Maybe you don't want to comment on that on the call here, but \u2013", "Frank ten Brink", "No, I think it is a little different. You need to understand that a customer that takes Select or Preferred is still many times comparing it to costs that they have right now. So if someone is doing the training, if they have material safety data sheets, if they are complying with OSHA, most likely the alternative, which is having people come to their offices, have different vendors, it is going to be more costly than our Select and Preferred is. So that part is really under the under the pressure in the economy, continues to give us a good opportunity to sell to customers, because it is a cost-savings.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "Thank you. I will hop back in the queue.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Levine from JP Morgan. Your line is now open.", "Scott Levine \u2013 JP Morgan", "Good afternoon, guys. Did you give your leverage calculation through covenant?", "Frank ten Brink", "No, we did not. It was 2.51. 2.51 as debt to EBITDA.", "Scott Levine \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay, got it. And so, it sounds like you are well within your comfort zone there. If you could comment with regard to \u2013 it sounded like on the last call you had suggested that the accretion from MedServe was kind of more back-end loaded. Does the integration process or anything else really kind of cause you to take your foot off the gas when it comes to acquisitions or is it kind of business as usual here?", "Frank ten Brink", "No, I think it is business as usual and it is correct. The $0.02 is definitely backend loaded into the last two quarters.", "Scott Levine \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay, and if you could comment, I think you recently completed a pilot phase on your Pharmaceutical Waste program. Could you comment regarding the commercial potential for that, perhaps, or is it still too early to quantify?", "Rich Kogler", "Well, you know, we actually are starting a phased rollout, which I think we talked about in the last call and the nice thing about this program is again, it meets the customer need, it is driven by the focus that the EPA and the safety regulators have on pharmaceuticals in the environment. You know, it is too early I think to sort of predict where this will go, but the receptivity from the customer has been good in every market we see interest. You know, the sales force is very excited about it. And we think that it has applications here and globally, because this is the sort of issue that really touches all countries.", "Scott Levine \u2013 JP Morgan", "Understood. One last one and maybe \u2013 are actually two really quickly. Did you give the SQ, LQ breakout specifically in the UK market?", "Frank ten Brink", "It is in the high-20s is the SQ in the UK. That is the percentage of revenues for SQ.", "Scott Levine \u2013 JP Morgan", "Got it, okay. And then, one last one on the returns business; I know you don\u2019t break out the recall side from the return side, but is it right to think that you know, there just really hasn\u2019t been a lot of large project activity on the recall side and maybe if you could characterize your growth expectations for the business on a longer-term basis, consistent with what you guys are expecting one or two years ago?", "Frank ten Brink", "Yes. So the awareness campaign continues to work. We continue to see strong customer growth and quantity of customers that we service, the outsourcing is more efficient for them. And so at the end it remains a hard-to-predict kind of sector for us, the recalls. But the scope of recalls can really vary along with the revenues for each event, depending on what we do for those customers.", "Scott Levine \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Thanks, good evening. Just kind of following up on that last one and tying it back to SG&A, Frank, you mentioned spending and recalled returns is one of the areas where that is happening. Any change to the SG&A outlook as we look out to 2010?", "Frank ten Brink", "No, I think if look at the Q4 2009, obviously acquisitions raised the percentage to revenue to the high 19s and in 2010, you know, we expect to kind of incur (inaudible) depending on how you model it maybe to 5.4 in integration, some of you don\u2019t. But the trends will be down during the year, as integration progresses; and so for the full year, we should be kind of in the mid-19s, slight tack above the mid-19s.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Okay, thanks. And then with regard to acquisitions in the quarter, this was asked earlier, primarily on MedServe, so I assume that rings true across each of the acquisitions as a whole since that is a big piece, when it was answered, more SQ than LQ, but you know, just kind of for those of us who model the acquisition, is that a 60/40, 70/30 anything, any further color, and not specifically asking on MedServe but all the six in the quarter?", "Frank ten Brink", "I think if you have MedServe, you know, starting at a 50-50, the others are really far more on the international side. It is really more in LQ than SQ. So I mean if they are not far off first is the rest of the world, so that definitely is more LQ than SQ.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Okay, thanks. That is helpful. And then finally, with the hospital pharma waste, can you give us \u2013 I am going to ask a few questions and hopefully you will answer to some extent, but what do you see as the market potential there? How far have you rolled it out with regard to geography or I don't know, any other metric you care to give? Just to give us a little bit of help of how far along it is right now.", "Rich Kogler", "Yes. I mean we have moved out of pilot phase, we have begun to offer it in most geographies, but not all. I think the market potential really is all LQ and I say that because every hospital dispenses pharmaceuticals, every hospital is going to be subject to these regulations and so you know, in terms of potential, this is probably the same or larger than Bio Systems was, which is again is the product that every hospital can probably use. I mean, I guess you are trying to ballpark it. I would say it is a couple of million similar to Bio Systems.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Okay. And with where you are now and, you know, not making you put something out there that we would hold you to, but you know, you said you were in a lot of regions, not all, and thank you for citing what you think it can become. What type of time frame to the extent you can answer it. Thanks.", "Rich Kogler", "Well, I think the timeframe to move it out will be similar to what you saw us do with Bio Systems. But to give you an example, I am kind of like stuffing up the reply, I am the first batter in the first inning, it is tough. That is where I am at in terms of moving this thing along. So there is quite a bit of runway left and you know, we are in the early stages.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Richard Skidmore from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Richard Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thank you, good afternoon. Just a couple of questions; first, on the MedServe acquisition. I believe that there were some divestitures or some assets that were supposed to be done. Are those complete, and if not, are they in your guidance and how much would you expect that that would impact the free cash flow in 2010?", "Rich Kogler", "Okay. The transaction just closed at the beginning of December. We are now in the process of working the divestiture, which as you recall is one plant, some transfer stations and some LQG accounts. I really don\u2019t want to comment much more on the timing or anything, because we have multiple buyers involved and anyway, it is not appropriate obviously to discuss it in detail on this call. The guidance that we have given includes the effect of these divestitures, both in terms of revenue and cash flow. So post-divestiture, the guidance we have given you is the guidance for the year.", "Richard Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And then just separately, on use of free cash flow, as you think about the guidance that you provided with regards to free cash flow, how would you think that that gets deployed in 2010 in terms of buckets with regards to M&A, share repurchase, et cetera?", "Frank ten Brink", "I think the two most important remain investment in the business, expanding the existing services, launching new programs and then acquisitions. Those are the two top ones and then repo, we continue to do opportunistically.", "Richard Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And then, shifting just quickly to the small customers, in terms of the retention rate, can you quantify how the retention rate has been in the SQ business and then on those customers that are on the standard model, what is the conversion rate of those customers to the premium and select?", "Frank ten Brink", "From a revenue retention, we remain strong at 95%. We don't go into the details of how converge. We do give obviously that the quantity of customers that have selected Steri-Safe of those in the quarter, 80%, select to put higher programs.", "Richard Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Manthey from Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.", "David Manthey \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Thank you. So the guidance you have given includes MedServe revenues and EPS accretion. Did you say it does or does not include MedServe acquisition related expenses?", "Frank ten Brink", "It does include $0.04 of those integration expenses and net of those $0.04, it is accretive by $0.02.", "David Manthey \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Okay. And so when you made the overall statement that the new guidance includes $0.04 of acquisition expenses, that is from MedServe and your old guidance didn\u2019t include any of those expenses, is that correct?", "Frank ten Brink", "It is, pretty much. 90% of it is related to MedServe.", "David Manthey \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Okay. And of the 19,000 new customers that you added, how many of those were from MedServe or other acquisitions versus organic new customers?", "Frank ten Brink", "Again, we don't break the total out but I made obviously get additional customers from MedServe and from the international so they both contributed. What we did say that we had 58 new LQs and that we were able to 72 customers on Bio, although some of those are existing customers.", "David Manthey \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Okay, and then I think in the past you have told us what percent Steri-Safe represented of total SQ revenues. I am not sure you gave it to us this time. Do you have that?", "Frank ten Brink", "Steri-Safe, as a percent is about 69% domestic revenue.", "David Manthey \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "And then on the P&L, the $905,000 for restructuring costs, can you divide those between the two, so we know where the restructuring at the cost.", "Frank ten Brink", "You broke up on that question. Could you say that again?", "David Manthey \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Sure. I'm trying to figure out on the $905,000, how much is restructuring versus how much is impairment costs?", "Frank ten Brink", "It is really most of it is the restructuring. There is barely any impairment in it. I mean, it is really part of the restructuring, it is fixed assets and things like that. It is the cost of the restructuring, and really the impact of the impairment as you can see from the table is almost negligible.", "David Manthey \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "All right. And then finally, what percentage of 4Q revenues comes from Bio Systems today?", "Frank ten Brink", "Right now, Bio Systems, hang on, I need to quickly look that up, about 23% to 24%.", "David Manthey \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Thanks very much, guys.", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Jason Rodgers from Great Lakes Review. Your line is now open.", "Jason Rodgers \u2013 Great Lakes Review", "Looking at the returns program, the returns in recall, I wondered if you had a number for the quarter (inaudible) revenues, what the total was 2009 and if you have a goal for 2010?", "Frank ten Brink", "The total for 2009 for the whole returns group was $70 million and for 2010, the guidance is $70 million to $90 million.", "Jason Rodgers \u2013 Great Lakes Review", "Okay. And you have a goal for new accounts for Bio Systems for 2010?", "Frank ten Brink", "Over 200. Again, similar to last year\u2019s goal.", "Jason Rodgers \u2013 Great Lakes Review", "Okay. And then, wondering on the progress on the Steri-Safe offering in Canada, thank you.", "Rich Kogler", "That program has just kind of run out or started out. And we are seeing pretty good adoption. I would kind of compare it to the first or second year when we started Steri-Safe here in the States. So we still have quite a bit more runway and we need to get it moved across all the provinces.", "Jason Rodgers \u2013 Great Lakes Review", "Thank you.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to the presenters.", "Mark Miller", "So we thank everyone for your time and attention and we look forward to speaking to you on the next call.

My name is Mason and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Stericycle first quarter 2010 earnings call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions) Thank you. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Ms. Laura Murphy, Vice President of Corporate Finance for Stericycle. You may now begin.", "Laura Murphy", "Welcome to Stericycle's quarterly conference call. Joining me on today's call will be Frank ten Brink, CFO; Rich Kogler, COO; and Mark Miller, CEO.", "I will now read the Safe Harbor statement. Statements by Stericycle in this conference call that are not strictly historical are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, and should be viewed with caution. Factors described in the company's Form 10-K, 10-Q, as well as its other filings with the SEC could affect the company's actual results and could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from expected results. The company makes no commitment to disclose any revisions to forward-looking statements or any facts, events, or circumstances after this date that may bear upon forward-looking statements.", "I will now turn it over to Frank.", "Frank ten Brink", "Thanks, Laura. The results for the first quarter are as follows: Revenues grew $58.1 million to $335.2 million, up 21% from $277.1 million in the first quarter of \u201909. Revenues grew 19.1% when adjusted for the favorable foreign exchange impact of $5.2 million. Domestic internal growth, excluding returns management, was up 7%; and international internal growth adjusted for foreign exchange was up 7%. Domestic internal growth consisted of SQ up 8% and LQ up 5%. Regulated recalls and returns management services returns revenues were $26.3 million.", "Gross profit was $155.3 million or 46.3% of revenues. Excluding the regulated returns management services restructuring cost, the gross margin would have been 46.5%. SG&A expense was $66 million or 19.7% of revenues. Net interest expense was $8.9 million, and the net income attributable to Stericycle was $48.1 million or $0.56 per share on an as-reported basis and $0.57 adjusted for after-tax transaction expenses related to acquisitions and restructuring costs.", "At the end of the quarter, the revolver borrowings were approximately $405 million, which is floating at LIBOR plus 75 basis points. The unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $251 million.", "We repurchased 207,114 shares of common stock on the open market in an amount of $11.3 million, of which cash in the quarter to settle was $10.6 million. Cumulatively, we have repurchased approximately 13.4 million shares, and we still have authorization to purchase an additional 2.8 million shares.", "Our capital spending in the quarter was $12.8 million, the DSO in the quarter was 51 days, and the cash provided from operations was $81.1 million for the quarter.", "And I will now turn it over to Rich.", "Rich Kogler", "Thanks, Frank. Our team delivered strong results worldwide highlighted by the following areas. We continue to see growth of our small quantity service offerings, and we increased adoption of our reusable sharps management and pharma waste services. We experienced a solid recall quarter, and all the countries delivered strong operating performance.", "I want to take this time to thank each member of our worldwide team for their solid performance and continued commitment to our customers and shareholders. I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark.", "Mark Miller", "Thanks, Rich. I\u2019d now like to provide insight on our current outlook for 2010. And please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements. At the end of the first quarter, we completed six acquisitions, two domestic and four international. The annualized revenue of these six acquisitions is over $37 million. Keep in mind our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures and the related transaction expenses, but our guidance does include these items for the MedServe transaction we spoke about in the last call.", "We believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $2.38 per share to $2.44 per share, which we are comfortable with. And please note that this guidance includes approximately $0.04 per share negative impact from the acquisition integration expenses for MedServe. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2010 will be in the range of $1.35 billion to $1.38 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange.", "And we believe analysts will have estimates for net income between $206 million and $211 million depending on assumptions for margin improvement and interest expense. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow of between $245 million to $255 million, with CapEx anticipated between $45 million and $50 million.", "In closing, we are very excited about the tremendous growth opportunities in 2010 and beyond. We thank you for listening to our prepared comments. And we\u2019ll now answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Jonathan Ellis from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. Couple of housekeeping items. First, can you provide the total number of SQ and LQ accounts as of the end of the quarter?", "Rich Kogler", "Yes. The total number of SQ account \u2013 the total number of accounts is just slightly over 465,000, about 12,000 LQ and the remainder is small.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "12,000 LQ, okay. And then the total number of Steri-Safe counts in percentage on higher levels?", "Rich Kogler", "The number of accounts is over 443,000 currently, and the amount on higher levels is about 33.7%.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. And do you have also an update on the push in new accounts that\u2019s signed up for one of the higher levels of Steri-Safe?", "Rich Kogler", "We are looking at over 80%.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. And then do you have \u2013typically you provide the number of new contracts for LQ and biosystems in the quarter.", "Rich Kogler", "Yes. The LQ contracts were 57 in the quarter; biosystems, 73.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Okay, great. Just the international acquisitions, could you talk about where they were this quarter?", "Frank ten Brink", "Yes, there were four international acquisitions. One in Brazil, our entry into Brazil; there were two transactions in the United Kingdom; and one in Chile.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And the $37 million of annualized revenue, can you give us some sense \u2013 is that more weighed to the international acquisitions this quarter versus the domestic?", "Frank ten Brink", "Yes, the international was a bigger portion of that.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. And the six companies you are acquiring in total, are they all traditional medical waste companies or any of them providing other service lines?", "Frank ten Brink", "Yes. The domestics were all tuck-in. Brazil was a med waste, and yes, they were all tuck-in acquisitions.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Just if you can provide an update on the MedServe integration? Is \u2013 where does that stand in terms of facility consolidations and re-routing? Can you provide us a status report there?", "Rich Kogler", "The integration remains on track. As we said, we would take the early part of this year and through the summer to complete it. We are on track with our original plan. We still believe that there is $0.02 accretion once the integration is completed in the back half of the year.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then just my final question is, when you look at \u2013 now that you sure had some chance to really delve into the books of MedServe and look at the account base. Are you noticing any difference between the pricing for MedServe customers versus Stericycle customers that are receiving similar equivalent services?", "Rich Kogler", "No, not really.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Levine from JP Morgan. Your line is now open.", "Rodney Clayton \u2013 JP Morgan", "Hi, guys. This is actually Rodney Clayton. Good afternoon.", "Frank ten Brink", "Hello, Rodney.", "Rodney Clayton \u2013 JP Morgan", "So first question, on the margins, just looking to get a little more color there. Looks like margins may have eased a little bit versus the last couple of quarters. Can you give us some color on what\u2019s maybe driving that, if it\u2019s full or anything else in the quarter that may have impacted it?", "Frank ten Brink", "Yes. So the most important factor, first of all, is the impact of the acquisitions that we did in the fourth quarter, specifically MedServe, and then the acquisitions we did ongoing also in the first quarter. Those reduced, kind of if you start from the fourth quarter, the gross margin by about 66 basis points just by mix. And obviously we also had a very strong quarter with the recall and returns management group. The mix there impact was about 22 basis point, and then the normal business was up roughly in the 20 basis points.", "Rodney Clayton \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay, got it. That\u2019s helpful. On the pharma waste rollout, can you just give us a general update on how that\u2019s progressing? I think on the last call you indicated you are rolling out in most of your geographies, but not all. Is that still the thought process there?", "Rich Kogler", "Yes. I think we\u2019re still in the first innings of that. We talked about it on last couple calls, and while we offered most geographies, we are not quite in all yet. We\u2019re very excited. I mean, the customers are excited by it. It fulfilled the regulatory requirement that they have. And we think our skill sets, the kind of experience we have been dealing with large quantity customers positions us to do well in this market. The \u2013 as I think we\u2019ve said perhaps on the last call, just the domestic market size for this is probably equivalent to biosystems. And of course, it has applications in international markets too.", "Rodney Clayton \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay, got it. On the MedServe deal, the divestiture that you are planning, is there any update there on maybe timing or what you expect there?", "Rich Kogler", "We are expecting it to close in Q2.", "Rodney Clayton \u2013 JP Morgan", "In Q2. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then finally, can you give me a leverage calculation for your covenant?", "Frank ten Brink", "The debt was 2.39 on a debt-to-EBITDA that was down from 2.51 at the end of the fourth quarter last year.", "Rodney Clayton \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk from Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "Good afternoon, guys. Frank, could you add how much in the quarter acquisitions contributed to the top line and that that was accretive or neutral?", "Frank ten Brink", "Yes. There was $3 million. It was accretive. The revenue for the year for \u201910 is going to be about $31 million. And then annualized basis, as Mark said, little over $37 million.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "Okay. And then on the returns business, I realize it\u2019s a lumpy, very unpredictable ticket when you can get it. How would you characterize the start of the year for what you see for the balance of the year in terms of the revenue guidance in particular?", "Rich Kogler", "Yes. We\u2019re maintaining guidance, as we had been before, about $70 million to $90 million. And the delta there really is the number of recalls and the size of recalls. We do believe our awareness campaign is working. We are pleasantly surprised to see that the number of recalls are up, and obviously in Q1, we had a couple large ones.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "I would like to drill down on the UK for a moment. Are you able to give us the split between SQ and LQ for that particular market?", "Rich Kogler", "Yes, it\u2019s still in the high-20s, approaching 30%.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "30% is \u2013", "Frank ten Brink", "That\u2019s the SQ.", "Rich Kogler", "SQ.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "Thank you. And then finally, I\u2019ll hop back in queue, how should we read the acquisition in Brazil? I think, Frank, you had mentioned that it was an entry, but how are you \u2013 as you look at your \u2013 maybe this is more for Mark, but \u2013 as you look out at the international business, I think strategically you\u2019ve talked about building sort of a franchise or a platform and then adding on. But is this an aggressive start to Brazil or is this an entry point that will take further time to plan out? So if you could just maybe comment or update us on how would this rollout into the international front is going?", "Mark Miller", "Brazil, for us, was a very good entry. It\u2019s a large and growing market. This was one of the bigger companies in Brazil. We took a 70% interest because the existing owners are still very active and engaged in helping us grow. We see really good growth opportunities in it. And it has the plans and infrastructure. So we see it as a very exciting opportunity and a very good market for us.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "If I may just add, sorry, just an update, on acquisitions, and particularly once where the owners may stay involved, are the deals structured for potential earn-outs or is that not part of the program?", "Mark Miller", "Typically there is a variety of factors that are implied that sometimes there are options agreements, there is ability for increased ownership triggers on our part, and it varies by transaction.", "Al Kaschalk \u2013 Wedbush Securities", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels from William Blair & Company. Your line is now open.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Yes, thanks. Frank, I guess a quick follow-up question for you just on the MedServe integration expenses. If I\u2019m looking at it correctly, it looks like you had about $1.1 million in the quarter, roughly $0.01 in EPS. And I know you said it \u2013 you're still considering it probably costing $0.04 overall to integrate. Should we think of the additional $0.03 primarily coming in Q2 or will that be spread out in Q2 and then maybe a little bit of a tailwind in the third quarter as well?", "Frank ten Brink", "It will be spread between Q2 and Q3, and then definitely later in Q4.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Okay. But could it continue into the fourth quarter just modestly?", "Frank ten Brink", "Very small.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Okay, great. And then any update on the status of the recall facility consolidation? Was that actually completed? I know you had some small restructuring charges? But is that down or will that also spill into the second quarter?", "Frank ten Brink", "No, the restructuring is on track. There will be some cost in Q2, and that will then also take route.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Okay, great. And then maybe a little bit broader comment, just update on some of your OUS activities or growth initiatives, both in regards to maybe more actively cross-selling \u2013 I guess, initially selling into the small quantity business? And then second part of that would be cross-selling some of the clinical services or thoughts on maybe rolling out biosystems in larger markets like the UK. Any color there would be great.", "Mark Miller", "I think we continue to see opportunities to roll out. As you\u2019ve heard us talk about in the last call, the clinical services offering in Canada continues to go very well, as we move that in. But if you really think about the opportunity for Steri-Safe, on a worldwide basis, we are still only about 30% of our customer base today on some type of program. And on the biosystems, we are about less than 20% that are on reusable charts program. So we see those cross-selling opportunities is still a very big growth runway for us.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Okay, great. And then one final one, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to want to go into detail here, but I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019ve really kind of mapped up the revenue model on the pharmaceutical waste management. Obviously, talking about the market being similar, larger than biosystems, I assume the pricing is going to be pretty similar there as well. So I guess the question is, are you seeing a variation on how customers use that? Meaning, some want a full in-service model where you are there categorizing the waste, taking it offsite etc. where so much is consulting services. Is there a big deviation or is it a pretty standard model?", "Rich Kogler", "What I\u2019ve seen at this point is similar to biosystems and similar to a majority of services we provide. Customers want us to help them with non-healthcare related compliance issues. And so what we\u2019ve seen is that we have that unique skill set. Because of biosystems, we are already inside of many of these hospitals. We know how to train because we\u2019ve been training our customers since day one and how to comply with RMW and everything else. So I think there is not huge variability in how the model is accepted or demanded by the customer. It\u2019s really one where they want this thing taken off of their back. And again, because we have the experience, we really can kind of favor things to meet their needs. That\u2019s how we do it.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Okay, perfect. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Manthey from Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.", "David Manthey \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Thank you. Good afternoon. In the annual this year, you talked about your priorities being domestic and international growth and it gets pretty clear. And then you also talked about profit growth and service innovation. I\u2019m wondering \u2013 and I guess the service innovation you are touching on some of these new \u2013 the pharma returns and so forth. But could you touch on profit growth? You mentioned streamlining operation. I\u2019m just wondering if there are some initiatives there and what we should expect to see from those initiatives.", "Rich Kogler", "Yes. I mean, we\u2019ve been \u2013 I think I have to actually compliment my team. It\u2019s not we, the people in this room, but the folks in the field have done a tremendous job over the years of continually refining our operations and driving efficiency. And you\u2019ve seen us weather all kinds of headwinds because of their work. What we have now throughout the whole organization, both domestically and international, is an ongoing continuous improvement program based on lean principles and other guidelines like that that helps give us sort of a common language for driving those efficiencies. So that\u2019s when \u2013 when we reference that in the Annual Report, we are referring to the fact that in every part of the company, in every location, people are focused on continuous improvement to drive operating efficiencies, and more importantly, they are focused on what we call customer first. So do the best that you can for a customer and do it efficiently as you can.", "David Manthey \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Okay. So nothing externally measurable right now?", "Rich Kogler", "I don\u2019t think I understand your question.", "David Manthey \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "I\u2019m just saying in terms of \u2013 is there a dollar amount that you\u2019re trying to ring out of those \u2013 the streamlining operations, that sort of thing, or is it just sort of continuous improvement?", "Frank ten Brink", "Well, the continuous improvement obviously shows \u2013 if you again look at the downtick in the economy and everything and how we have weathered that, if you look at some of the periods of time when we keep improving margins even with severe headwinds, all those kind of factors show that our people are able to continuously improve and stay ahead of that curve.", "David Manthey \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Got it. Okay. And then final question, on \u2013 as you got MedServe in here and you\u2019re looking at it, speaking of these service innovations, are there competencies or services at MedServe that you\u2019ve discovered, that you think you can broadly provide across the Stericycle organization?", "Rich Kogler", "MedServe had some unique offerings tailored to SQ market, which we are looking at evaluating and integrating. They also had hazardous waste capability, which was something that was attractive to us as we moved into the hazardous and pharma waste space across the country. Those are the areas that we are focusing on right now.", "David Manthey \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is now open.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer & Company", "Thanks. Good afternoon. I want to first jump off \u2013 in Brazil, what part of Brazil are you in? How much of the country are you covering with this acquisition?", "Mark Miller", "The acquisition covers many of the major marketplaces in North Recife. As you go to the south area, Sao Paulo area, and other parts are still developmental markets, but primarily the north central.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer & Company", "Okay. And you mentioned it was one of the larger consolidated med waste companies. Can you give us a feel for how that market works, how many are larger than you, how many are in the same ballpark with this acquisition, and just a feel for the Brazil market overall? Thanks.", "Mark Miller", "It\u2019s extremely fragmented. And this was one of the larger ones that had multiple facilities in multiple locations.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer & Company", "Okay, thank you. And just a sense of how much treatment it is, is the treatment facility \u2013 again, one of the larger ones there, how many treatment facilities do you have? And is the \u2013 are the regulations quite similar to the US?", "Mark Miller", "There are three facilities. Regulation is not too dissimilar, but emerging predominantly today more large quantity that emerging regs that there really isn\u2019t good local data that you just look at the opportunity based on healthcare delivery system and the market. We think it could be well in excess of $0.5 billion.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer & Company", "Great, thanks. And real quick one, Chile earthquake, any impact to operations, any disruption, facilities damaged, anything \u2013?", "Mark Miller", "Actually those of you followed Chile, we had a plant in Concepcion that was impacted. Luckily, for us, not much damage to the plants to an extreme level. What I was really, really proud of is the operating team locally was able to scramble and get supplies and services to the plants and to their people. Some of our employees actually had severe damage to their homes. And again, the team pulled together across the world. The Stericycle folks kicked in money to help rebuild their homes and help them get back on track. So really a first-class effort by everybody in the local operations, and we were very impressed how quickly they recovered from a very dramatic natural disaster.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer & Company", "Great, thanks. Acquisition, just one more on that, domestically and internationally, could you just give a sense of LQ/SQ mix? Thanks.", "Frank ten Brink", "You mean, on the ones that we had just acquired?", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer & Company", "Exactly. In the current quarter, yes.", "Frank ten Brink", "Yes. So domestically, about a 50/50 split. And internationally, it was larger on the large quantity generator.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer & Company", "Similar to other international mix?", "Frank ten Brink", "Yes. So the international, we had more on LQ than we had on SQ.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer & Company", "Great. Has it generated about 80% or I think you said maybe 70%? It\u2019s similar to that, Frank?", "Frank ten Brink", "It\u2019s probably closer to the 70%.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer & Company", "Okay, thanks. And then one more if I could. The \u2013 well, two more, sorry. The RMS that you mentioned large in the quarter, a few large coming through the pipeline in the quarter, how much of that is going to persist into the second quarter?", "Frank ten Brink", "Again, it will continue to be a very uneven business. It\u2019s very unpredictable. Even for the second quarter, you don\u2019t have much visibility till the end of that quarter. So again it will remain an uneven business, but we are very proud of them, of the volumes and the momentum overall with FDA and consumer protection is favorable. The environment for that part is getting tighter. People are getting more fines. And all that facilitates a better environment for us on the recall side.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer & Company", "Okay, thanks. And then finally, you hadn\u2019t mentioned it in the previous question about gross margin, was energy impactful on the top \u2013 surcharges on the top or the gross margin line? Thanks.", "Frank ten Brink", "It was really immaterial in the quarter. So from that point, if you look at the fuel, we had higher fuel, but that was really offset by lower energy in the quarter. There was always a little bit of timing lag, but the year-over-year growth rates were not materially impacted.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer & Company", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason Rodgers from Great Lakes Review. Your line is now open.", "Jason Rodgers \u2013 Great Lakes Review", "Hi. My questions are basically answered. Just on the energy cost, what was the percent of sales in the quarter?", "Rich Kogler", "Percent was 5.3%.", "Jason Rodgers \u2013 Great Lakes Review", "Okay. That was it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman from Wunderlich Securities. Your line is now open.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Thank you. Good afternoon. When should we expect the 10-Q to be filed?", "Frank ten Brink", "The 10-Q will be filed probably around the 13th, 14th.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "May 13, 14. Okay. And then on the customers, the 465 breaks down 453 SQ, 12 large Q. Can you break that US/international for us?", "Frank ten Brink", "No, we don\u2019t break it international and domestic.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "On the Steri-Safe, what percent of your addressable customer base have you penetrated at this point?", "Frank ten Brink", "Little bit over 43% \u2013 43.9%. But that is just the domestic number. If you look at worldwide, it\u2019s only 31%.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Okay. So back to the other question, it would be helpful to understand that sort of what\u2019s the customer mix in those two markets on the small generators.", "Frank ten Brink", "I think there is a lot of opportunity left, because of the customers that are on the program, on the select and preferred, that\u2019s only 33.7% of those customers that we have on Steri-Safe. So again, Steri-Safe is a three-legged stool. New customers coming in, signing them up for the higher levels, existing customers to get them into and then they start at the entry level, and then up-sell them. And just for everyone\u2019s information, the up-selling is very powerful. So a premium level customer is almost six times more lucrative for us because we get about $700 maybe to a $1,000 more in revenues from them, whereas in entry level \u2013 for just the standard entry level for the training is maybe like $200, $250 more. So again, it\u2019s not just the people that are on the program, but then also the mix of people within the program. And there are opportunities on both sides to expand with customers that are not yet on domestic and international, as well as the up-selling, which is a huge opportunity for us though.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Fair enough. In the quarter, the cash from ops was pretty big on the benefit of working capital. Should we see some of that smoothing the working capital shift, or how much of that is permanent?", "Frank ten Brink", "Well, I\u2019m very proud of the team on the collection side. Obviously we had a very strong quarter also on the recall side. So that\u2019s where the receivable increase was. But the one day off again on DSO that continuously had been able to reduce that and will continue towards that, Michael. I don\u2019t think there is an end yet for that.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Okay. So if I understand that, clearly some of it is related to mix, but a piece of it is permanent.", "Frank ten Brink", "No, because the permanent part, if you have a recall that is very large, Michael, that obviously if you have a slow one in the next quarter, you\u2019re going to get that working capital come back to it.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Okay. And then on the acquired revenues, the $31 million for the contribution in 2010, can you give us a little better feel for the split between domestic and international so we get the model right?", "Frank ten Brink", "I think right now we are at about 24% in this quarter. So everything depends little bit on foreign exchange rate since if we now get a full quarter of the internationals to come in, it will eke up a little bit, maybe like to the 25%, but then it will depend, again the growth rates are not that dissimilar between the two. So it depends again on acquisitions, which we don\u2019t include in our guidance.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Right. And then on this continuous improvement program, is there a target G&A number you would like to be at?", "Frank ten Brink", "If you look at the overall SG&A, I think that\u2019s one that at the end of the year was the integration being completed. You really should look at kind of the mix 19% kind of range, and then it\u2019s going to come down a little bit from that, especially after the integration of MedServe is complete.", "Michael Hoffman \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Richard Skidmore from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Richard Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Good afternoon. Just a couple of follow-ups. First, on the Steri-Safe, can you talk to whether the pace of up-selling and your success rates are accelerating or decelerating?", "Rich Kogler", "I would say that they are acceleration because two reasons. One is obviously the sales force gains we experience every month that we continue to sell, and I think also the word is getting out that the program provides a very good value. And we kind of see that acceleration was a fact that over 80% of customers go right into the upper levels when they call in for new service.", "Richard Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And as a result of that, are you putting more labor towards that, or how should we think about the opportunity to really accelerate that going forward?", "Rich Kogler", "Well, we tend to follow the strategy of feeding het hard hand, which is why you will see our SG&A move around a little bit in terms of tens of percent. In this case, we are definitely making sure that we are fully staffed to take advantage of the experienced sales force that we have and the customer demand.", "Richard Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And then just if I might ask a couple of questions about acquisitions, just in terms of the pipeline that you see going forward, how would you categorize it? And then where do you \u2013 if you break it down into more subcategories in terms of size, geography, end markets that you're focused on, just help us understand a little bit better what you see out there on the acquisition front.", "Frank ten Brink", "I think the pipeline is definitely north of 50 million for the North American market and north of 100 million worldwide.", "Richard Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And is there a target for 2010 to come from acquisitions?", "Frank ten Brink", "No, we don\u2019t have targets. We do them when the deals are right.", "Richard Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And then have you closed any acquisitions in April?", "Frank ten Brink", "And we don\u2019t disclose until quarters are over.", "Richard Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason Rodgers from Great Lakes Review. Your line is now open.", "Jason Rodgers \u2013 Great Lakes Review", "Thanks for taking the follow-up. I was just wondering what your plans are for the MedServe\u2019s OSHA compliance program, if you're planning on continuing that or getting rid of it or what?", "Rich Kogler", "We are looking at that. That was probably an earlier question about some of those valuated programs that came over. They had a program that t emphasized the HIPAA compliance. Probably if I were looking out in my crystal ball, I would say that we would integrate the best of all the programs because that\u2019s what\u2019s going to be most desirable and attractive to our customers.", "Jason Rodgers \u2013 Great Lakes Review", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you.", "Mark Miller", "I thank everybody for your time and patience. And we look forward to having another great quarter when we talk in Q2. Take care, everyone.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Our lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.  ", "After the speakers\u2019 remarks there\u2019ll be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions).  ", "Thank you, Laura Murphy, VP of Corporate Finance. You may begin your conference.  ", "Laura Murphy ", "Welcome to Stericycle\u2019s Quarterly Conference Call.  Joining me on today\u2019s call will be Frank Ten Brink, CFO, Rich Kogler, COO and Matt Miller, Chairman and CEO.", "I will now read the Safe Harbor statement.

Factors described in the company's Form 10-K, 10-Q, as well as its other filings with the SEC could affect the company's actual results and could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from expected results. The company makes no commitment to disclose any revisions to forward-looking statements or any facts, events, or circumstances after this date that may bear upon forward-looking statements.", "I will now turn it over to Frank.", "Frank Ten Brink.", "Thank you.  The results for the second quarter are as follows.  Revenues grew $58.5 million to $347.7 million up 20.2% from $289 million in the second quarter of 09.  Domestic internal growth excluding returns management was up 8.1% and international internal growth adjusted forex change was up 9.4%.  Domestic internal growth consists of SQ of 9% and large quantity of 6%.   Regulated recalls and returns management services revenues were $25.4 million.  ", "The gross profit was $161.5 million or 46.5% of revenues.  Excluding the regulator returns management services restructuring costs, the gross margin would have been 46.7%", "SG&A expense was $67.3 million or 19.3% of revenues.  Net interest expense was $8.8 million and net income attributable to Stericycle was $53.1 million or $0.61 per share on an as-reported basis and $0.62 adjusted for after-tax transaction expenses related to various non operating items.", "At the end of the quarter the revolver borrowings were approximately $359 million which is floating at LIBOR plus 75 basis points.  The unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $297 million.", "On July 16th, 2010, we received informal commitments from 22 institutional investors to purchase $175 million of min 3.89% seven-year unsecured senior notes and $225 million of new ten-year 4.47% on secured senior notes.  We anticipate that the note purchase agreement will be signed in August of 2010 and that the new senior notes will be issued in October, 2010.  The proceeds of this new agreement will be used to repay return debts and a portion of the revolver.  ", "We repurchased 235,436 shares of common stock on the open market in an amount of $13 million in the quarter.  Cumulatively we have purchased approximately 13.6 million shares and we still have authorization to purchase an additional 2.6 million shares.  ", "The capital spending in the quarter was $12.2 million, our DSO was 51 days and the cash provided from operations was $129.3 for the first six months of 2010.", "And I will now turn it over to Rich.", "Richard T. Kogler", "", "Thanks Frank.  At the end of the quarter we had over 471,000 accounts of which approximately 459,000 were small and 12,000 were large.  We continue to see strong growth across all geographies fuelled by new customers and a continued adoption of our value added services.", "Let me quote the worldwide growth opportunity in the context for you.  With our large quantity customers we now have multiple service offerings which can potentially triple the value of each account.  Today less than 20% of LQ customers are using multiple services leaving more than 80% of our LQ customer base available for growth by adding services such as Sharps Management and RX Waste.  ", "Likewise, with our small quantity customers we offer multiple services which can also triple the value of each account.  Today approximately a third of our SQ customers utilize multiple services leaving two-thirds of our customer base available for growth by adding services like Steri-Safe clinical services and RX Waste.", "We\u2019re particularly excited about the recently launched RX Waste program for our domestic large and small customers.  This program is now rolled out across the entire U.S. and is also available in a number of our international geographies. We\u2019re getting favorable feedback from customers about our unique in-service capability which helps them stay compliant.", "In closing we want to thank each member of our worldwide team for their solid performance and continued commitment to our customers and our shareholders.", "I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark.", "Mark C. Miller ", "Thanks, Rich. I\u2019d now like to provide insight on our current outlook for 2010. And please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements. At the end of the second quarter we completed four acquisitions; two domestic and two international.  The analyzed revenues of these four acquisitions is approximately $12 million.  Now keep in mind our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures of the related transaction expenses, but our guidance does include these items for the transactions already closed.", "We believe analysts EPS estimates will be in the range of $2.42 to $2.46 which we are comfortable with.  We believe analyst\u2019s revenue estimates for 2010 will be in the range of $1.37 billion to $1.39 billion depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange.", "We believe analysts will have estimates for net income between $210 million and $213 million depending on assumptions for margin improvement and interest expense.  And we believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow of between $245 million and $255 million with capital expenditures anticipated between $45 million to $50 million.", "In closing, we are very excited about the tremendous growth opportunities in 2010 and beyond. We thank you for listening to our prepared comments. And the operator will now turn it over to the Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Jonathan Ellis of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Thank you; just\u2026let\u2019s get a couple of housekeeping questions out there as first as we could.  Just total number of Steri-Safe accounts as at the end of the quarter percentage on higher levels and then Steri-Safe as a percentage of SQ revenue please?", "Mark Miller", "Yes as we said before we\u2019re looking at about a third of\u2026yeah, about a third are using multiple services so we\u2019re probably in the neighborhood of 145,000 to 150,000 accounts.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay and how many of those, to be clear though, how many of those are actually on the higher level?", "Frank ten Brink", "About 11% of the total.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "11% of the total, okay. And then total Steri-Safe as a percentage of SQ revenue this quarter?", "Mark Miller", "Total percent of domestic revenue is about 71%; that\u2019s domestic only.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great.  And then just on the\u2026the LQ side can you provide us with the number of new LQ contracts and Bio-systems accounts during the quarter?", "Mark Miller", "58 new medical waste contracts, 75 Bio-systems domestic.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great.  And can you just talk a little bit about the\u2026the returns business I know there were a number of projects this quarter, can you help us to understand how any of those projects are going to continue into the third quarter and any revision to the full year guidance for the returns business?", "Mark Miller", "For our full-year guidance we\u2019re expecting right now about approximately $85 million to $90 million. What we\u2019re seeing as regards through the share is a number of fairly sizable events that extend over multiple months.  We\u2019re also seeing a really good increase in the awareness of our capabilities and we think that will [bottle off] for us.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "And to be clear any of the projects that have been ongoing, would you expect them to continue into the third quarter or at this point it's a matter of waiting on new projects to materialize?", "Rich Kogler", "Each project can often extend over multiple quarters; it depends on the scope of the activities, what\u2019s requested so it's not uncommon for even small projects to extend over multiple quarters.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay.  And then just on the RX business you have a thousand opportunities and I know in the past you talked about how that program could take multiple forms.  Based on your success this far can you give us some sense for how customers are choosing?  Are they using you to basically manage all the waste streams sort of holistically or are you just being contracted to dispose off the pharmaceutical waste exclusively?  Can you give us a sense of what the nature most of the agreements are thus far?", "Mark Miller", "Well the pharmaceutical waste program is to handle pharmaceutical products and we think that the opportunity right now could be a couple of hundred million or higher depending on how the program is received. It's compliance-driven, we make it easy for the customers, I said in my remarks and our unique in-service model means that we basically take over the hard work for the customer, making it easy for them to stay in compliance.    ", "There are good gross margins in both the LQ and SQ space and right now we\u2019re\u2026frankly we\u2019re seeing very good acceptance as we roll it out.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, I\u2019m sorry\u2026just to be clear though are most of the interest in RX in conjunction with your universal solutions as well or thus far most of the contracts you\u2019re signing are just exclusively for RX?", "Mark Miller", "Am I not really understanding your question?  The universal waste solution, don\u2019t know exactly what you meant by that.", " Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Where you\u2019re tasked by a hospital or a small quantity generator but more so a hospital to manage all of their waste streams, including pharmaceuticals\u2026", "Mark Miller", "You\u2019re talking about something called bundling.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Correct.", "Mark Miller", "Yeah, you know bundling is really not a new market issue; it's something that\u2019s probably been out there for over 20 years.  Some of the solid waste companies have tried, it hasn\u2019t worked all that well.  Probably today, less than 0.5%, half of 1% of our LQ customers are interested in the service or receiving it.  Where we\u2019re called in to make that kind of proposal generally four out of five of the customers choose us over a competitor but again that is not really the RX program that I was referring to.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "I see, okay.  And then just answer very quickly and then I\u2019ll get back in cue, the free cash flow guidance for the year you didn\u2019t change that even though you raised the net income outlook.  Just help us understand what the factor is driving that are?", "Frank ten Brink", "It\u2019s a little bit through there are some expenses that will go up a little bit.  I think it's really arranged the $245 to $255 million then maybe a little bit of room that we will probably conserve at the fair but overall we thought it was within the range. ", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay and then just my final question; the tax rate this quarter was\u2026seemed to be fairly low, any guidance on what tax rate should be for the balance of the year?", "Frank ten Brink", "Sure.  Year to date is what you need to keep looking at because that kind of steps the race and that kind of in the mid to high 36s.  We would say the forecast for the year is pretty similar, mid to high 36s.", "Jonathan Ellis \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Great, thanks guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels of William Blair. Your line is open.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Good afternoon guys.  I just want to start with a quick follow-up on the RX Waste Compliance Program, sounds like one you\u2019ve rolled that out across the U.S and you\u2019re seeing good demand.  I\u2019m curious if that demand is pervasive across all the states you\u2019re in or are you seeing more initial demand in those markets where the compliance and regulations are a little bit tighter?  Any color there?", "Mark Miller", "Certainly it's regulatory driven but in\u2026for example like take our EPA region is forecasting heavy enforcements we\u2019ll see a lot more customers coming to us but I would say that we\u2019re seeing interest in all geographies that\u2019s why we rolled it out across the country as quickly as we could.  And a lot of customers are looking at it as the green initiative\u2026waste shouldn\u2019t be put down the drain and they\u2019re also saying well, if you can do it as an in-service model like bio-systems model where really the labor component is done by Stericycle that\u2019s a benefit to them.  So think we\u2019re seeing more interest in it besides just, \u201cOh I got to do this to comply.\u201d", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Okay, perfect.  And then a little bit of change of topic but on the MedServe transaction, I know you thought you might be done with most of the integrations in the July-August timeframe, I\u2019m curious one, if we can get an update there on how that\u2019s progressing?  And number two just relative to your prior financial forecast what the current view is?", "Richard Kogler", "Yeah, I mean the integration is on track according to our original projections the two pennies are included in the guidance and those two pennies have been kind of our consistent view of what will happen when it's fully integrated.  I think most of you are aware that we sold the business in the Heartlands area and that was closed and done and\u2026we closed one redundant location and right now we\u2019re pretty much on track to finish up that integration.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Okay, great.  And then it doesn\u2019t appear in [tape recorder] at all but I\u2019m curious with all the austerity measures overseas especially throughout Europe if you guys are seeing any pressure or head winds in that business have you sailing through that pretty much unscathed?", "Mark Miller ", "Yeah, we have not experienced the effects of the austerity measures.  Historically the healthcare budgets are not getting impacted, I think there is\u2026we are seeing the effects on acquisition opportunities where in some cases there is a little bit less competition on deals surprising as favorable and some discussion in the UK has been put forward about modifying the health system but that\u2019s going to go through a lot more public debate and reversions before we see that.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Okay and then I guess final question just looking at your organic growth rate at recall, I think domestically it\u2019s gone from 6% Q4 to 7 and now 8%, international from5 to 7 to 9.4. So is there anything in particular there that\u2019s driving the nice re-acceleration and growth over the last few quarters or is it just the new product launches or is just stable continuing demand? Any color there would be helpful.", "Frank ten Brink", "I think it\u2019s multiple things. One is the adding of the multiple services we have, the rolling out and expansion of SQ internationally is part of that. You really have a focus that due surcharged is not as much of a factor any more so the year over year kind of factors that impact that are not there any more so you\u2019re seeing more the true effect of what these multiple services are doing.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Okay great, thanks a lot for the color guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Levine, JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Scott Levine \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.", "Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Question, drilling down on the organic growth, if we look at your domestic SQ&L queue, your SQ\u2019s kind of remain stable at 80% radar thereabouts [indiscernible] uptake this quarter but your LQ has gone from this 3% range in the second half of last year to 5 and now 6, is there anything with regard to the RX or any other variables really driving that or you\u2019re seeing increased penetration of hospitals or pricing or, elaborate a little further on the accelerating trend there.", "Rich Kogler", "Yeah I think Frank just alluded to, we have multiple service offerings now. We have the bio-systems which has continued to have strong acceptance. I mean it\u2019s a program we\u2019ve had out there for some time although there\u2019s still plenty of runway left there. The RX is coming on strong; obviously there is a green mentality that I think is permeating the country in the last 12, 18 months which is helping us.", "There is focus on trying to utilize labor in the hospitals more efficiently, that\u2019s helping us and I think his point about this being a period of time where we don\u2019t really have something involving the fuel distorting the growth rate. You\u2019re looking at really sort of a true growth rate now and you\u2019re seeing things in LQ reflecting these new services being rolled out.", "Scott Levine \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.", "Got it and then does your guidance content play the note issue and the increased borrowing costs beginning I guess beginning of Q4? Is that factored in the guidance?", "Frank ten Brink", "Yes, that is factored and starting Q4 you will have about 1.2 cents diluted impact because of the higher interest rates if you assume that LIBOR remains the same as to what it is right now for next year that will probably between $0.5 to $0.6 impact. We\u2019re really taking advantage here of the low fixed rates and the diversification of our capital structure and obviously has a good funding for us for growth. The rates obviously when we did them we were the lowest rate at that point issued in the year even including investment grade hired and we were the lowest rate and obviously 7 and 10 year money was clearly very good and well oversubscribed by about 6 times.", "Scott Levine \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.", "Got it, now it makes sense. One follow up on acquisitions, can you tell us which geographies internationals were in and maybe an update on the pipeline and multiples paid in the market?", "Frank ten Brink", "Yeah so there were two domestic, two international, one was in Mexico, one was in the UK, there were tuck-in acquisitions as Mark said, annual revenues about 12 million, revenues in the quarter itself were about 1.5 million, the multiple very similar to what we paid before, between 6 and 7 but 70% of the revs were with large quantity.", "From a pipeline point of view it\u2019s north of 100 million and increasing, it\u2019s both domestic and international.", "Scott Levine \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger, Oppenheimer. Your line is open.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer.", "", "Thanks, good afternoon. Frank could you just repeat what percentage was LQG, SQG, I mean new acquisitions?", "Frank ten Brink", "", "It was 70% LQ.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer.", "Thanks. The \u2013 I guess while we\u2019re on that theme, could you give us an update. You were very inquisitive last quarter how those are progressing and any impact on the margin in this quarter.", "Frank ten Brink", "", "Yeah, the acquisitions we concluded last quarter are all on track, the larger one there as everyone remembers was Brazil. Great team, they clearly are on track, we see lots of growth and deal opportunity in Brazil. So we\u2019re very excited about the adding of that country into the total, but all the other ones are working the way they should", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer.", "", "Ok then the gross margins down year over year I assume that was primarily MedServe, please correct if I\u2019m wrong, how much was it on RMS contribution, what were other components that would move it up or down year over year? Thanks.", "Frank ten Brink", "If you look to year over year quarter, you\u2019re down about 50 basis points, if you look at an adjusted excluding the restructuring for the RMS, so it went from 47 2 to 46 7. About 100 basis points of that is acquisition related, the biggest one of that was Netsurf related, energy and fuel was a negative, about 50 basis points and then all the other factors, the improvements in the business and growing the higher margin sectors faster was an add of about 100 basis points. So it netted out a negative 50 still but because of mostly acquisitions in energy.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer.", "Okay thanks. Are you guys at a point now where you\u2019re national with our RX Waste that you can give us an idea of what type of revenue magnitude that is?", "Rich Kogler", "Well I guess we have rolled it out in all geographies and we believe the opportunity is a couple of 100 million or could be higher. We\u2019re pretty excited about it right now.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer.", "Sure. Obviously not big enough to disclose, at what point would it be big enough to disclose?", "Frank ten Brink", "It will stay included into the SQ/LQ. So if both sectors are being impacted to serve, this is also performed by overlapping parts of the infrastructure, so some of it will be difficult to separate. Most likely you\u2019ll continue to see it as part of SQ/LQ in their growth rates.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer.", "Ok thanks and now with \u2013 you mentioned in the prepared remarks a good quarter for recall at RMS and good awareness out there. Could you speak to your spend? I assume predominantly in SG&A with regard to that are you going to put the pedal on the metal or pull back now you feel you\u2019ve hit a level where you have enough awareness?", "Frank ten Brink", "If you look at our SG&A over the last couple of quarters and if you exclude for instance stock options, amortization and any of the restructuring, you\u2019ve seen Q4 at about 18%, Q1 at about 18% and then a slight drop in Q2 17.6%. We would say including all those factors, you\u2019re still looking at mid to low 19s but we\u2019re clearly \u2013 as we start also with the integration of Netsurf we\u2019re starting to see a little bit of that benefit now and those are the kind of things that should lower the little bit and for the year again mid to low 19s including the factors like stock options and amortization.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer.", "Ok thanks very much.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of David Manthey, Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.", "David Manthey \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Hi guys, good afternoon. There were several seemingly large recalls announced somewhat late in the quarter, McDonald and Maytag and Kellogg\u2019s and a whole bunch of things, I\u2019m just wondering, when you look at the first half it seemed like as far as I can tell was your highest returns half ever and I\u2019m just wondering the 85 to 90 seems a little light. Is there a lack of visibility of which you\u2019re working on now? It sounded like things are going well, I\u2019m just wondering why, are you just being conservative there?", "Frank ten Brink", "", "It remains an uneven market and it is one where we probably were overestimating when we started last year. From that point of view \u2013 but it remains uneven and unknown, we don\u2019t know yet what\u2019s going to come out in the months to come and so we have to be on that part, not necessarily conservative but just what we think as realistic and remember too that even though recall is done, it really depends what we do for it. Is it done all the way to the consumer level or not? One recall can as a result be $5 million and the other one can be $100,000. So again quantity of recalls is not the guidance that would drive our revenues, it\u2019s our interaction and the quantity of work that we do for a customer.", "But it will remain uneven and I wouldn\u2019t say if it\u2019s conservative or aggressive, it\u2019s just what we think right now we can look at and then feel comfortable with telling.", "David Manthey \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "As it relates to your increased awareness that would indicate to me that you\u2019re seeing more opportunities. Is your win rate within those opportunities also increasing?", "Frank ten Brink", "I think definitely the awareness campaign is working, the government also is putting on more pressure and all those combined I think are positive environments for us.", "David Manthey \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Lastly, can you just give me an idea right now where you stand in terms of the mix of small quantity versus large quantity, if you were to break out US and international separately?", "Frank ten Brink", "", "I think numbers we\u2019ve given in the past is roughly similar, you\u2019re talking 63% of US is about small, internationally what we\u2019ve indicated and for instance the UK, we\u2019re now at approximately 30%. Those are some of the ratios that we\u2019ve given and what it is right now. ", "David Manthey \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "(Operator instructions). Your next question comes from the line of Richard Skidmore, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Richard Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Good afternoon. Just one question specifically about Steri-Safe, if I look back over the last few quarters here, percent of SQ customers on Steri-Safe has stayed around one third, I believe in the past couple of conference calls you\u2019ve talked about the sales force being better adept at increasing the Steri-Safe subscribers. Can you just talk about the progress and when you might see that percentage accelerate, more quantity customers on Steri-Safe or what might be keeping that from really growing?", "", "Mark Miller", "Yeah I think what you\u2019re seeing is actually that the customer base, the target base of customers who can be offered continues to increase. So it\u2019s not really a factor of the sales people have plateaued. Sales people actually have gotten very adept over time at bringing people into Steri-Safe and into the higher level programs. But what you do see is through acquisitions, through new account capture of transactional business, we continue to add to the pool of customers and that\u2019s why I said on account of a worldwide basis, we still have two thirds of our customer base, small quantity customer base available for growth.", "Richard Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And can you just reconcile that with I think previous comment maybe not this quarter but in prior quarters where the new small quantity customers roughly 80% were taking Steri-Safe and maybe just reconcile that with your previous comment?", "Frank ten Brink", "And that\u2019s still the same. In the quarter itself we were still over 80% at sign up for the higher levels.", "Richard Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Richard Close, Jefferies & Company. Your line is open.", "Sean Sullivan - Jefferies & Company", "Good afternoon, this is Sean [indiscernible] Rich Close. I want to start with just kind of touching on the internal growth rates and what\u2019s possible been driving them. Have you guys \u2013 has there been any recent changes in the size or composition of your sales force and or marketing spend recently?", "Frank ten Brink", "", "No, there hasn\u2019t been. I mean it\u2019s fairly stable. I mean obviously we do invest into the areas of our business where we have great returns like Steri-Safe now obviously and the RX Waste market sector. So there is emphasis on that in investments, that\u2019s fair. But they have shown and continue to show very good results and again it\u2019s contributing to the growth and our revenues.", "Sean Sullivan - Jefferies & Company", "Okay and what percentage approximately of your large quantity contracts are volume based or actually based on the way you collect I guess given kind of the lower utilization hospitals that we\u2019ve heard a lot of these guys report lately, is that having any impact or do you anticipate to have an impact on your business?", "Frank ten Brink", "", "Yeah, this question has come up over the years obviously especially in recessionary kind of environments and how does volume really impact us? And it\u2019s very different from country to country because volume could impact it if you think about it because of down economy. But then in countries where there is national health care and the like, that\u2019s not really an impact.", "So if you look overall to all the recessions now that have been here at, we have not seen an impact on our volumes and as we\u2019ve indicated before. So this again is an industry that\u2019s insulated it seems from the economic up and downs. There is probably slightly less volume growth in large quantity because they keep losing it to the outpatient centers and the like.", "So it\u2019s more volume growth in the outpatient and the small customers. What\u2019s driving industry growth is the baby boom, what\u2019s driving it is more regulatory frameworks like Pharma is also being driven by regulatory framework. Those are very positive for us and overall the percent of business that really gets bill based on volume is not that high.", "Steri-Safe is a fixed monthly fee with overages, the remainder of the customers that are small are billed by the container and so the weight and the container is really not a driver of the amount of revenues. If you look at large customers, they may be volume driven both on the container or a per pound basis but also the programs such the RX Waste and even Bio charts are fixed monthly fees.", "So again all those combined make the percentage of business that\u2019s volume driven not that high.", "Sean Sullivan - Jefferies & Company", "Alright, thank you.", "", "Operator", "", "There are no further questions in queue at this time.", "Mark Miller", "Well we thank everybody for their time and attention today. We look forward to speaking with you again in the next quarter with another set of great results. Have a great day.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Baird and Company", "", "Operator", "Good afternoon, my name is Danny and I will be your conference operator today.", "At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). ", "Vice President of Corporate Finance, Laura Murphy, you may begin your conference. ", "", "Laura Murphy", "Welcome to Stericycle\u2019s quarterly conference call. Joining me on today\u2019s call will be Frank Ten Brink, CFO; Rich Kogler, COO and Mark Miller, Chairman and CEO.", "I will now read the Safe Harbor statement. Statements by Stericycle in this conference call that are not strictly historical are forward looking. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, and should be viewed with caution. Factors described in the company's Form 10-K, 10-Q, as well as its other filings with the SEC could affect the company's actual results and could have caused the company's actual results to materially differ from expected results. ", "The company makes no commitment to disclose any revisions to forward-looking statements or any facts, events or circumstances after this date that may bear upon forward-looking statements.", "I will now turn it over to Frank.", "Frank Ten Brink", "Thanks Laura. The results for the third quarter are as follows. Revenues grew $65.2 million to $363 million, up 21.9% from $297.8 million in the third quarter of \u201809. Revenues grew 22.4% when adjusted for the unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $1.6 million.", "Domestic internal growth excluding returns management was up 8.4% and international internal growth adjusted foreign exchange was up approximately 6%. Domestic internal growth consisted of SQ of 10% and large quantity of 6%. Regulated recalls and returns management services revenues were $31.9 million. ", "Gross profit was $168.1 million or 46.3% of revenues excluding the regulated returns management services restructuring costs, the gross margin would have been 46.4%.", "SG&A expense was $69.4 million or 19.1% of revenues and net interest expense was $8.4 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $56.7 million or $0.65 per share on an as-reported and adjusted basis.", "At the end of the quarter, the revolver borrowings were approximately $375 million which is floating at LIBOR plus 75 basis points. The unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $290 million.", "On October 15, we received 400 million private placements. The proceeds were used to repay 100 million of the term debt and 300 million of the revolver.", "We repurchased 308,588 shares of common stock on the open market in an amount of 19.3 million in the quarter. Capital spending was $10.9 million and our DSO in the quarter was 53 days. Finally, the cash provided from operations was $205.4 million for the first nine months of 2010.", "And I will now turn it over to Rich.", "Richard T. Kogler", "Thanks, Frank. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 476,000 accounts of which approximately 463,500 were small and the remainder were large. We continue to see strong growth worldwide, driven by new account acquisition and the adoption of our expanding portfolio of service offerings.", "With our large quantity customers, we have multiple service offerings which add to the value of each account, and today less than 20% of our LQ customers are using our multiple services, leaving more than 80% of our LQ customer base available for growth. Likewise, with our small quantity customers, we offer multiple services that increase the value of an account. Today, approximately a third of our SQ customers utilize our multiple services, leaving two thirds of our customer base available for growth.", "We do remain excited about the recently launched Rx Waste program for our domestic large and small customers, and we continue to receive favorable feedback from customers about our unique in-service capability, which helps them stay compliant.", "In closing, we want to thank each member of our worldwide team for their solid performance and continued commitment to our customers and our shareholders.", "I will turn it over to Mark.", "Mark C. Miller", "Thanks, Rich. I\u2019d now like to provide insight on our current outlook for 2010 and preliminary outlook for 2011. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements.", "At the end of the third quarter, we completed six acquisitions, three domestic and three international. The annualized revenue of these six acquisitions is approximately $18 million.", "Keep in mind our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures and related transaction expenses, but our guidance does include those items for transactions that are closed.", "For 2010, we believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $2.45 and $2.46, based on an as-reported GAAP EPS for the first three quarters of the year, and we\u2019re comfortable with this range. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2010 will be in the range of 1.4 billion to 1.41 billion, depending on assumptions for growth rate in foreign exchange. And we believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow of 241 million to 243 million with capital expenditures anticipated between $46 million and $47 million for the year.", "Now, I would like to provide a preliminary outlook for 2011. We believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $2.71 to $2.76, which we are comfortable with. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2011 will be in the range of $1.49 billion to $1.52 billion, depending upon assumptions for growth and foreign exchange. And we believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow between $270 million and $275 million with capital expenditure expenses between $45 million and $55 million.", "In closing, we are very excited about the tremendous growth we've achieved and opportunities in 2010 and beyond. And we thank you for your time on the prepared comments. And operator, we'll now go to Q&A mode.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels from William Blair; your line is now open.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "", "Yes, guys, good afternoon. Just a quick question on the 2010 guidance. I want to make sure I have it correctly. What you are providing is a range of 2.45 to 2.46 is on the GAAP basis, which I believe is running about $0.02 lower than your pro forma numbers. Is that right?", "Mark Miller", "That\u2019s correct. It\u2019s in fact $0.01 roughly; year-to-date is the difference between the two.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "", "Okay, so pretty similar. And then secondly, do you guys have any update on the healthcare waste deal, maybe anticipated closing date on that? And I\u2019m curious if the fact that you went through the MedServe Hart-Scott-Rodino review gives you more confidence that can close a little bit quicker, potentially?", "Richard Kogler", "Well, where we stand right now is that both companies have filed their HSR notification with the DOJ, and that just took place a couple weeks ago. DOJ, as you know, has 30 days to review the information and they request additional information. Closing, of course, depends on the DOJ information request. As far as the second part of your question, we do think it\u2019s a benefit that the DOJ is up to speed on the industry, but beyond that, really the timetable is in their hands.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "", "Okay. Great. And then any more color on the M&A front, kind of pipeline? I\u2019m curious if at least domestically you guys are seeing more activity as sellers rush to try to complete deals ahead of what could be a change in capital gains taxes at the end of 2010.", "Frank Ten Brink", "Yes, so the pipeline is over $100 million in revenues worldwide in multiple geographies. It\u2019s very robust. We do see a little bit of a pickup as a result of people wanting to maybe close before year-end. But I would say that people coming to the table, mom and pops aren\u2019t necessarily looking for that to be the starter, but once in the game then they may be want to speed it up.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "", "Okay. And then last question and I\u2019ll hop off. Just a little more color on the deals that were done. I think you said three international. Can you give us the markets there and then maybe talk a little bit about anything unique or what the business mix is? Thanks.", "Frank Ten Brink", "Yes. So the three in the US market were in regulated waste, and the three international, one was in Portugal and two were in Japan.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ellis from Bank of America, your line is now open.", "Jonathan Ellis - Bank of America", "Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe just go through some of the longevity questions first. The Steri-Safe as a percentage of SQ revenue?", "Richard Kogler", "It\u2019s over 71%.", "Jonathan Ellis - Bank of America", "Okay. And then total number of Steri-Safe accounts and percentage on higher levels?", "Richard Kogler", "We\u2019re over 147,000 total, and the percent on the higher level worldwide is about \u2013 it\u2019s over 11% now.", "Jonathan Ellis - Bank of America", "Over 11%. Okay.", "Richard Kogler", "", "Just as an aside too, if I can Jonathan, because I guess I wanted to say this, both to folks like yourself who have been following the company for awhile, but also people who are new to the company. I think you all know we continue to invest, so we can add and expand service offerings for LQ and SQ customers. Our current menu, as I mentioned, gives us the potential to triple customer revenues. And we\u2019ve seen similar behavior over the years from customers who go to the menu and they sort of customize what meets their needs.", "And as we\u2019ve moved into international geographies and also as we got multiple service offerings and we continue to expand on that, we\u2019ve kind of found that these legacy metrics related to, say one service offering like Steri-Safe or acquisition of med waste accounts or something really become less relevant for us. So we don\u2019t really focus on them internally. ", "We look at growth in our business sectors, and so I guess I just wanted to make that point for people who are trying to model us that we think, and we kind of tell our team that the important thing is to look at the growth in the space and not necessarily get tied up in number of accounts here or there.", "Jonathan Ellis - Bank of America", "Sure. Understood. I guess until you give us an alternative metric to chit to, to look at, though this is the best we have for now.", "Richard Kogler", "", "I just want to make it clear that it may not be the best way to model the company. And so\u2026", "Jonathan Ellis - Bank of America", "Fair enough.", "Richard Kogler", "For someone who\u2019s just starting to follow us, they probably need to focus on growth rates because that is the metric that we use.", "Jonathan Ellis - Bank of America", "Understood, and I appreciate that. Just one clarifying point on the accounts on higher Steri-Safe levels. If my numbers are correct, over the past few quarters, it\u2019s been running about a third. And I think if I heard you correctly, you said more than 11% now?", "Richard Kogler", "Did you ask for the total percentage of accounts who are on Steri-Safe? You said you wanted the percentage of the accounts.", "", "Jonathan Ellis - Bank of America", "No, no. On higher levels, I\u2019m sorry, on higher levels.", "Mark Miller", "Again, the number on a domestic basis is about 35.1%. But again, John, what we\u2019re saying is that the people that worldwide are on higher levels is 11%.", "Jonathan Ellis - Bank of America", "Okay. So that\u2019s a new denominator. Understood.", "Mark Miller", "That\u2019s correct.", "Jonathan Ellis - Bank of America", "Okay.", "Mark Miller", "And so that\u2019s why, again, you need to look at it more worldwide with clinical services now having been introduced in the UK, Ireland and getting spread.", "Jonathan Ellis - Bank of America", "Okay. Got you. Good. And then the new accounts set up for higher levels of Steri-Safe, is that still over 80%?", "Richard Kogler", "It\u2019s run about 75% to 80%, yes, in that range. It hasn\u2019t changed.", "Jonathan Ellis - Bank of America", "Okay. And then just finally, total number of new LQ contracts and Bio Systems accounts?", "Richard Kogler", "Sure, 56 and 74 Bio Systems.", "Jonathan Ellis - Bank of America", "Okay, great. Okay, perfect. Just on the returns management business, based on the third quarter, do you have an updated guidance for this year and any guidance for next year for that business?", "Frank Ten Brink", "So the guidance for this year is between 104 to 110 and for next year it\u2019s 75 to 90, that\u2019s $1 million per year.", "Jonathan Ellis - Bank of America", "Okay, great. And then just on the energy costs, do you have that number for the quarter, fueled energy as a percent of revenue?", "Frank Ten Brink", "It was 5.2% for energy as a percent of revenue.", "Jonathan Ellis - Bank of America", "Okay. So Frank, can you help us understand, but I think that\u2019s pretty comparable to last quarter, and the gross margin decelerated about 30 basis points. Help us understand what some of the moving factors were that may have influenced gross margins this quarter versus last quarter?", "Frank Ten Brink", "Sure, so if you adjust already for the restructuring, it\u2019s been 30 basis points. Mix predominantly driven by the returns management side, impacted it negatively by 32 basis points. The acquisitions in the quarter was about 18 basis points, and then predominantly foreign exchange, a little bit of fuel, but mostly foreign exchange was five. So those were all headwinds of about 55 basis points and then the rest at about 25 basis points better.", "Jonathan Ellis - Bank of America", "Okay. Got you. Okay, good. The cash on the balance sheet built up somewhat this quarter, any explanation there or color?", "Frank Ten Brink", "No, it can fluctuate. Obviously, we at times do have cash related to our returns business, so that can fluctuate based on the business. But predominantly, we try to use cash to reduce debt as fast as we can.", "Jonathan Ellis - Bank of America", "Okay. And the pickup in receivables, is that also tied to recall or returns projects?", "Frank ten Brink", "Yes. It\u2019s really the timing of revenue and acquisitions in the quarter that kind of make DSO go up a little bit.", "Jonathan Ellis - Bank of America", "Okay. I see. Okay, great. And then just, if I may, on the acquisitions in Japan, my understanding is that the market is more separated out, collection and treatment are done by different companies. Can you help us understand the types of companies that you acquired in that market?", "Richard Kogler", "Yes. We bought two companies that combined both the transportation and treatment, and you\u2019re correct, the marketplace is very, very granular. Most of the companies are either dedicated in treatment or transportation, and we saw an opportunity to begin the learning process of integrating and providing a totally integrated service directly to the customer for that marketplace. So, excited about the new entry and a big opportunity over the long haul.", "Jonathan Ellis - Bank of America", "Okay. So to be clear, these are integrated companies and most of the acquisition candidates in Japan are still very much fragmented or carved out based on treatment versus transportation?", "Richard Kogler", "Yes.", "Jonathan Ellis - Bank of America", "Okay. Great. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk from Wedbush Securities, your line is now open. ", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities ", "Good afternoon guys.", "Mark Miller", "Good afternoon.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities ", "Just to clarify or follow up on the acquisition, and I realized it\u2019s small, so please appreciate where this is originating from. But is that in any way a change, or just an opportunity that you\u2019re taking advantage of? Because I thought historically you talked about more looking at platforms in the international markets and then building around those versus this sounded maybe a little bit more niche oriented?", "Mark Miller", "The Japan entry \u2013 we\u2019ve been watching and looking at Japan since the early \u201890s. The marketplace was never one that had a single leading player, and over that time hasn\u2019t evolved that way. ", "There\u2019s literally close to 1,000 entities that service the space. What we were looking for is entities that had customers, good leadership teams, infrastructure to combine and provide the combined growth platform and provide an integrated service to the customers, so that we can begin to see how the impact of that on the market dynamics are, and whether there\u2019s ability to continue that model throughout Japan in the future.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities ", "Okay. And then on the six acquisitions, I think it was $18 million of revenue, was any one of them a greater contributor to that number?", "Mark Miller", "Both in Japan were a larger part of that. The combination of the two.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities ", "And then finally, if I just may add, could you add a little bit of color on the dynamics on the 10% growth in SQ and 6% growth in LQ, which I think are at opposite ends of the range of growth? And are these the particular growth rates that we \u2013 are you suggesting that we look at as we try to calibrate the new business or the company with our financial models?", "Frank Ten Brink", "Yes. If you look at the growth rates overall that we give and have given for this year and for next year, it\u2019s very similar. SQ for next year and this year 8% to 10%, LQ 5% to 8%. As I mentioned already, the returns management, 75 million to 90 million, and then the international market 5% to 8%. So this was a good quarter and we\u2019re excited about it. But overall, these are the ranges that we feel are the right ranges to use.", "", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities ", "Alright. And not to split hairs, Frank, but was there just a higher conversion on the SQ this quarter or what\u2026?", "Frank Ten Brink", "No, I think overall all engines work. Again, you\u2019re talking about customers with additional services. So the multi-service picture that we have is really continuously what we have built on, and that facilitates the growth.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities ", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Levine from JPMorgan, your line is now open.", "Scott Levine \u2013 JPMorgan", "It\u2019s Scott Levine from JPMorgan. A question regarding the Rx Waste. For 2011, I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re not quantifying a target there, it\u2019s kind of embedded within your growth targets. But can you talk maybe quantitatively or qualitatively if that\u2019s true in terms of what your expectations are? Are you in full commercial rollout? Are there regulatory catalysts that we should look for to drive that business? Any thoughts to kind of guide expectations regarding Rx Waste in 2011 and beyond?", "Richard Kogler", "We are in full rollout mode for LQ and SQ. You\u2019re correct that we don\u2019t provide metrics in that sort of thing. That growth is embedded in the overall LQ growth and that\u2019s kind of how our people look at it and measure it. We\u2019re less concerned about whether they sell one account or three accounts or two accounts. But we are seeing very strong adoption in all markets.", "Scott Levine \u2013 JPMorgan", "And in terms of the importance of national regulation versus, I think there have been some developments at the state level, are there important catalysts to think about or look to on that front, or is that really not terribly important in your view?", "Richard Kogler", "In our view, it\u2019s doing fine right now. I think we see two drivers. One is the regulatory driver. The other really is just do the right thing driver. Everybody is sensitive these days to doing things, so our model, which basically makes it easy for the hospitals, because we do in-service, we take the labor and that component out of their hands, and the fact that we can put them in compliance and we can do it efficiently, relatively, economically. I mean, they end up doing the right thing. But the real driver is sort of the total model, the in-service piece.", "Scott Levine \u2013 JPMorgan", "Understood. And then turning to the returns business, I believe you don\u2019t break out, call it the recall business from the returns side. But when you look at the guidance you provided, say for next year, this year obviously is an active year for recall, 75 to 90 million versus the traditional 75 to 90, is the mix between the two expected to be materially different than what it\u2019s been in the past or is it kind of consistent going forward?", "Frank Ten Brink", "Well, the 75 to 90 is what we feel is a normal year for recalls, and obviously in the 90 there are some large recalls in the 75 that\u2019s really small. And so within those parameters, the rest is regular mix.", "Scott Levine \u2013 JPMorgan", "Got it. One last one, I believe you have a partnership with a major solid waste provider to provide bundled services to hospitals, I believe. Can you talk about what level of activity you\u2019re seeing there, what expectations you might have? Is it particularly meaningful or any other color would be helpful?", "Richard Kogler", "We have an existing relationship with one of the large companies, Republic. And in the event that a customer wants to have solid waste or recycling services, then we can bring Republic in. We don\u2019t do bundling in the classic sense. Bundling is where you basically go into the lower level of the organization or you\u2019re into purchasing and you\u2019re trying to convince them you can do everything that they need to have done. And it\u2019s really sort of a cost saving play. It isn\u2019t really where we\u2019re at in our program.", "Scott Levine \u2013 JPMorgan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer, your line is now open.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. With regard to the existing consensus for 2011 earnings, you guys came out with a little bit of a lower range. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong. That does not include the pending HWS, and if you could refresh me on what that contribution could be? And then as a follow-up, just your thoughts on the growth rate and the potential for expansion on it next year?", "Frank Ten Brink", "So, the numbers do not include the Health Waste Solution business. It does include the impact of interest. We talked a little bit about that at our last call, and we indicated at that time that it was about $0.05 to $0.06 kind of headwinds with respect to the private placement that now has been funded. ", "And in fact, as to how we use the private placement and not reducing all our term debt, but part of the term debt and part of the revolver to keep the availability for the HWS and other acquisitions, that probably increased the interest costs by another $0.02 to $0.03, potentially, because of how we allocated those repayments. And so, in total, depending on if analysts have included that, that\u2019s about a $0.09 difference from prior times when people maybe looked at it. So I would urge all the analysts to look at their interest expense and to incorporate the proper allocation of that private placement and the costs related to it.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Alright. Thanks on that, Frank. With regard to the RMS, and I guess it\u2019s implied in your guidance what you\u2019re expecting for fourth quarter with regard to this elevated level of recall activity this year. Could you just refresh what is a tail on a typical job there, as far as revenue coming through to you? Is this weeks, months? I know it varies, but if there\u2019s a rule of thumb we could follow?", "Mark Miller", "It\u2019s actually over several quarters. It\u2019s very rare that there\u2019s an activity we do that is contained within a short period. There may be notifications, calls, there may be a follow-up, testing of the market, a shelf sweep testing, there may be follow-up fulfillments, there may be further inquiries by regulatory agencies to the company that wants us to go back and check even further. So it can go on for several quarters, if not more than a year on some of them.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Thanks. And Mark you kind of outlined kind of how the operations flow. Is it similar to think about the revenue the same way?", "", "Mark Miller", "It\u2019s not linear because it\u2019s dependent on the activity and what specifically we\u2019re requested to do. And we had one recently where we went out and went over to 50,000 stores in face-to-face hand sweep visits in a short period of time. So obviously something like that requires a bigger spike of activity, and there may be others where it\u2019s a call center or other backup activities which are more normalized.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Thanks. And just a couple more for me, I believe you said in the prior question, the brunt of the acquisition, annualized acquisition contribution was Japan and Portugal?", "Frank Ten Brink", "Japan and Portugal were the larger ones of the $18 million annualized revenue, yes.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Okay. Thanks. And could you update us on your activities in Brazil?", "Frank Ten Brink", "Brazil is really on track, great team, and we see very good growth potential, both internal as well as through acquisitions.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Rich Skidmore from Goldman Sachs, your line is now open.", "Richard Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Thank you. Good afternoon. Frank, just to be clear on the interest expense you are talking about, you are roughly in the $44 million to $45 million range for 2011?", "Frank Ten Brink", "I think that would be an appropriate number, not way off.", "Richard Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Okay. And then just on the regulated returns number, I think you mentioned it at the very beginning of the call, but I missed it. Can you just restate what that regulated returns number was, or the year-over-year change in the third quarter?", "Frank Ten Brink", "Say that again?", "Richard Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Just the regulated return management business revenue contribution in the quarter or the year-over-year change in that business.", "Frank Ten Brink", "The amount of revenues in the quarter were $31.9 million.", "Richard Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Okay. And then maybe just a step back kind of broader question. As I look at EBITDA margins for Stericycle, it\u2019s been in that 31% over five of the last six quarters, kind of stepped up from 2008 levels in the 28% to 29% range. As you look forward, are you feeling good about that level of EBITDA margin? Are you seeing that there\u2019s opportunities to step that up? And how would you anticipate the acceleration in the margin going forward?", "Frank Ten Brink", "I think there are so many factors that play on that margin. It could be mix, it\u2019s foreign exchange, acquisitions can at times bring that down again. And so one has to watch that a little bit. But I think low 30s is probably with an upside. And I know your question, again, on interest, I think it\u2019s going to be closer to the 40 than your 45.", "", "Richard Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Okay. And then I think in the prior question, the questioner asked about the potential operating metrics of the announced acquisition with Healthcare Waste. I\u2019m not sure if you gave any numbers, but can you provide any operating metrics, either top-line, any numbers that you\u2019ve been able to provide at this point?", "Frank Ten Brink", "Sure. The revenues are in the high 40s. We anticipate that after the close, pretty much similar to MedServe, at the end of that first year, about $0.01 to $0.02 of accretion, and then in the second year, thereafter about $0.04 to $0.05.", "Richard Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "", "And your last question comes from the line of Richard Close from Jefferies & Company, your line is now open.", "Sean Dodge -- Jefferies & Company", "", "Thank you. This is Sean Dodge. Most of what I haven\u2019t answered, the last question I had, though was 6% internal growth rate in the international segment. You know, when you look at the comps you\u2019re lapping from the previous year, it looks like it\u2019s a little bit of a deceleration. And with the rollout of the premium services to the international market in the last 6 to 12 months, I would have expected to see that move in the opposite direction. I was just wondering if you could provide any color as to the reason for the deceleration?", "Mark Miller", "I think part of it is just the \u2013 as we continue to focus mix shift, we\u2019re more focused on the profitability in the small space and adding new services and less focused on the LQ. So sometimes when you do that you may be walking or letting LQ accounts go that don\u2019t make economic sense or don\u2019t meet certain criteria on the space, which may affect those growth rates. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s material to the numbers.", "Sean Dodge \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "Alright. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason Rogers from Great Lakes Review, your line is now open.", "Jason Rogers - Great Lakes Review", "Hi, just a question on HWS, which seems like a good opportunity to expand some of your other services. But from what I looked at or understood of what the company does, they do deal a lot with bundling the services together for the customers. And I just wanted to get your thoughts on how that plays out with the services that you offer.", "Richard Kogler", "Yes. As I said before, I think bundling is an approach that some of the solid waste companies have used or maybe continue to use. That\u2019s not what Health Waste is about; that\u2019s not what we\u2019re about. Their program, which they call resource management is a consultative program that is really a totally transparent process. And it helps healthcare providers improve not only their cost and efficiency management, but also safety, compliance and sustainability. It\u2019s a program that basically has a lot of appeal in the C-suite and the higher levels of these large hospitals and large healthcare providers, and that really is not bundling.", "Jason Rogers - Great Lakes Review", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of David Manthey from Robert W. Baird and Company, your line is now open.", "David Manthey - Robert W. Baird and Company", "", "Thank you. Good afternoon guys. Frank, could you please go over the puts and takes on the gross margin again? I\u2019m having a hard time here understanding if you mean quarter-to-quarter or year-over-year, and how those add up?", "Frank Ten Brink", "Yes. So the one that he asked for was the 30 basis points quarter-to-quarter. So in this case, there was, on a sequential quarter, so the third quarter of \u201810 versus the second quarter of \u201810. And there was a \u2013 if you adjusted that for the restructuring, it came to 30 basis points. And so that\u2019s how I explained the 30 basis points.", "David Manthey - Robert W. Baird and Company", "", "Okay. That makes sense. I think we can back into it based on the information you\u2019ve given us, but can you give us the range and average gross margins for the returns management segment?", "Frank Ten Brink", "Again, we don\u2019t give that detail from that point. We\u2019ve always said that on the base business, it\u2019s not dissimilar from the total. But obviously, if you do very large recalls, those margins are normally lower.", "David Manthey - Robert W. Baird and Company", "", "Can you tell us what percentage of your revenues today are in British pounds and what is in Canadian dollars also?", "Frank Ten Brink", "Again, if you look at the amount of revenue in the quarter for Europe, that\u2019s the segment reporting that we do, it was 49.3 million in the quarter.", "David Manthey - Robert W. Baird and Company", "", "Okay. Alright. And then finally, as it relates to the opportunity here of the resource management, this consulting model, I suppose the plan here is long term not to get ahead of ourselves, but after you get this deal closed, this is the sort of service you roll out to the remainder of your network, I would imagine. And could you \u2013 can you size this opportunity? Do you have any thoughts on how big this is or how quickly you can roll this out?", "Richard Kogler", "No, we really don\u2019t, at this point want to give any color to that. What I can tell you is that this resource management program on top of the menu of service offerings that we currently provide, I think, will be attractive to a number of our customers. I think, as Frank also said, we\u2019re looking at about one-year integration of the whole company. So it\u2019s going to take us a little bit of time, and that\u2019s why I really don\u2019t want to give you too many forward projections here. Give us a little bit of time to kind of put all these pieces together with other pieces.", "David Manthey - Robert W. Baird and Company", "", "Got it. Okay. And then finally, I missed the number of shares you bought in the quarter. And could you tell us also what number of shares you have left authorized under the current authorization?", "", "Frank Ten Brink", "We have about 2.2 million left, 2.3 million. And we bought about 308,000 shares.", "David Manthey - Robert W. Baird and Company", "", "308? Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Miller, I turn the call back over to you.", "Mark Miller", "Well, we thank you all for your time and attention today. Two quick reminders; first of all, it\u2019s Halloween, be safe because you\u2019re driving around and the kids are trick-or-treating. But most importantly, please get out and vote next week if you haven\u2019t already done so. Take care.", "Operator", "", "This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Stericycle First Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Laura Murphy, Vice President of Corporate Finance, you may begin your conference.", "Laura Murphy", "VP, Corporate Finance ", " ", "Welcome to Stericycle's Quarterly Conference Call. Joining me on today's call will be Frank ten Brink, CFO; Rich Kogler, COO; and Mark Miller, Chairman and CEO.", "I will now read the Safe Harbor statement. Statements by Stericycle in this conference call that are not strictly historical are forward looking. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and should be viewed with caution. Factors described in the company's Form 10-K, 10-Qs, as well as its other filings with the SEC could affect the company's actual results and could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from expected results. The company makes no commitment to disclose any revisions to forward-looking statements or any facts, events or circumstances after this date that may bear upon forward-looking statements. I will now turn it over to Frank.", "Frank ten Brink", "The results for the first quarter are as follows: revenues were $398.1 million, up 18.8% from $335.2 million in the first quarter of '10; domestic revenues were $290.6 million; domestic regulated waste and compliance services revenues were $254.8 million; the returns and recall revenues in the quarter were $35.8 million; and international revenues were $107.5 million, including a favorable exchange impact of $2.3 million. ", "The domestic internal growth, excluding returns management, was up approximately 7%, consisting of small quantity, up 8%, and large quantity, up 5%. International internal growth, adjusted for exchange, was up over 8%. Acquisitions less than 12 months old contributed $30.6 million to the growth in the quarter. The gross profit was $182.4 million or 45.8% of revenues, and SG&A expense was $75.3 million or 18.9% of revenues. And net interest expense was $11.2 million. ", "Net income attributable to Stericycle is $55.7 million or $0.64 per share on an as-reported basis and $0.68 adjusted for acquisition expenses and restructuring costs. At the end of the quarter, the revolver borrowings were approximately $97 million and is floating at LIBOR plus 75 basis points. The unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $579 million. ", "Our capital spending was $11.7 million, and the DSO at the end of the quarter was 51 days. Cash provided from operations was $65.6 million for the quarter, and this includes a $17 million decrease in the balance of cash used for recalled product reimbursements. So adjusted for this, the cash provided from operations was $82.6 million. ", "And I will now turn it over to Rich.", "Richard Kogler", "At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 489,000 accounts, of which over 475,500 were small, and the remainder were large. We continue to see strong growth worldwide, driven by new account acquisition and the adoption of our expanding portfolio of service offerings. ", "With our Large Quantity customers, we have multiple service offerings, which add to the value of each account. And today, less than 20% of our LQ customers are using our multiple services, leaving more than 80% of our LQ customer base available for growth. ", "Likewise, with our Small Quantity customers, we offer multiple services that increase the value of an account. And today, approximately 1/3 of our SQ customers utilize our multiple services, which leaves 2/3 of our customer base available for growth. ", "We want to thank each member of our worldwide team, especially our team members in Japan, for their solid performance and continued commitment to our customers and shareholders. I'll turn it over to Mark.", "Mark Miller", "I'd now like to provide our insight and our current outlook for 2011. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements. ", "During the first quarter this year, we completed 9 acquisitions: 3 domestic and 6 international. The incremental revenue impact in the first quarter of 2011 was $1.8 million. On April 18, we announced the completion of HWS acquisition, and the annualized revenues of all of these acquisitions is approximately $57 million. Now keep in mind that our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, acquisition-related expenses and integration expenses. And please note, we have not yet finalized the integration expense estimate for HWS. ", "We believe analysts' EPS estimates will be in the range of $2.79 to $2.82, which we are comfortable with. We believe analysts' revenue estimates will be in the range of $1.61 billion to $1.64 billion, depending on assumptions for growth in foreign exchange. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow between $284 million and $288 million, and as reported free cash flow of $261 million to $265 million. CapEx is anticipated between $45 million and $55 million.  ", "And in closing, we're very excited about the tremendous growth opportunities in 2011 and beyond. We thank you for your time, and we will now go to question-and-answer. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Jonathan Ellis from Bank of America.", "Jonathan Ellis - BofA Merrill Lynch", "First question, I just wanted to ask about, in terms of understanding the impact of fuel this quarter. Are there any other factors? Frank, can you walk us through -- I know you have in the past, sort of the sequential change in gross margins?", "Frank ten Brink", "Yes, so the gross margins in the fourth quarter, we were about 46.37%. We had a bad impact from mix, foreign exchange and acquisitions, which was a negative impact of 35 to 40 basis points. Fuel was about 15 to 20 basis points. And the base business was slightly up to even, getting us to the 45.84%.", "Jonathan Ellis - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And I know in the past, you talked about sequential gross margin growth in the base business on the order I think, 25 to 30 bps per quarter. Anything we should be sensitive to this quarter on sequential margins in the base business?", "Frank ten Brink", "No, I think the outlook for the year is still definitely that, that we see year end over year end, as we set the 40 to 60 basis points. Q1 had a slight impact from weather in the cost side, not as much in the revenue, but in the cost. But I think for the year, we still look for that.", "Jonathan Ellis - BofA Merrill Lynch", "So to be clear, 40 to 60 for the fully -- for the balance of the year or for the full year in total?", "Frank ten Brink", "Yes, what you, however, do have to do is again the impact of acquisitions will have, really could have a dramatic impact that time, so you need to really look at it from the prior quarter. So for example, now the inclusion of HWS will bring gross margins down because that, as a mix impact, will have a negative from the gross margin percent, not on the gross margin dollars. So those things will impact gross margins, and you need to take those into account.", "Jonathan Ellis - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Would you be willing to offer up what you think the estimated drag from acquisitions that have already been completed this year will be for the balance of the year?", "Frank ten Brink", "I think if you look in Q2 and then you can kind of step it up because we don't assume any acquisitions in the guidance, HWS itself could be 50 basis points.", "Jonathan Ellis - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Second, just on HWS. I was doing some just math, and I know your guidance for next year is $0.04 of EPS accretion. If -- trying to then back into what that implies in terms of an EBITDA margin, I'm using your revolver as a source of funding for that acquisition, I get to about 25% EBITDA margin. Assuming $0.04 of EPS accretion, that seems low relative to corporate average EBITDA margins, as well as you think about the synergies that could come from this kind of acquisition.  Can you help us understand the reason why you may not get above corporate average margins postsynergy for that deal?", "Frank ten Brink", "Well again, we're going through ourselves right now in determining the mix between SQ and LQ. And their mix is not as favorable as we have as a corporate average. That's one aspect. I don't know what you or other analysts are obviously are using with respect to the LIBOR rate assumptions and borrowing rates assumptions, so I mean that can make a difference between any of the analysts. And obviously, the integration is going to take about 12 months. It's very similar to the MedServe kind of transaction, so you'll really see it come at the end of declining -- starting month 9, 10, 11. It's when it maybe starts to come a little bit to it, but that's really into next year then.", "Jonathan Ellis - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Just last question, the -- if you could provide the percentage of revenue from energy? And then also help us understand, was there an impact from surcharges on reported growth for SQ and LQ this quarter? And should we expect the contribution in 2Q from surcharges more so than in 1Q?", "Frank ten Brink", "Yes, so the total energy was about 5.7% to revenue for the company wide.", "Mark Miller", "I think, Jonathan, really, we don't find it quite as challenging this  time compared to say, 2008. For one thing, we're stepping up in the range of like 50 basis points quarter-over-quarter. If you remember in 2008, total energy for the company was 7.6% of revenue. So from our standpoint, because we've been able to see some offset from declining energy costs and the fact that we have some efficiencies because obviously 2, 3 years later, the company has that much more route density and other operating efficiencies that are in place, we haven't found fuel to be as big of a challenge. And so we really haven't seen that much need for surcharges. And we'll continue to look at them. We'll continue to monitor the price of oil. But at this point, it hasn't been as big a challenge as it was two years ago.", "Jonathan Ellis - BofA Merrill Lynch", "So to be clear then, in terms of the reported revenue this quarter for SQ and LQ, surcharges were not a material contributor?", "Frank ten Brink", "Correct, they were not a material one.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels from William Blair.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "Mark, could you go back to the acquisitions that you did? It sounds like a very strong international acquisition quarter. Maybe give us a little bit more color on the geographies of those? And then just what the business mix is in the acquisition?", "Frank ten Brink", "Yes, I'll take that one, this is Frank. There were two in the U.K., two in Romania, one in Ireland and one in Chile for a total of 6. All of the transactions that we did were in the Regulated Medical Waste and Compliance Services business.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "And that's both U.S. and abroad?", "Frank ten Brink", "That is correct.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "And then on the guidance, I just want to make sure I understand the EPS guidance. Did you say that does or does not include the integration expenses that you're still kind of working through?", "Frank ten Brink", "It does not include the HWS integration expenses.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "And then on the Rx compliance, I know you guys have been excited about that being a novel growth opportunity. I know the FDA was supposed to have some commentary out about potentially moving that into the universal waste stream. I'm curious if that has slowed down that business at all relative to expectations? Or if the desire to properly dispose of it and state regs have continued to push that forward?", "Mark Miller", "No, I mean we still believe it's an opportunity of $200 million-plus. We're seeing good traction in all the markets that we're operating in. We're seeing interest from IDMs and some of the larger hospital groups. If anything, the awareness is growing.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "And then maybe one more quick one. You mentioned your Japanese operations earlier. I know you ended that towards the end of last year. Was there actually any issues there or any slowdown in that business? Or were they far enough away to kind of continue as normal?", "Mark Miller", "They're located on the north island. And no, there was no damage or impact from that direct area that's been of concern. We did have operational challenges because of rolling blackouts for power and things, but the team did a beautiful job and managed through it. And the customers were not affected.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Scott Levine from JPMorgan.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "With regard to the Returns business, I don't know if you mentioned the guidance for the year there, but at nearly $36 million of revenue, if I have that right, it sounds like you're running ahead. Is there any update to the view there on RMS for the year?", "Frank ten Brink", "Yes, the guidance now is $95 million to $105 million.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And I'm assuming the strength in the quarter largely recall driven?", "Mark Miller", "That is correct.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then when you still thinking about SG&A kind of running in that 18% to 19% band, it looks like it's still there. Any change in view or application of strategic spend to individual products or any color around future expectations?", "Mark Miller", "The trend has improved. We would say the guidance for '11 is going to be in the low 19s. And again, that includes the SG&A, the stock option expensing and the amortization costs.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Following up on last comment on acquisitions. It does look in the last -- the last couple of quarters, obviously, seems very active for acquisitions in general. But particularly international, is it just a function of opportunity, timing of closing? Maybe you can comment on the U.S. markets specifically? I'm guessing it's just the timing issue and you're focused on both markets. And I'm just curious, whether there's any change in the pipeline or multiples paid or any color there?", "Mark Miller", "No, pipeline, even though we did HWS, remains over $100 million. It keeps getting replenished, both on the domestic and international front. It's very active, remains very active, and the multiples are remaining in line with what we've done in the past.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Got it. And then one last one, can you give the leverage calculation at quarter end?", "Frank ten Brink", "It was 1.98. That was the debt-to-EBITDA. That's our covenant calc.", "Scott Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And pro forma for HWS?", "Frank ten Brink", "If you would have included HWS then -- and that's a conservative one that we make the calc, you come to about 2.4 to 2.5.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk from Wedbush Securities.", "Albert Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc.", "Rich, could you comment on what you're seeing in terms of the multiservice approach, both on LQ and SQ? I know there's a lot of headroom and opportunity there. But are you sensing that there's a little bit more of an acceleration on adoption of multiservice? Or given the economic challenges, that people are content at the moment to stay put with the service level?", "Richard Kogler", "No, I mean, we're actually seeing strong adoption. And the reason for that, I think, is that our multiple services, in many cases, relieve headaches and save money for the customers. And in this period of time, when healthcare is looking to try to outsource more things that are nonhealthcare functions, the multiple services play right into that. The other thing that folks are looking at obviously is sustainability initiatives and things like our reusable sharps program play right into that.", "Albert Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc.", "Are there theoretical targets where that makes sense to raise either LQ and SQ to a certain level? Or again, not on a given quarter, but over the next couple of years, how we should think about that?", "Mark Miller", "Well, we give you kind of how much of the customers. In this case, 1/3 that are using multiple services worldwide for SQ and less than 20% for LQ. Since we keep replenishing the customer base through acquisitions and internally, that number may at times, quarter-to-quarter even go down a little bit, so that the opportunity becomes bigger for us. So I think with our keep-replenishing mode, it may go up. But it may also remain fairly flat, and that's a good opportunity for us because it keeps the pipeline open.", "Albert Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc.", "I certainly appreciate that. But I was just trying to drive at maybe some theoretical targets on what's \"in house,\" so to speak, today. On the Rx side, I'll just to follow up on that. What are -- what do you mean when you talk about the awareness is growing? And when do you think this gets a little bit closer to trending towards the multiyear target of $200 million opportunity for you?", "Mark Miller", "No, I think it keeps feeding. So similar -- I want to take you back to the Bio Systems, where it really became a very nice and gradual growth of customers each quarter. This is not going to be dissimilar, could be a little bit accelerated, but I think in total, it's one that's a gradual program. It's being fed by obviously the leads that people have and the sales force that addresses that market, but it's a gradual, continuous growth that comes from that.", "Albert Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc.", "And then finally, just to tighten up on Japan. I know it was asked earlier, but what -- are there greater market opportunities there now as a result of some of this event-driven -- events that have happened over the past couple of months? Could you just talk about maybe what markets internationally you're seeing increased opportunities?", "Mark Miller", "Markets that we see opportunities remain Northern Europe, Central Europe, Spain and then obviously, all of Latin America shows great opportunities still for us. Japan has opportunities. I wouldn't say that it's accelerated or decelerated as a result. It's going to be a slower process, either before or after what happened in Japan. That really is not impacted by it. We keep building relationships with people, which is very important in Japan as well as in other parts of the world. And that's what keeps feeding our current pipeline, which is over $100 million.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson from Morgan Stanley.", "Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley", "Just following up on the last one, given the most recent international acquisitions, could you provide an update in terms of where you are in the broader scheme of things, on the emphasis for expanding into Northern and Central Europe? Is there still a long runway for additional deals there? Or are you getting to the point where your focus might, at some point in the near future, shift to elsewhere in the world for M&A?", "Mark Miller", "No, there's a lot of activity that goes on in both the countries we're in, as well as into the territories that we just mentioned. And there's enough work for us with the team that's doing that right now that will keep us busy.", "Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley", "And on the domestic front, are there any changes that you sense in the regulatory environment for M&A? Some of the other companies we follow are saying they're having more of a difficult time and that the environment has gotten noticeably worse for getting any deals done. Have you sensed any shifts taking place?", "Mark Miller", "No, not at all. And in fact, in our case, I would say that there's been less competition a little bit, not from a point of there's others in the industry, but we had a lot of competition in the old days from financial buyers. And they have had rougher time finding financing. The competition may come from others in the industry. And so that's key, and that will continue. But overall, no, it's very similar.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of David Manthey from Robert W. Baird.", "David Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "I was wondering if you could give us an example of one of your markets where you have very high density. And if you could discuss what kind of market share you think you have there and the kind of growth in EBIT margin you've been experiencing lately?", "Frank ten Brink", "I don't think we provide that kind of color. And traditionally, we haven't. So I think what I was referring to earlier on one of the other questions is, as we continue to do tuck-ins, which densify our routes, our routes become more efficient, which help us kind of weather things like this fuel increase.", "David Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "And then a related question, are you seeing incremental costs of operating your incinerators or autoclaves as well? And are you able to recapture those costs? And then a follow up on to what we just talked about. Are you able to take disproportionate share in a high energy cost environment because your smaller comps, it's a larger percentage of their costs?", "Mark Miller", "I don't think I quite understand the question, I'm sorry.", "David Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Well I'm thinking because of your route density, you're able to better leverage fuel costs and all other energy costs, whereas if your smaller competitors do more windshield time, theoretically that would mean energy's a larger percentage of their cost structure. And if it goes up, they would be less competitive relative to you?", "Mark Miller", "Well we've always been focused on extending margins and driving efficiency in the business. And I'd like to think that we are always trying to be the low-cost provider.", "David Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "And then just the other question. In terms of, are you seeing higher energy costs relative to operating incinerators and autoclaves and are you passing that through?", "Mark Miller", "Actually, we've seen some benefit in the total scheme of energy for what powers our plant, electricity and natural gas. That's been offsetting the increase in diesel.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to the presenters.", "Mark Miller", "Well we thank everybody for their attention to the call today. But before we sign off, it's a very special day. We wanted to thank all of the Stericycle Administrative Professionals, whose hard work and dedication are key to our success. And in particular, we want to recognize Rhonda Toth, for all she contributes to the continued successes of Stericycle. So everybody, have a great day. And again, thank you so much.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the second quarter earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ms. Murphy, you may now begin your conference.", "Laura Murphy", "Welcome to Stericycle's quarterly conference call. Joining me on today's call will be Frank ten Brink, CFO; Rich Kogler, COO; and Mark Miller, Chairman and CEO.", "I will now read the Safe Harbor statement. Statements by Stericycle in this conference call that are not strictly historical are forward looking. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and should be viewed with caution. Factors described in the company's Form 10-K, 10-Qs, as well as its other filings with the SEC, could affect the company's actual results and could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from expected results. The company makes no commitment to disclose any revisions to forward-looking statements or any facts, events or circumstances after this date that may bear upon forward-looking statements. ", "I will now turn it over to Frank.", "Frank ten Brink", "Thanks, Laura. The results for the second quarter are as follows. Revenues were $410.4 million, up 18% from $347.7 million in the Q2 of '10. Domestic revenues were $300.7 million. Domestic regulated waste and compliance services revenue were $273.8 million. Returns and recall revenues were $26.9 million in the quarter. International revenues were $109.7 million, including a favorable exchange impact of $7.4 million.", "Domestic internal growth, excluding returns management, was up 8%, consisting of Small Quantity, up 9%; and Large Quantity customers, up 6%. International internal growth adjusted for exchange was up 4%. Acquisitions less than 12-month old contributed $34.9 million to the growth in the quarter, and gross profit was $186.7 million or 45.5% of revenues. SG&A expense was $78 million or 19% of revenues, and net interest expense was $12.9 million. And just a comment, in May, we repaid the remaining balance of the $76.9 million of our 2009 3-year term loan and accelerated the noncash unamortized term loan fees of $1.2 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle is $55.5 million or $0.63 per share on an as reported basis and $0.69 adjusted for acquisition expenses and the term loan fees. ", "Now the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, the revolver borrowings were approximately $387 million, and the unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $297 million. We purchased 50,675 shares of common stock in the open market in an amount of $4.3 million in the quarter. Cumulatively, we've purchased approximately 14.7 million shares and still have authorization to purchase an additional 5.8 million shares. The CapEx in the quarter was $12 million, and our DSO was 53 days. The cash provided from operations year-to-date was $119.7 million. ", "And I will now turn it over to Rich.", "Richard Kogler", "Thanks, Frank. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 508,000 accounts of which over 493,600 were Small and the remainder were Large. We continue to see strong worldwide growth driven by new account acquisition, the adoption of our expanding portfolio of service offerings. Today, only 20% of our LQ and 30% of our SQ customers are using more than one of our multiple services. And the remaining pool of customers provides a long runway for future growth. We remain very excited about this opportunity because adoption of multiple services has the potential to more than double or triple the revenues per customer.", "We want to thank each number of our worldwide team for their solid performance and their continued commitment to our customers and shareholders. I'll turn it over to Mark.", "Mark Miller", "Thanks, Rich. I'd now like to provide insight in our current outlook for 2011, and please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements. During the second quarter, we completed 11 acquisitions; 7 domestic and 4 international, and this includes the Healthcare Waste Solutions or HWS acquisition, which we discussed in our last call. Revenues from acquisitions not previously announced were $1.2 million in the quarter and annualized were approximately $9.8 million. Now keep in mind that our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures and acquisition-related expenses. ", "We believe analyst EPS estimates after adjusting for the Healthcare Waste Solutions integration expenses will be in the range of $2.78 per share to $2.80 per share, which we are comfortable with. We believe analyst revenue estimates will be in the range of $1.62 billion to $1.65 billion depending on assumptions for growth in foreign exchange. Believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow between $284 million and $288 million and an as reported free cash flow of $261 million to $265 million. CapEx is anticipated between $45 million and $55 million.", "In closing, very excited about the tremendous growth opportunities in 2011 and beyond. We thank you for your time. And operator, we'll now go to the Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of a participant who did not leave their information. Please state your first and last name.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "It's Ryan Daniels from William Blair. Let me ask quickly on the guidance. I know you were previously at $2.79 to $2.82, but we're pretty clear that that did not include the HWS integration expenses. Can you give us a feel for what that impact is so we can kind of make an apples-to-apples comparison to guidance?", "Frank ten Brink", "Yes. The acquisitions that we did and the integration expenses were roughly about $0.02. And so on the bottom end, it's only came down $0.01, $2.79 to $2.78, and on the top end, $2.82 to $2.80.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "Okay. So effectively the same or a little higher on the bottom line. That's helpful. And then, Frank, can you give us a little more color on the gross margins? I know we anticipated they were going to be down given the Healthcare Waste Solutions coming into the revenue stream. But I think in the past, you've helped us as with our models, talking about the fuel, the FX, the mix shift and acquisitions in the multicore business was.", "Frank ten Brink", "Yes. So in the quarter Q1, we ended at 45.8%. As we discussed in the first quarter at our conference call, the Healthcare Waste Solutions impacted us by 50 basis points down. The foreign exchange and kind of the higher, slightly higher, revenues and RMS kind of mix was about 9 to 10 basis points. And then the remainder of the business did about 29 to 30 bps up on the business. And so if you now look forward, we anticipate that there's not a lot of impact in Q3 versus Q2 from acquisitions. So we anticipate kind of a 20, 30 basis points improvement, kind of excluding new acquisitions and foreign exchange in the quarters to come.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "Okay, great. And then last question, I'll hop off. Just in regards to international, I know it was a bit weaker than the run rate coming in at 4%. Part of that's probably a really tough comp. I think you're at 9.4% in the year ago period. Is there anything else there beside the tough comp to seeing any weakness over in Europe or maybe in Japan post the disaster there?", "Richard Kogler", "Yes, Ryan, this is Rich. I'll address that. Actually, it's really the impact just comes in the U.K. from 2 areas. One is, we lost a regional LQG contract that was primarily an incineration contract. When it came up for bid, we bidded to improve the margins and we were not able to keep it. So you'll see some effect from that in the next couple of quarters. And then the other thing about the U.K. is, we lost effectively 2 collection days because of the additional holidays they had recently. Otherwise, the remainder of the business is doing very well. No problems in any other areas. And our guidance for the year will stay at a 5% to 7% growth.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "Okay. Do you know the impact of that 2 collection day loss, the kind of anomaly there?", "Frank ten Brink", "It's probably about somewhere around $1 million.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "Okay, perfect. And was the big LQ contract even profitable for you, guys?", "Richard Kogler", "Well, it was incinerate only in the net market. Incineration capacity is very tight. We're obviously looking at our SQG business expanding. We're looking at other more profitable contracts. So for us it was a decision about either getting the right margin or moving away from it. Like the U.S., you'll see that we'll have a disciplined approach in the U.K. and other international markets through LQG. We need to get to the right margin level or we need to move on.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Richard Close from Avalon.", "Richard Close - Jefferies & Company", "Yes, it's Richard Close, Avondale Partners here. Just curious if you could talk a little bit about your acquisition pipelines. I guess you made an acquisition with a natural base company here and NotifyMD back in the spring. And can you talk about any other service areas that might make sense for you, guys, to expand into?", "Frank ten Brink", "Yes, the acquisition pool, even though we did obviously the HWS transaction in the quarter, which was about $45 million in revenues is still over $100 million worldwide. And these are companies that we actively talk to. It's not a wish list. Your other part on the patient communication Notify, it was a platform acquisition for us. It's kind of a new area for existing customers. It is a service that services both our Small and Large customers. And again, what we like in that business, the relationship is very long term and contractual, so very similar to what we have elsewhere. And so it's kind of a start for us to add additional services with our customers.", "Richard Close - Jefferies & Company", "Okay, and then when we think about the international opportunity, I believe you talked a little bit about expanding into other countries. For some reason, I want to say Brazil was near the top of your list. If you could talk a little bit about other geographic areas that could prove fruitful for you, guys, in the short term.", "Frank ten Brink", "Yes. The countries and the areas that we're excited about obviously are, first of all, all the countries we're in. We did an acquisition this quarter in Romania, one in Canada, one in Argentina and one in Brazil. So nicely spread, and that continues to build density in those geographies and in those areas. If you look at new geographies, Brazil, we did enter last year, but newer ones could be Northern Europe, could be southern Europe, Spain, for instance, are areas. And then if you skip over to the South America, I mean, obviously, we're in all the major countries. We'll continue to look in Japan where we just have entered to continue to look for acquisitions. Those are kind of our main focus geographies.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Akil Marsh from Atlantic Equities.", "Akil Marsh - Atlantic Equities LLP", "Could you touch on how you're seeing the uptick rates on some of your premium offerings, in particular pharma waste?", "Richard Kogler", "Sure. I'll be glad to kind of speak to it. I mean, as you know, we don't give specific detail about quantities, but I can tell you that the program continues to have wide acceptance with our Large customers. The acceptance that we're kind of seeing right now is similar to what we saw with Bio Systems, which is once we get into all the markets, then our sales people become more adept at the sale. The customers become more aware of it from referrals. And I can say that we've had a couple of our strongest months here recently. We still believe that it's about a $200 million opportunity for us, and we have obviously a healthy pipeline of orders right now.", "Akil Marsh - Atlantic Equities LLP", "And just one follow-up. On the communication/NotifyMD platform, I realized it's early days, but could you give us a sense of how large of an opportunity that could potentially be?", "Frank ten Brink", "I think if you look for our existing customer base, if they would add all the services, we can grow the relationship almost two-fold. So 100% improved in revenues with that relationship.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Al Kaschalk from Wedbush.", "Albert Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc.", "On the waste, the pharma waste side, $200 million, under 10% penetrated on that, or what's the -- can you square up a little bit on your progress?", "Frank ten Brink", "That's not a bad assumption.", "Albert Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc.", "Okay. Second, fuel cost in the quarter. And what type of headwinds are you looking at or not looking at?", "Frank ten Brink", "I think the total energy for the quarter was 5.7% of revenues. So very -- the same as prior quarter. It was 5.7% the prior quarter. There's no specific headwinds that we see. I mean, it keeps going up and down a little bit, but it's been fairly stable.", "Albert Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc.", "And is there -- I obviously cannot recall, but is there a hedging program there? Or how do you view that, Frank, going forward?", "Frank ten Brink", "We do not hedge, and what we do obviously is, if we see these increases, we do have the ability to pass to our customers.", "Albert Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc.", "Okay. If I take a look at the FX and the returns business considered, and I looked at the growth rate, it looks sub 6% in my math, what seems a little bit lower than you have done historically. And so that's, I guess, a question at when you look at pricing for your customer base, have you seen some recent push back? Or are you experiencing any type of headwind on being able to get price given the economy, just given the market, et cetera?", "Frank ten Brink", "Yes, I think it gets -- starting to get impacted with the returns management, obviously the growth rate. But we're right in line with our guidance that we set for Small Quantities, 8% to 10%, Large. And I think what you do see this quarter, as we've said, we're a little bit lower than the guidance we gave for international, which probably broader and then you have, a very small growth rate because we did $25.4 million second quarter of last year on the returns management; this year, $26.9 million, which again gets very impacted by other large recalls in it or not. We obviously have 2 very strong quarters in Q4 and Q1.", "Albert Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc.", "And just a nice segue, in terms of the guidance, what have you -- are you adjusting anything on the returns business given the $26.7 million you did in the quarter?", "Frank ten Brink", "Yes, the guidance for the year is $100 million to $110 million for the returns and recall business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Just following up on that last one. I'm showing in my model guidance for RMS as of last quarter's call was 95 to 105. Is that correct? So we're going up $5 million on the low and the high end on RMS?", "Frank ten Brink", "That is correct.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Just if we go a little bit more detailed on acquisitions, the 4 international, I caught each country, but is that all core and med waste? Anything unique in those?", "Frank ten Brink", "The international, yes, it's all med waste. On the 6 transactions domestically, we had 5 in the regulated waste and one in the patient communication.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "And then with regard to NotifyMD, you cited the size of the opportunity on a prior question. How quickly do you think that, that can be expanded? When should we start to see impact from that initiative?", "Frank ten Brink", "Again, we're getting to know the marketplace. We're still testing things out, as you know. Stericycle is a marathon, but it's one that we try to learn what the business is about. I think that's going well. It helps the customers with inbound and outbound communication between a healthcare provider and their patients. And it's too early, but we'll give more guidance in '12 and beyond.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Manthey from Baird.", "David Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "First question, on the 2 fewer days in the -- you mentioned in the U.K., is that year-over-year there's 2 fewer days?", "Frank ten Brink", "It's really because of the wedding activities in the U.K. that the country shutdown and Easter, and all those combined Easter was obviously fell slightly different, but it's -- in total, it was about 2 days year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter.", "David Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Got it, okay. And then second question, would you go on to talk about the relative profitability or, say, more specifically, the quantitative profitability of a one-service customer versus a customer that uses 2 or 3 of your services?", "Frank ten Brink", "It depends a little bit what we're adding. So I think we've historically talked with everyone that if we add Steri-Safe, that can improve profitability with the customer. If we would add the Sharps Management, that's at a level similar to what the average is. The pharmaceutical waste is a slightly better margin and obviously improves because we also utilize services. Patient communication is promising and looks good. And then overall internationally, where we have the clinical services, which is kind of a similar package than our Steri-Safe, domestically, that one has better margins than the average for that sector.", "David Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Okay. And you're speaking specifically about gross margin?", "Frank ten Brink", "That is correct.", "David Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Okay. So I would imagine just having a customer relationship, the contribution to EBIT or EBITDA would be even higher, right?", "Frank ten Brink", "Yes. I mean, there's obviously investing that we do to stimulate these programs. Or earlier on, there's a little higher SG&A upfront for things like clinical services or like the development of the pharmaceutical waste program. But yes, we feel that that gets recouped fairly fast.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time.", "Frank ten Brink", "Thanks, everyone, and we're looking forward to the next quarter.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

My name is Jessica, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd to welcome everyone to the fourth quarter 2011 earnings release conference call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Laura Murphy, Vice President, Corporate Finance, you may begin your conference.", "Laura A. Murphy", "Welcome to Stericycle's Quarterly Conference Call. Joining me on today's call will be Frank ten Brink, CFO; Rich Kogler, COO; and Mark Miller, Chairman and CEO.  ", "I will now read the Safe Harbor statement. Statements by Stericycle in this conference call that are not strictly historical are forward looking. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and should be viewed with caution. Factors described in the company's Form 10-K, 10-Qs, as well as its other filings with the SEC, could affect the company's actual results and could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from expected results.

", "I will now turn it over to Frank.", "Frank J. M. ten Brink", "Thanks, Laura. The results for the fourth quarter are as follows. Revenues were $446.6 million, up 13.5% from $393.5 million in Q4 of '10, and internal growth excluding returns and recall revenues was up 7%. Domestic revenues were $316.9 million, of which $287.5 million was domestic-regulated waste and compliance services revenue, and $29.4 million was returns and recalls. Domestic internal growth, excluding returns recalls revenue, was up 8%, consisting of Small Quantity up 9% and Large Quantity up 6%. International revenues were $129.6 million, and internal growth adjusted for unfavorable exchange impact of $2.5 million was up 5%. ", "Acquisitions less than 12 months old contributed $48.9 million to the growth in the quarter. Gross profit was $201.5 million or 45.1% of revenues. SG&A expense was $84.3 million or 18.9% of revenues. Net interest expense was $12.7 million. We have the full quarter impact of the renewal of the senior revolver facility for $1 billion at a spread of 137.5 basis points over LIBOR versus 75 basis points over LIBOR on our prior facility. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $64.3 million or $0.74 per share on an as-reported basis, and $0.76 adjusted for acquisition expenses and other non-recurring expenses. ", "Now the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, the revolver borrowings were approximately $528 million. The unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $313 million. In the quarter, we repurchased over 549,000 shares of common stock on the open market in an amount of $42.9 million. And we have authorization to purchase an additional 4.3 million shares. Capital spending was $16.3 million in the quarter. Our DSO was 59 days. Excluding the third quarter acquisitions, the DSO was 53 days. Q4 year-to-date, the cash provided from operations was $306.1 million.  ", "I will now turn it over to Rich.", "Richard Kogler", "Thanks, Frank. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 522,000 accounts, of which over 506,000 were Small and the remainder were Large. We continued to see strong worldwide growth driven by the expanding portfolio services that complement our core regulated waste service. For our SQ customers, the growth drivers remain Steri-Safe and Clinical Service compliance programs. And for our LQ customers the growth drivers are Sharps Management and Pharma Waste services. ", "Worldwide, we continue to use our strong free cash flow to fuel growth through acquisitions. In the quarter, we closed 8 transactions, 5 of which were domestic and 3 international. For 2012, we anticipate internal growth rates for SQ to be at -- in the range of 8% to 10%; LQ, 5% to 8%; international, 5% to 8%; and recall and returns revenues between $95 million and $115 million. We remain very excited about our future growth opportunity because 80% of our LQ and 70% of our SQ customers only use one of our current service offerings. As customers adopt our multiple services, this can more than double or triple their revenues. ", "I want to close by thanking each member of our worldwide team for their strong performance and continued commitment to our customers and shareholders. And now I'll turn it over to Mark.", "Mark C. Miller", "Thanks, Rich. I'd now like to provide insight on our current outlook for 2012. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements. Revenues from acquisitions completed in the quarter were approximately $2.2 million, and annualized are approximately $10 million. Keep in mind, our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures and acquisition expenses. ", "For 2012, we believe analysts' EPS estimates will be in the range of $3.21 to $3.26, which we are comfortable with. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2012 will be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion, depending on their assumptions for growth and foreign exchange rates. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow between $320 million and $325 million with CapEx anticipated between $60 million and $65 million. ", "In closing, we're very excited about the tremendous growth opportunities in 2012 and beyond. We thank you for your time. And operator, we'll now switch over to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]  Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair & Company.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Let me start with a question on the gross margin. I think, Frank, you had mentioned last quarter that those could be down 50 basis points from M&A, offset by maybe 10, 20 basis points of organic leverage. But it came in much better. It was almost flat sequentially. Any color there and what allowed that to outperform your expectations a few months ago?", "Frank J. M. ten Brink", "Yes. So we ended last quarter with 45.15% in gross margin. The acquisitions in the third quarter did negatively impact it by 46 basis points. Foreign exchange, which in the quarter was kind of a negative to our guidance from a revenue point of view, In fact there was $5.9 million negative impact. That's had about a 20 bps positive impact. And the business itself, it's better by 24 basis points. So that gets to your 45.13%.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. Perfect. helpful color. And then given all the bevy of M&A activity, especially in the third quarter, can you just provide an update on how the integration activities are going and maybe especially in some of the novel markets over in Europe, how that business has been relative to your expectation?", "Richard Kogler", "This is Rich. The most recent new platform is Spain which we talked about last call is on track. There's lot of integration there, but we are pleased to announce that we completed our first follow-on acquisition of an SQG.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. Great. And then Frank, just on the financial, it looked like when you've got your adjusted EPS, you actually hit the GAAP EPS by $0.01 for acquisition expenses. Is that just a change in fair value consideration, contingent payments that's in there, netted against some transaction cost for FAS 141?", "Frank J. M. ten Brink", "Yes, that's exactly what it is. It was contingent that in this case, someone did not make their specific markers.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. Great. Last question I'll ask, and I'll jump back up. I'm just curious if the leap year will have any negative impact on you. Just having an extra day of operation, that seems that doesn't really impact revenue positively. But will that pressure margins at all in the first quarter? Anything to think about gross margin front as we head into Q1 of '12?", "Frank J. M. ten Brink", "No. Historically, it has not happened. We've been all here more than 15 years. I've seen a couple of those, and it has not.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bob (sec) [Scott] Levine with JPMorgan.", "Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Scott Levine. With regard to the acquisition pipeline, it sounds like a slight tilt towards the U.S. with relatively small annualized revenue number. Any noteworthy changes in terms of the mix of the acquisitions? And how much of the U.S. deals were tuck-ins maybe versus other types?", "Frank J. M. ten Brink", "So in Q4 of those that we did, we did 8 in total, 5 domestic, 3 international. The 3 international, one was in Romania, one was in Spain and one in Japan. In total, the pipeline that we still have is over $100 million worldwide, and so there's no dramatic changes there.", "Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And the leverage calculation debt to EBITDA?", "Frank J. M. ten Brink", "Debt to EBITDA was 2.52 at the end of the fourth quarter.", "Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Got it. And then maybe a little bit of color on the add-in services. I was wondering if you could provide an update and just even qualitatively if you don't want to give numbers in terms of the uptake of the advanced service offerings within the SQ base. Will those continue at the same pace, accelerating, decelerating? Maybe a little bit of subjective color there.", "Mark C. Miller", "As we said before, I think the main drivers in SQ remains Steri-Safe and clinical services, and we're seeing good uptake on that. And it's reflected on the growth numbers. On the LQ side, the Sharps Management Service and the Pharma Waste have been particularly pleasing. We had one of our strongest quarters in Q4 for both those services. So I think the growth drivers were all hitting on all 8 cylinders.", "Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Got it. And the premium services within Steri-Safe, that's still continuing the pace, I suppose?", "Mark C. Miller", "Absolutely. On track.", "Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then one last one. Any update with regards to patient notification, that program and your plans there. Or any qualitative color will be helpful.", "Richard Kogler", "Yes. I think as we've talked about, we're still in the trial stage. But we're obviously very excited about it because it's a very large market. And there's been some pieces written on the business, which I think show you that it has good synergy with what we do and leverages off of our current talents within the organization. We're going to build the platform this year. I think it'll have some impact in 2013, and we'll discuss that with next year's guidance.", "Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I see. When do you think the trial phase ends?", "Richard Kogler", "Well, I think the trial phase is not something that is like a 60- or a 90-day thing. You've seen us be fairly discriminatory when we moved into new areas, but I think what we're really saying here is that it won't have a meaningful impact on revenues this year. 2013 and beyond is something different.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.", "Jonathan Demchick - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "This is Jon Demchick in for David. On acquisition competition, can you give us any color on what you're seeing on the deal landscape these days in terms of competition and valuation? And is there any indication that your solid waste competitors have been more active in trying to branch out into medical waste? In general, how has deal competition impacted valuation over the past several quarters?", "Frank J. M. ten Brink", "It really varies from country to country. There's obviously always financial buyers looking at transactions in our space. And depending on country, you could obviously have, and many times have, other companies. I wouldn't say that there's a dramatic change from the past. They've been there, and they continue to be there as competitors for transactions.", "Jonathan Demchick - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. Very helpful. And also one on hospital and physician consolidation. Healthcare providers remain very fragmented, believed in seeing an acceleration in consolidation of healthcare practices, just on the extent among hospitals, but more importantly, among physician offices or if there's just that switch from independent practice to hospital employment. Given the higher margins that you have in smaller customers, is this something that we should be thinking about as potential price or margin pressure going forward?", "Richard Kogler", "Yes. I don't think so because, first off, consolidation is not a new trend. I mean, there's -- people are talking about it right now. The fact is-- there's always been consolidation in healthcare. When hospitals get involved, for example, in small practices, it actually benefits us because there is more focus on compliance. And as everybody knows, our higher-level services focus on compliance. We also have an opportunity to sell more of our services, so at this point, we haven't seen any negative impact.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Harold Kaschalk (sic) [Albert Kaschalk] with Wedbush Securities.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "I don't know if my mother ever called me Harold, but it's Al. Just a follow-up on prior question. Does the team prefer consolidation in the end market customer base? Or is that a non-event? I mean, everyone seems to be concerned about what's happening in terms of increased service opportunities or visits to practitioner's offices versus the number of visits out there. But perhaps it's an opportunity just to clear off for everybody what you guys feel is a preference in terms of your own market.", "Mark C. Miller", "I think our service offering is such that we can benefit whether the market stays in its current state or whether there's an evolution of more patient access or whether there's consolidation. I think it was part of our idea as we started building out the breadth of services. As you consolidate small practices or as they combine, often there's an office manager or someone put in charge that gives us a new contact point who focuses on compliance in the office, allows us to upsell and upgrade. And the other pressure we're seeing is that as hospitals struggle to continue to be productive, our ability to have people inside their institution in-servicing them and helping them reduce their labor component in nursing and staffing is very important. And it's also on the patient communications. I think we'll see opportunities for us to make our customers more productive in their practice and be able to increase their volume and throughput.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "On the guidance, at least a couple of things that stood out. First on CapEx, that looks like it was increased. And if I carry forward a prior commentary at the end of Q3, I think you extended the upper end of your returns business to about 115 from 105. So any incremental color there on what you're -- particularly the CapEx which I think was extended about $10 million", "Frank J. M. ten Brink", "NO. I think the CapEx was 60 to 65. It was -- in the guidance for '11, it was 50 to 55. So maybe that was misinterpreted. There were 2 numbers given last call, one for '11, and one for '12. But the number for '12 did not change. And I think for the RMS, it's really on the up ends. We continue to see good opportunities. The quantity of recalls is increasing. So again, we feel on the upper ends to bring it up 5.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Would you be willing to share, and I guess yes as a way of saying you would share, but are there things outside of healthcare market directly that you've had the benefit of the RMS business?", "Richard Kogler", "I think the RMS business for us, when we started, it was one where we wanted to kind of understand customer needs and build awareness and expand our services. And over the past 3 years, we've expanded services, better understood our customer, gotten the awareness. And we have moved into the consumer space. So I think what you've seen us do in RMS is sort of in some way is outside of the healthcare space. But even so, I mean, with that particular growth engine we still are accessing less than 10% of the domestic opportunity for recalls and for these other services.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "And finally, a couple of those, unique or interesting services, it seem to be appearing upon your website which are short of nontraditional on the industrial side but tied, I guess, towards a little more towards the chemical component. Are you willing to talk a little bit about some of these additional opportunities you're developing?", "Richard Kogler", "Yes, I can describe one, which is an offer -- or a service recall StrongPak. And it's a service offering for retail waste at the small commercial level. Sometimes, this is prescription waste, Rx waste. Sometimes it's haz waste. But it's StrongPak is a unique service offering that helps the retail side dispose of Rx and haz waste. And these are typically sort of like SQG customers. So that's one, for example, that we're in. And we do have haz waste capability because it supports our Pharma Waste program.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "I'll start with a follow-up on RMS. You mentioned that enough confidence to increase the guidance on healthy volumes. Can you just talk a little bit to the environment, the regulatory environment, what may be driving, where you're seeing that? And just a little more help with the enhanced comments.", "Richard Kogler", "Yes. I mean, the regulatory environment has been getting stiffer and stiffer over the last couple of years, which is helping us. And as customers react to that, they're turning to us, I think, more and more for all the menu of services that we have.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "And is the way you provide the guidance, is it -- is there a base level you're certain of? And then maybe if you were to come through it, what -- this incremental move, was it just the environment and said, \"Hey, we felt going into the year\"? Or are there things that you can see and feel and touch right now that allow that to happen?", "Frank J. M. ten Brink", "As we said in the past, the low end of it is what we feel is a base, and the top end will depend on larger recalls.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "With regard to the acquisitions starting domestically, generally what was the mix of Small versus Large for those 5?", "Frank J. M. ten Brink", "It was about 1/3 Small and those that we did, and it's not just domestic, that's for the total of the RMW that we did.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "U.S. and internationally?", "Frank J. M. ten Brink", "Yes.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just curious about Spain. Could you tell us where you stand there? Was that a Large or Small acquisition? I think historically, you've been involved in JVs. So what's going on with your business in that country?", "Frank J. M. ten Brink", "Well, as Rick said, it's obviously on track. We closed it last quarter. The team is doing very well. We completed one follow-on acquisition in the country. The company we bought was predominantly almost north of 95% Large Quantity Generator revenue. It's a mix of public and private in that marketplace. And we think that market, as a whole, has several $100 million opportunity for us.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "And then just one more for me. The -- anything -- I think historically, you said even though it's modeled by acquisition, first quarter is typically a seasonally soft quarter. A, could you just address that? And B, any onetime items we should be thinking about in the first quarter or in 2012 across any of your outlook?", "Mark C. Miller", "Yes. And we gave guidance for the total. What we indicated last quarter may be an update. Gross margin maybe starts in the high 44s, 45, SG&A for next year in the mid-18s are kind of broad guidelines.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Manthey of Robert W. Baird.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "First off, given the 5% to 8% organic growth target for international markets being equivalent to the Large Quantity growth in the U.S., does that say anything about the uptick of ancillary services in international markets? And if not, should that number accelerate as we move forward and the shift goes from Large Quantity to Small Quantity internationally?", "Frank J. M. ten Brink", "Yes. There's a lot of factors that go in. And obviously, adding Spain into that mix, and Spain being 95% Large, so you get a lot of mix factors in this growth. So that Spain should impact and pull that number maybe down a little bit. But the continued to focus on SQ internationally is not stopping and is on track. So I think in each  individual country, they're growing to Small faster than the Large, and that's also a market dynamic. The growth market is growing faster and has always continued to do that.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And approximately what is the mix today internationally of Large Quantity to Small?", "Frank J. M. ten Brink", "I think we've given this for the U.K. where they're north of 30%. We have not given detail past that point.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "North of 30% Small Quantity?", "Frank J. M. ten Brink", "In the U.K., yes.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. All right. And then last quarter, I believe you gave us SG&A x acquisitions, sort of a core SG&A number. Can you give us that number again this quarter?", "Frank J. M. ten Brink", "SG&A excluding the acquisitions, well, I can maybe give it to you. SG&A, the raw numbers if you look at that, it was about 16.88%. And then you have to add to that the stock options and the amortization, and it gets you to about 18.99% or 19% to revenue in the quarter. What really increased in the quarter as a percent is the amortization as, obviously, doing a lot of deals adds to the amortization line, and that's why that has jumped a little bit up.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then finally, on the Patient Notification. Is that a service? Or is it a system, meaning, is it something that you do for your customers? Or is it something you install at their site and they do for themselves? The reason I ask, I'm wondering about the decision maker on -- something like that. Is it -- does it become a telecom or IT decision as opposed to a business manager, office manager-type person?", "Richard Kogler", "It's purely a service. We have all of the IT. And basically, the decision maker is somebody who says that I'm either the office manager or the doctor and I need to have this service. But we maintain all of the infrastructure ourselves.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Richard Close with Avondale Partners.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "A question. I saw an article recently about -- and I believe you guys are doing some hiring 100 full-time jobs -- 100 part-time jobs in Pennsylvania. Can you talk a little bit about that, what exactly that is for, any particular service?", "Frank J. M. ten Brink", "That really is for the patient communication side, and that is because we may remove centers, integrate centers. So you obviously maybe see hiring. You don't necessarily maybe see the other side of it.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So did the patient communication already have a presence in that area? Or are you moving from...", "Frank J. M. ten Brink", "No. We have a presence in that area already.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And overall in the domestic market, can you talk a little bit about the pricing environment? We saw one article where one of the counties mentioned getting a reduction in pricing, and I just was curious whether that was something widespread or just specific to that particular client.", "Richard Kogler", "We haven't seen any changes, and we're not aware of the details about those particular county you're talking about. But obviously, you win a few and you lose some occasionally, but we haven't seen any change or any trend in either direction. It's been pretty steady.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then I guess my final question here would be along the lines of the organic growth numbers. Is there any -- and for the various buckets, SQ, LQ and international, is there anything specific that you can point to that maybe takes you from the bottom end of each of the ranges to the top end of the ranges, just anything that you can point to with respect to that?", "Frank J. M. ten Brink", "Well, as we said many times, Stericycle is a marathon. It's not a sprint. So you're not going to see dramatic changes. And in effect, if you really do the numbers, the 1% change isn't that big a number. So I think -- in a quarter maybe have a slight influx of something more, as you maybe know or not, but we, at times, do some cruise ship work or things that can maybe move it around a little bit. But overall, it's very stable. And I would not read overall a lot into it, if it switches by 1%.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then internationally, anything going on with the financial situations over there that is negatively impacting you guys at all or anything you can point to?", "Frank J. M. ten Brink", "No. In fact, I think it could be an opportunity for us as I think in Spain, it was an opportunity for us. This was a business that was sold by an entity that really needed the cash. And maybe 4, 5 years ago, that would not have been the case. So I think it may create opportunities.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I just want to have just a few kind of small things here and there. I want to know how much you've added on in terms of acquisitions, to the original Notify acquisition, how many acquisitions have you done subsequent to that to kind of walk up in that space?", "Frank J. M. ten Brink", "We haven't totally broken it, but it's somewhere in the 4 to 5.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And are those -- what you're doing now, is that kind of rationalizing call centers and stuff like that? Or you're still kind of figuring that out?", "Frank J. M. ten Brink", "That's, in fact, what Rich was saying. We're building both the platform, as well as the capabilities. And so '12 will be a year where we'll building a platform that will continue to do more acquisitions. But I think overall, it's building the platform and getting to know issues like integration and what it takes to do that.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And so what I'm seeing like a closure of a facility, is that kind of -- is that something that popped up because of the Notify acquisition in the quarter.", "Frank J. M. ten Brink", "That could happen, yes.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Then a couple of other just housekeeping things. How should we expect the AR DSO to decline as you move past the acquisitions that kind of bumped it up in the third quarter?", "Frank J. M. ten Brink", "Well, the third quarter was impacted by the acquisitions we did, and Spain had an impact on that. As we said from a guidance point of view, we anticipate to be between 58 and 61. Certain countries are definitely higher. Spain is one of those internationally. So when you acquire a business, and that your overall DSO will go up. So I think acquisitions may impact that in the future. But the business, as a whole, our guidance for this coming year is 58 to 61, kind of, as a range.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "To what -- is there something that took you by surprise? It seems like the free cash flow was lighter than what the annual guidance was calling for.", "Frank J. M. ten Brink", "No. It was a little bit of timing. As you know, we do have some businesses like the RMS business, which can have an influx in revenue in the last month, which was the case. And so timing was a big impact there, and that can make your receivables go up in that specific timeframe.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "So it really was a timing thing? Because it seems like vis-a-vis the annual there is maybe a $30 million difference versus expectations. And you're saying it's all in RMS?", "Frank J. M. ten Brink", "No. So if you compare -- you need to look at the guidance where we do have the adjust of the $23 million. So quickly for those that have not been on calls before, at the end of '10, we had a $23 million cash inbound, and this was for a recall reimbursement to their respective customers. It showed up as a cash from ops from us, and that cash moved out in the first half of '11. So if you really adjust for that and if you look on an as-reported basis, we really almost -- about $10 million that we were off compared to the guidance. And a lot of that was the timing, and the AR was specifically RMS driving some of that.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. That's very helpful. And then lastly, how should we think of the tax rate going forward?", "Frank J. M. ten Brink", "I think, overall, the tax rate, if you take the adjustment of the 141 out of there and the like, for next year, we would say it's probably about 37% for '12.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brent (sic) [Greg] Halter with Great Lake Review.", "Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review", "I don't want to harp on the receivables, and I won't, so I'll look at the reserve, which was up to, I think, 6.1% of gross receivables versus 4.8% last year. Just wondered if you had any comment on that change.", "Frank J. M. ten Brink", "Yes. You'll see that, that increase already occurred in the third quarter, which was primarily the result of the larger acquisitions we did in that quarter. So the acquisitions there did make that number jump up.", "Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review", "Okay. And what was your fuel expense to revenues in the quarter?", "Frank J. M. ten Brink", "5.6%.", "Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review", "And any expectations on what that might be for 2012? Obviously, you're no experts in the oil markets, but...", "Richard Kogler", "I don't know anybody who can foreshadow that [indiscernible]. I study a whole lot of pundits and still we get surprised. But fortunately, our contracts and our operating methodology allow us to buffer it.", "Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review", "Okay. And with the acquisition of Healthway Solutions coming up on 9 months to almost a year now, just wondered if we could get your thoughts on how that has gone versus your initial expectations.", "Richard Kogler", "It integrated on schedule. The management team has stayed with us, and the employees have been very helpful. They had certain processes that have helped our LQG space. All in all it's performing as we thought, and we're very satisfied.", "Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review", "Okay. And I don't believe I heard the acquisitions, the 8 that were done in the quarter, what type those were, if they were traditional or other areas.", "Frank J. M. ten Brink", "Six were in the regulated waste, and 2 were in patient communication.", "Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review", "All right. And one last one, the returns business total for 2011 amounted to how much?", "Frank J. M. ten Brink", "It was 117.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters.", "Richard Kogler", "Well, I appreciate everybody taking time. And a non-Stericycle but related comment, for those of you who have not seen the Hallmark Hall of Fame movie called A Smile as Big as the Moon, it's going to be repeated on the Hallmark Channel on Saturday at 7:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. Central Time. And the reason it's of interest is Frank ten Brink's son Peter plays the role of Ben Schmidt, a child with Down syndrome. And Peter just does a great job in this very touching movie, and hope you get a chance to watch it. Thank you, everyone.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Stericycle Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ms. Laura Murphy, Vice President of Finance, you may begin your conference call.", "Laura A. Murphy", "Welcome to Stericycle's quarterly conference call. Joining me on today's call will be Frank Ten Brink, CFO; Rich Kogler, COO; Charlie Alutto, CEO-elect; and Mark Miller, Chairman and CEO. I will now read the Safe Harbor statement. Statements by Stericycle in this conference call that are not strictly historical are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and should be viewed with caution. Factors described in this company's Form 10-K, 10-Qs, as well as its other filings with the SEC, could affect the company's actual results and could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from expected results. The company makes no commitment to disclose any revisions to forward-looking statements or any facts, events or circumstances after this date that may bear upon forward-looking statements.", "I will now turn it over to Frank.", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Thanks, Laura. The results for the second quarter are as follows: Revenues were $468.9 million, up 14.3% from $410.4 million. In Q2 of 2011, an internal growth excluding returns and recall revenues was up 8%. Domestic revenues were $337.9 million of which $308.9 million was domestic regulated waste and compliance services revenues, and $29 million was returns and recalls. Domestic internal growth, excluding returns and recall revenues was up 9%, consisting of SQ, up 10%, and LQ, up 8%; International revenues were $131.1 million and internal growth, adjusted for unfavorable exchange impact of $8.1 million, was up 5%. Acquisitions contributed $36.6 million to the growth in the quarter, of which $2.7 million related to the Recalls and Returns business.", "Gross profit was $209.5 million, or 44.7% of revenues. SG&A expense was $88 million or 18.8% of revenues. Net interest expense was $12.7 million, and net income attributable to Stericycle was $67.6 million or $0.78 per share on an as-reported basis, and $0.81 adjusted for acquisition and other non-recurring expenses.", "Now the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, the revolver borrowings were approximately $516 million. The unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $328 million. Our capital spend in the quarter was $16.8 million. And our DSO was 58 days. Q2 year-to-date, the cash provided from operations was $188.8 million, which includes $9 million of cash received in the second quarter from a customer to be used for recall product reimbursement. I will now turn it over to Rich.", "Richard T. Kogler", "Thanks, Frank. Worldwide, we continue to use our strong free cash flow to drive our grow-through acquisitions. In the quarter, we closed 8 transactions, 3 domestic and 5 international. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 535,000 accounts, of which over 519,000 were Small and the remainder were Large. Our customers continue to be excited about our expanding portfolio of services. For our SQ customers, these services include Steri-Safe and clinical compliance offerings. And for our LQ customers, the growth drivers are Sharps Management, Pharma Waste and Integrated Waste Services. The strong growth we experienced in the quarter was fueled by the continued adoption of these additional service offerings.", "We remain very excited about our future growth opportunity because 80% of our LQ and 70% of our SQ customers only use one of our current service offerings. As customers adopt our multiple services, this can more than double or triple their revenues. For 2012, we anticipate internal growth rates for SQ to be at 8% to 10%; LQ, 5% to 8%; International, 5% to 8%; and Recall and Returns revenues between $110 million and $120 million.", "We want to thank each member of our worldwide team for their strong performance and continued commitment to our customers and shareholders. A special thanks to our Spanish team for their great cash collections efforts in the quarter. I'll turn it over to Charlie.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Thanks, Rich. I would now like to provide insight on our current outlook for 2012. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements. Revenues from acquisitions completed in the quarter were approximately $3 million and annualized are approximately $41 million. Keep in mind our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures and acquisition expenses.", "For 2012, we believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $3.26 to $3.29, which we are comfortable with. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2012 will be in the range of $1.86 billion to $1.9 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange rates. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow between $322 million to $330 million, with CapEx anticipated between $63 million to $65 million.", "In closing, we are very pleased with our Q2 results and excited about the multiple growth opportunities for 2012 and beyond. Thank you for your time today. We'll now answer any questions. Mike, you can open up the Q&A queue.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels from William Blair.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Yes, let me get a couple of quick housekeeping out of the way. Frank, can you walk us through the gross margin performance during the quarter, going through some of the various puts and takes that moved that up and down with FX and mix shift and acquisitions?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes. So we ended the last quarter at 44.6%. The Large retail and healthcare contracts that we also talked about last had about a 0.2% negative impact. Foreign exchange was about an 8 basis points positive. And then growth in the business and other factors added about 0.2% and that gets you to your 44.7%.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay, perfect. And then any more color on the M&A activity? It sounds like not a lot of contribution this quarter, but a pretty good acquired run rate. I'm curious, you can go through internationally and maybe where those are located, and then in the U.S., the 3, are those Medical Waste, Patient Communication, any color there?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "So there is 8 acquisitions, there were 3 domestic, 5 international. The international ones, there were 3 in Spain, 1 in the U.K., 1 in Argentina. And then of the $41.6 million in the -- that was the total for annualized revenue. In total there were 6 regulated waste and 2 PC, Patient Communication deals.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay, perfect. And then you mentioned the strong collection efforts in Spain. I'm curious outside of FX headwinds you saw. Are you having any issues with the macro storm over there, be it collections or slowing organic growth? Just kind of what's the outlook for the International operations at Stericycle?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "So we had a very good collection quarter in Spain, which resulted in our DSO coming down 2 days. Spain is performing totally on track. They've completed, as I mentioned, 3 additional acquisitions in Q2. On the overall European marketplace, we do think that the assets that potentially are available, that's positive in a turbulent market, that may become for sale and it gives us an opportunity. And I think Spain is a good example of that. We see opportunities into new services. Overall, the volumes are fairly steady and our multiple services strategy is helping us reduce cost for our customers.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay, perfect. And then the last one, I'll hop off into the queue. Health care waste solutions, I know we're anniversarying that in the second quarter with the year since it's being closed. I think you've had somewhat of an approach to be more hands-off on cross-selling and up selling within the first year. So I'm curious now that you've anniversary-ed that, is it helping drive growth in the LQ where you're selling more into that customer base?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes, and so Healthcare Waste Solutions on track, did perform as to the synergies that we thought out of that transaction. Cross selling started there probably a little bit sooner, but they already had a strong cross sell with there own resource management tool that we have now blended with ours, so it's a little bit less of a timing thing there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk from Wedbush Securities.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Just a fairly softball question actually. In the first quarter's Q, you disclosed a deposit for a pending acquisition, was that utilized in the quarter? Or applied in the quarter? Or where -- what did that relate to?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "No, we had a small escrow there. It's associated with the future acquisition. It has yet closed at this time. It's not that material.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Right, understand. And then just to clarify, the acquisition revenue in the quarter was what?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "$3 million. So the deals we closed in the quarter contributed $3 million to the revenues.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and then on the press release though, that was last year, the $36 million, is that right?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "That's year-over-year, yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Todd Levine from JPMorgan.", "Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "It's Scott Levine. So my question with regard to the margins which trended up sequentially on a gross basis. I'm not sure if you had mentioned this in response to an earlier question, but do you have the fuel as a percent of revenue or maybe an indication as to how much of a beneficial impact that was?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "I think fuel as a total maybe contributed about 0.1% favorably to the overall gross margin. If you look at it on a pure measurement on those parts of the business that are energy and fuel dependent, we went from 5.8% to that revenue to 5.6%, but that is not all the revenues within the company.", "Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And did you give the leverage calculation of debt to EBITDA?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Debt to EBITDA was at 2.33. And there again, we have our average cost of ForEx right now at about 3.4%. Again with long-term fixed-rates continuing to get lower, we really also continue to evaluate to term some of that debt out maybe in the future.", "Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Got it. And can you give us of the size of all the acquisitions you've done recently in Spain? How large is the revenue base there, roughly at this point?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "We don't break out individual countries. It is part of our segment called Europe as a whole.", "Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Got it. And then anything new with respect to the Ecowaste divestiture?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, on the Ecowaste divestiture, based on the CC ruling, we are in the process of divesting that asset. We expect to complete that by the end of the third quarter.", "Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Rough idea of how much revenue associated with that?", "Charles A. Alutto", "If you think on the revenues associated with that, it was immaterial, it was GBP 1.8 million on the revenue side.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "On, I think you said 2 acquisitions in the quarter in Patient Communication. Sorry, could you give us an update? I got the sense that this year was going to be a feel out for integration and how well, how quickly you could ramp that up. Could you just give us a progress report there?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, I mean we continue in 2012, as you know, to build out that platform. Add some service capabilities and continue to look at how we can sell this to our current customer base, and at the same time how do we integrate these acquisitions that we required over time. Still early. We remain excited about the opportunity, though.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. I mean, should we anticipate a greater mix of acquisitions in the near term, or is that something a little bit farther out?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "I would stay put on that, I mean, you'll see.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Comments on recall in the quarter, it was above what we were expecting. Could you just give us a feel for what the environment is right now and are there any big projects that may trickle into the coming quarter?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "No, our guidance is 110 to 120, so the same. So the expectations are still the same as the last quarter. It's a business where you don't totally know yet what next quarter is, but we feel that the business keeps running as expected according to that guidance.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then lastly, this Alameda County vote and the implications of a potential ordinance to tell pharmaceutical companies that they'd have to pay to get rid of pharmaceuticals. Could you just give us your thoughts on, I think that was unprecedented, and if this becomes a norm, if this is something that gets pursued, what are your views on how it might affect your business?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, Scott, as you know, first of all, in the pharmaceutical waste opportunity, we focused on the hospital market, a little bit on the SQ market. We monitor the household pharmaceuticals, the ordinance that you're referring to in California, that's not unique. There's been some talk around the country, in some states and also some municipalities to implement that and hold the pharmaceuticals accountable to pay for that proper disposal. I think it's too early to tell if that will become a trend or not. Obviously, the more regulations that come around household pharmaceutical, it could become an opportunity for us in the future, but right now our focus has been on our core business, which is the LQ and the SQ side.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Erin Wilson from Bank of America.", "Erin  E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "A quick question on Patient Communications. Do you ever plan on, I guess, breaking that contribution out on a quarterly basis, I guess, when it comes to some sort of critical level?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "It's not material yet for us to break it out, and again, there's pretty straightforward SEC rules when something is material, and then it will be.", "Erin  E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And I noticed that Sharps Compliance launched their web-based OSHA Compliance on blood-borne pathogens training program, is there any sort of -- do you have any concern, I guess, about that or to -- are you seeing others out there that are their bolstering up their ancillary services offerings?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, there's been a lot, I mean over the years many companies have offered a compliance program, so we don't see the market changing all that much. We saw that as well, but that's been ongoing from different competitors around the market place. We continue to look at our program, make enhancements to it. Our program looks a lot different every year by adding additional services and capabilities to our own program.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.", "James Francescone - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "It's actually James in for David. First just a question on operating margin and how you're expecting those to trend through the rest of the year. For the first half of 2012, it looks like EBIT margins are down around 70 bps year-over-year. I haven't had quite had the time to run the calculations on what your guidance for the back half implies, but it does sound like you're expecting some improvements. What would be the big drivers there?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "I think, obviously our continued drivers are selling services that have higher margins, making the improvements on acquisitions that we've made from a synergistic point of view. The guidance on the gross margin level is sequentially about 10 to 20 basis points improvement quarter-over-quarter. In Q3, there's not a lot of change with respect to that because the acquisitions that we did in the prior quarter don't have really a changing effect on that trend. If you look at overall the SG&A levels, they probably are going to stay fairly close to the level we're at right now, coming down slightly between now and the end of the year.", "James Francescone - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then a question on tax, could you break out what the non-GAAP or adjusted tax rate was in the quarter? Mostly that might have been a little bit lower than it usually has, and I'm wondering if there were any one-time impacts in there?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "No, so the as reported for the year-to-date is about 35.9%, and that's what we anticipate the range for the year to be at about that 36%.", "James Francescone - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then on currency, could you, one, from a high level perspective, what's your approach to managing currency risk, either considering natural or synthetic hedges? And could you give us some sense of what the FX outlook is like for the rest of the year at current rates?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "So if you think about our business, it's really a service business. So we are naturally hedged in each country. We don't make products in one country and send it to another. Our risk is really consolidation which you don't hedge for. The outlook for the year, it's everyone's crystal ball. We really look at where rates are right now, trying to not get too fancy in the future. We do think, if you think about the rest of the year, there was about $23 million added from a point of view of acquisitions. It definitely in the second half will have a little bit of an impact because the euro has certainly dropped a little bit. So in the guidance setting, it probably was about a $13.5 million impact versus our previous guidance.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Manthey from Robert W. Baird.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "First off, could you talk about your hit rate selling some of these ancillary services to med waste customers that you've had for a while, maybe 2 or 3 years. And if you compare that to your hit rate of acquired customers, let's say, that you've gotten through acquisitions over the past year?", "Richard T. Kogler", "I mean, I think like we've said for quite a few years, once a customer becomes a Stericycle customer after an acquisition, then we bring them into the fold, introduce them to our services, our sales people begin to contact them. But I can kind of give you an anecdote. I mean, year-to-date right now, I think we've talked about this on some prior calls. One of our multiple services, the Pharma Waste service, where our installations in hospitals are up 20% this year versus last year. And I guess just another anecdote is that our sales team as a whole is running above their internal plan. And you see this reflected in the growth rates for the company, SQ and LQ, which are sort of at the higher end of our range.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And second, I was wondering if you could discuss the pace of the mix shift you see from Large Quantity to Small Quantity customers within your international markets. And if you could compare and contrast that with the historical pace of U.S. conversion?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "A good example of that is the U.K. where right now the SQ is in the low 30s as a percent of revenues to the total revenues for SQ. When we purchased that business, it was nearly only 2% and that was in the '05, '06 timeframe. So that kind of gives you a period of time through which the business has fairly dramatically already shifted. Spain is a good second example. A little too early, but we've done some acquisitions in the SQ sphere, and that has started to build density up and they are definitely ahead of their numbers and on track. So it is working and we'll continue to work the system to make the SQ a larger part of the businesses overseas.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Greg Halter from Great Lakes Review.", "Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review", "Relative to the operating -- the FX impact, I should say, $8.1 million on sales, what kind of impact did that have on operating income?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "I mean if you think about our International business, it's predominantly LQ in larger percent, so the impact is far less. Probably about at the end, somewhere in the area of $0.01 to $0.02, if you think about it from an entire year point of view in the guidance. So what we had is 3 24 to 3 28 before $0.01 to $0.02 is the impact on a full-year basis.", "Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review", "Which is a negative impact, correct?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "That is correct.", "Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review", "Okay. And just wondered if you could provide any insights into what you're seeing competitive -- on a competitive nature either domestically, or I should say, and domestically, as well as internationally?", "Richard T. Kogler", "Well, I think you, as you've heard us say many times, it's a very competitive business with a lot of competitors large and small. That being said, we continue to manage our way through. And our sales team does a good job. And I, again, I think you see it in our growth rates. But this is a business where people will always be looking to try to enter, and that's the American way.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Just to follow-up on a question that was just asked. The currency headwinds are affecting your guidance negatively by $0.01 to $0.02 for the year, is that correct?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "That is correct.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And am I understanding this right, that the tax rate guidance went from $0.37 to $0.36, which is a positive impact of what, $0.04 to $0.05?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Now if you looked -- we, last time, said in the guidance that the tax rate was somewhere in the mid-36s, and now it's about 36 for the year. You may and did get $0.01 out of that in Q2. A little bit just on a year-to-date basis, that probably is half a penny to $0.01 in the second half. And then you have your acquisitions that are adding $0.01 to $0.01 and thatkind of upsets the $0.01 to $0.02 headwinds on the foreign exchange.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "So if I'm looking is for, instead of a ding of 37 being 36.5, so that's about a good two and half cents, so you assume that, that's kind of a little bit more than what we're getting or roughly the same as what we're getting from offsetting the FFX, is that right?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "I don't think the math is right that you're doing because in the first quarter we were a little bit below the 37, and at that point the guidance that we had set was, let's say used the mid-36s.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. I'll go back to that. Then can you just give some of the dynamics on what's going in SG&A. The gross margin's obviously moving up, and you're seeing the EBIT margin moving down. I was wondering, is there a timing of acquisitions? You did a lot more acquisition this quarter than the last quarter. Are we seeing some of the timing impact the SG&A that's moving the margin down?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes, we did have the investment in our large retail and healthcare contracts that are kind of starting up. The acquisition mix impacted debt slightly from a percentage. And then we did, because we were ahead of the game, did some strategic investment spend in growth initiatives.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Could you just give us an example of what strategic investment spend might be?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Well, those are investments in our programs like Steri-Safe and factors of how we can make improvements in our business. There's always a list of activities that we have that we would like to do, but we want to be sure that they're not totally negatively impacting that we're doing, trend-wise.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and in terms of the acquisition revenue contribution, I think someone might have alluded to this earlier. I'm seeing just the last 3 quarters, kind of a decline, is that on a sequential basis? Is the right way to look at that, that things are just bumpy and you don't close acquisitions in -- on a straight-line basis. Or is it really just the pipeline of acquisitions is changing? Or the ones you're going after are smaller?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "No, I think you need to look at 2 different numbers. So in the quarter, the contribution to growth was $36.6 million. That's the difference between how much the revenues were on acquisitions that have not been yet in the business for 12 months between last year and this year. In the quarter itself, we had $46.5 million in revenues and acquisitions. But in the prior year, there was $9.9 million. A lot of that was attributable to the HWS transaction. So the contribution to growth is $36.6 million, but in the quarter itself, it was $46.5 million.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Steinke from Barrington Research.", "Kevin M. Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "I just wanted to follow-up on energy a little bit and with fuel prices coming down recently, does that have any impact on your outlook for fuel surcharges in the second half of the year, or is it not a material enough a move to make a difference there?", "Richard T. Kogler", "Well, energy was down just slightly from 5.8% to 5.6% of revenue for the revenues that are affected by transportation for the quarter. We have surcharges that are tied to our contract language. And of course as fuels decline, then the surcharges would tend to roll off. And I guess it's anybody's guess though what fuel's going to do. So if it moves up, our contracts also give us the flexibility to deal with that.", "Kevin M. Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then internationally, are you still in the process of renegotiating or discontinuing LQ contracts that are lower margin and kind of how far along are you in that process? Or is that just kind of an ongoing process?", "Richard T. Kogler", "No, it's actually an ongoing process, because you're dealing with large customers and there's contract terms. And as we kind of work through the process a while back here in the States, it's something that takes place over time. And then as you acquire new contracts, you continue to work through those, so would I guess, I would characterize it as ongoing.", "Kevin M. Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. But there is not necessarily a large chunk right now that you'd like to work through and then that eventually tapers off, and it's just more one-offers?", "Richard T. Kogler", "it's a continual program, and as I said, as new contracts come into the fold, through acquisitions will work those too.", "Kevin M. Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Great. Okay, one last one. I'm wondering if you have any breakout on LQ versus SQ for the regulated waste acquisitions that were done during the quarter?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "It was about 58%, 60% SQ and 42% LQ.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Richard Close from Avondale Partners.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Just really a quick couple of questions here. On the pharmaceutical waste, if you can just update us again on the market size there and where you think, in terms of revenues, where you -- how far you're penetrated?", "Richard T. Kogler", "Well, I think the market, as we said before, is equivalent or larger than the Biosystems market. Which means it's probably $200 million-plus. We continue to have good success, and see high demand. This is also program that may have applicability in other international markets. So I think from a penetration standpoint, we still have a lot of runway.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "And just to be clear, when you said, I think you mentioned the hospital market, you're up 20% or so year-to-date with -- in the Large, I guess, Large Quantity of pharmaceutical waste. Are you doing anything with local governments? I know you talked a little bit about this earlier. Are you doing any type of contracting with local governments?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, we do a little bit on the SQ side of the house where we have some doctors that have some pharmaceutical waste. We do have a program for that, that's included in the SQ growth. Some municipalities, on some of their hazardous waste collection days, we're contracted to take away some of those pharmaceuticals. It's not a big part of the business. We also handle pharmaceutical waste coming out of pharmacies and retail chain customers. So there's other opportunities. The big one right now is in the hospital space. We think it's one of the bigger markets, and that's why we spent a lot of time focusing on that part of the business.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, and then with that being up 20% year-to-date? I'm curious, as contracts, Large Quantity contracts or hospital contracts come up for bid, how would that -- what percentage when you renew a contract or rewin one, what percentage are you selling multiple services here domestically?", "Charles A. Alutto", "So our multiple services -- yes, our multiple services domestically, we're -- those services are available to all of our hospitals. So it's not when a renewal comes up. With respect to, when a renewal comes up, these are normally separate contracts, so we have a separate contract for regulated medical waste, a separate contract for pharmaceutical waste, for our sharp service. So that's not really, when we're waiting for the renewal, for an opportunity to sell the additional services to that customer.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. I guess I'm trying to get a feel of how much the market is going to a fully bundled service offering and how that is developing in terms of the full bundled services?", "Richard T. Kogler", "I don't think it's a bundled service in the classic since of that term. As Charlie just said, these are multiple services that customers can opt to take individually or they can take all 3 or all 5 or whatever we're offering. We're not bundling, and I don't really see the market going to a bundled mode. That's just -- that's how we're seeing things right now.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And one final question. I know we've had a lot here, but with the acquisition revenue that you guys called out, you mentioned something with respect to recalls, was there an acquisition on the Returns Management Recalls business?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "No. The one that we mentioned is sometimes needed to calculate the internal growth matters, so that's why I gave the number, but this is an acquisition that was done in prior quarters.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to the presenters.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Great, thanks, Mike. I want to thank everybody participating on today's call. Enjoy the rest of the summer. And we'll speak to everybody again in October. Have a great night.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Stericycle's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Ms. Laura Murphy, VP of Finance, you may begin your conference call.", "Laura A. Murphy", "Welcome to Stericycle's quarterly conference call. Joining me on today's call will be Frank Ten Brink, CFO; Rich Kogler, COO; Charlie Alutto, CEO-elect; and Mark Miller, Chairman and CEO.", "I will now read the Safe Harbor statement. Statements by Stericycle in this conference call that are not strictly historical are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and should be viewed with caution. Factors described in the company's Form 10-K, 10-Qs, as well as its other filings with the SEC, could affect the company's actual results and could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from expected results. The company makes no commitment to disclose any revisions to forward-looking statements or any facts, events or circumstances after this date that may bear upon forward-looking statements.", "I will now turn it over to Frank.", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Thanks, Laura. The results for the third quarter are as follows: Revenues were $480.5 million, up 14.2% from $420.9 million in Q3 '11. And internal growth, excluding returns and recall revenues, was up 8.5%. Domestic revenues were $348.2 million, of which $319.5 million was domestic regulated waste and compliance services and $28.7 million was returns and recalls. Domestic internal growth, excluding returns and recalls revenues, was up over 10% consisting of SQ up 11%, and LQ up 9%. International revenues were $132.3 million and internal growth, adjusted for unfavorable exchange impact of $8 million, was up 4%. Acquisitions contributed $31.5 million to the growth in the quarter, of which $0.6 million related to the recalls and returns business.", "Gross profit was $215.6 million or 44.9% of revenues. And SG&A expense was $90.2 million, or 18.8% of revenues. Net interest expense was $12.9 million and the net income attributable to Stericycle was $65.5 million or $0.75 per share on a reported basis and $0.84 adjusted for acquisitions and other nonrecurring expenses.", "Now the balance sheet. Our covenant debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.22 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $610 million. On October 22, we signed 2 private placements for a total of $250 million. This includes a $125-million, 7-year note at a rate of 2.68% and a $125-million 10-year note at a rate of 3.26%. The proceeds will be used to reduce existing borrowings.", "In the quarter, we repurchased 43,500 shares of common stock in the open market in an amount of $3.9 million, and we have authorization to purchase an additional 4.2 million shares. Our capital spending was $17.8 million, our DSO was 60 days and Q3 year-to-date cash provided from operations was $277 million.", "And I will now turn it over to Rich.", "Richard T. Kogler", "Thanks, Frank. Worldwide, we continue to use our strong free cash flow to drive our growth through acquisitions. In the quarter, we closed 12 transactions, 3 domestic and 9 international. Our worldwide acquisition pool room remains robust with over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 537,000 accounts, of which over 521,000 were small and the remainder were large.", "The strong internal growth rates we experienced in this quarter resulted from more and more customers adopting our expanding portfolio of offerings. For our SQ customers, these include Steri-Safe and other compliance services; and for our LQ customers, the growth drivers are Sharps Management, Pharma Waste and Integrated Waste Solutions. We remain very excited about our future growth because today, 80% of our LQ and 70% of our SQ customers only use one of our current service offerings. And as customers adopt our multiple services, this can more than double or triple their revenues.", "We want to take this opportunity to thank each member of our worldwide team for their strong performance and continued commitment to our customers and our shareholders. I'll now turn it over to Charlie.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Thanks, Rich. I would now like to provide insight on our current outlook for 2012 and 2013. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements.", "Revenues from acquisitions completed in the quarter were approximately $3.8 million, and annualized, are approximately $33.7 million. Keep in mind, our 2012 guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, acquisition-related and other nonrecurring expenses. For 2012, we believe analysts' EPS estimates will be in the range of $3.27 to $3.29, which we are comfortable with. We believe analysts' revenue estimates for 2012 will be in the range of $1.87 billion to $1.9 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange rates. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow between $319 million to $327 million, with CapEx anticipated between $65 million to $68 million.", "Now I'd like to provide a preliminary outlook for 2013. Keep in mind our 2013 guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration, acquisition-related and other nonrecurring expenses.", "We believe analysts' EPS estimates will be in the range of $3.62 to $3.67, including the impact of the private placement and a share count of 87.5 million, which we are comfortable with. We believe analysts' revenue estimates for 2013 will be in the range of $2.06 billion to $2.09 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange rates. We anticipate 2013 internal growth rates to be: SQ, 8% to 10%; LQ, 5% to 8%; international, 5% to 8%; and recall and returns revenues between $105 million and $120 million. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow between $350 million to $355 million. CapEx is anticipated to be between $65 million to $70 million.", "In closing, we are very pleased with our Q3 results and excited about the multiple growth opportunities for 2012 and beyond. Thank you for your time. We'll now open it up to Q&A. Mike, you can open up the Q&A line.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels from William Blair.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Question, in regards to the accelerating organic growth you're seeing, I know you pointed out it's stemming from a lot of the cross-selling opportunities into the existing client base, but is there anything novel you're doing on the sales front or bundling those? I mean, we've always had those opportunities, but growth seems to keep ticking up throughout the year, so I'm curious if it's macro trends or anything internally you are doing different?", "Charles A. Alutto", "No, Ryan. It's the same concept on our sales strategy for both SQ and LQ. Obviously, we've got a good value proposition for our SQ and LQ customers. And the accelerated growth you see is the same formula we've followed for many, many years. That strategy has not changed except we're getting a higher acceptance rate on those offerings.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then, Frank, maybe one for you in regards to the debt placement. We clearly didn't have that in the model. I'm curious what the trade-off on that debt is versus the debt you paid down and what that does on a forward EPS basis, if you can give us a feel for that.", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "On a forward EPS, I would say for '13, the comparison between either borrowing under the revolver, which would we otherwise would have done, or now with the private placement, it's the equivalent of about $0.025 diluted. So a higher interest expense by about $3.5 million pretax.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay, perfect. And then, I guess one last one and I'll hop off. In regards to the patient communications business, we tend to ask this every quarter, but can you give us a little bit more color there on how that's progressing? I know this was going to be a year of making sure you could integrate it well and drive organic growth. Are we ready to see that accelerate from an M&A or organic growth standpoint if we think about your 2013 expectations?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Sure, Ryan. I think if you look back, what we've always said about 2012 for patient communication, it's a year that we'll spend looking at integrating those acquisitions that we've already completed to date, adding service capabilities to the platform of services and then piling certain sales activities with respect to our existing sales team and leveraging that relationship for our customers. Obviously, we're 10 months through the year. We're on track. We look at this as the assumptions we made going into this business. We validated those assumptions throughout the year. We remain very excited about the opportunity. And I think if you look at how do you take that for next year, I think we'll look at M&A continuing in that space at this point.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Levine from JPMorgan.", "Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Question, I guess, on the general spending environment on the LQ side in particular, but SQ as well. Are you seeing any impact in terms of spending levels or appetite for your services? It sounds like you saw some acceleration on the add-on side. Your guidance seems to imply your typical growth rate. So I'm just wondering whether there is any general change in the business environment or customer receptivity to services?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "The overall guidance we've given, I mean, it's really -- it may prove to be conservative, but I think, overall, that the trends are normal. We don't see any major changes. Good growth in the quarter, nice acceleration during this year, quarter-to-quarter a little bit, so we're on track we feel.", "Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Got it. And maybe a little bit more color, then, on which add-on services or multiservice offerings, just maybe seeing a little bit more penetration with and additional detail perhaps with regard to the Patient Notification rollout. And I'm guessing you won't provide quantified guidance for what that might mean for '13, but maybe a little bit more color regarding individual service offerings and uptake there.", "Richard T. Kogler", "This is Rich. I think Rx Waste, Pharma Waste as we call it, has been a very, very strong performer this year. We're already well ahead of the sales closes and the installations and therefore the revenue inbound, compared to where we were in 2011.", "Charles A. Alutto", "And I think on patient communications, Scott, you'll see that 2013 will be more M&A adding service capabilities to that platform. And then we'll see more internal growth efforts in the 2014 time frame, when we talk about patient communications.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk from Wedbush Securities.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "In terms of the patient communication, just a clarification. So if it's service-oriented, does that imply it's -- there's not necessarily a lot of technology that you're looking at, but more it's a customer base?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "No, it's both. I mean, obviously there's technology in both, in the relationship and the communication tools that we use, the call center technology that's in place. That is being expanded over the call centers. We have the integration of those call centers. It's going to be obviously important that we're learning a lot there and doing things on that front. So it's both the technology component that's improving over time that creates efficiencies, that creates integration and also more capabilities to service our customers.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "I think in the quarter, you said that acquisitions less than 12 months came through at like $31 million.", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "$31.5 million, correct.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "If we took some of the prior disclosures, that one seems to be a little bit lighter than -- maybe if you divided...", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Let me explain that out. So the way that -- that $31.5 million is the contribution to growth. So in the quarter itself, there were $42.6 million in revenues from those acquisitions, but in the year 2011 in the same quarter, there was $11 million in it. So you have the revenues in both years and the delta between those 2, the contribution to growth, it's $31.5 million.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Right. Okay. All right. I think I had another question, but -- oh, the final one I had was on -- it looks like you sold some business. I was wondering if you could talk through that, maybe not just the dollars and cents, but more the structure, the reason for maybe exiting.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Sure, Al. It's related to the divestiture of Ecowaste in the U.K. We divested a treatment location and approximately USD $2.8 million in contracts. This was a CC ruling, but it allows us to bid on these contracts in the future and there are no restrictions to future deals in the U.K. as part of this divestiture.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "What was the -- I won't say the rationale, but why are you exiting? Maybe I've missed something in the past, but...", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, this was the ruling from the Competition Commission of the U.K.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Let's -- if we could, can we start out going through the acquisitions in the quarter, the 3 in the U.S. and the 9 international? Could you guys please give us a feel for what categories those were done in?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Those were all in regulated waste. There was 1 in Romania, 1 in Portugal, 2 in the U.K., 1 in Brazil, 2 in Mexico, 2 in Chile on the international front.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "On the U.S. front, in med waste, was it SQ, LQ? Could you give us a feel for mix for both domestic and international, please, Frank?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "We don't break it between domestic and international, but for all acquisitions in the quarter, 80% was SQ roughly and 20% was LQ, from a revenue point of view.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. In all med waste, curious, and Charlie kind of covered it in the prior question, but just interesting nothing was done in patient communication in the quarter. Is it -- are you still in the integration phase? Charlie just mentioned '13 would be the acquisitive phase, '14 would be organic growth. Do I have that correct? And are we still 2 quarters from aggressive acquisitions in PC?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes, PC, obviously, is one where we said we would build the platform, but we are continuously looking for acquisitions. And it's one that we've done some this year and we will continue to look for those.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Two more, if I could sneak it in. First one on recall. Could you give us a feel for how that's trending, anything sizable that may trickle into the next quarter? The guidance for the coming year looks about as one would expect, but just any developments there that we should be aware of, please.", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "The trend, as you saw, very strong first quarter at about almost $36 million; second quarter, $29 million; and now about $29 million. Trend is, again, not much in this business, visibility longer term. There's always a little bit of slop over into next quarter, but in general it's very stable there, very similar to prior quarters. Guidance again for this year, for 2012, between $112 million and $120 million, and then the guidance for next year, $105 million to $120 million.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "And then lastly, you've had success with a few of your recent projects such as Pharma Waste and LQs and patient communication as far as emerging. Anything new on the horizon that's worth discussing, that's far enough along to bring up on this call?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "No. Again, if there are, then we would tell you. But I think, overall, each of them, Pharma Waste, the hazardous, the Sharps Management, the compliance side, the SQ international, they're all tracking and contributing to the growth that you've seen this quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Just a couple of questions. Can you -- was the international growth 4%? Did I catch that correctly?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "That is correct.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And it's a little bit lower than what you guys normally expect. What -- is there anything in particular going on there? Or was the divestiture impacting that?", "Richard T. Kogler", "That was part of it, but also in this quarter we had a couple of hospital contract escalators that were lower than expected and that also impacted it a little bit.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "What does that mean exactly, that the escalators were lower than expected? What was going on there?", "Richard T. Kogler", "Well, I'll give you an example. In one geography, we have an escalator tied to something like a CPI or -- that's not the term they use, but it's tied to that. So hard to predict those things until you get right down to the time when the contract turns.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Is that going to impact international growth going forward? I mean, should we think of maybe the range is a little bit looser than we had expected or up until now?", "Richard T. Kogler", "No, I mean, we're providing guidance. I think Charlie mentioned 5 to 8, which is in our normal range going forward.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And is the DSO tick up sequentially Spain-related? After you got the money, it's kind of building back up again?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "No, it wasn't. September was kind of a tricky month. It ended on a weekend. It only had 19 days in it that were working days that you get money out of the banking system. So it was just a tougher month to end the quarter with. And that added about 2 days to the DSO.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And so it wasn't particular to international?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "No. I mean, it was general. There were some in domestic because of the cutoff and some in the international. They kind of equally contributed to it.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then what's going on with the tax rate exactly? Because it's a couple of quarters in a row that it's a little bit lower than what we were expecting. I mean, what kind of tax rate are you expecting for the rest of this year? And what about for next year?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "The tax rate year-to-date is about 35.6%, a little bit lower than the 36% that we said we would be at. Guidance for next year, we would still say it's approximately 36% and so it's fairly close together. A little bit of tweaking here and there, a little bit of benefits this year with some NOLs, but I think overall, the guidance for next year is 36%. We've continued to optimize our corporate structure to manage the tax rate.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And can you kind of bridge us for the parts that we might need in the organic growth calculation? Like when I just take what you put out, I get to upper 7s, and you had talked about an 8.5%. Were there certain things in recalls that happened last year that I should be paying attention to?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Sure. So the way the math works there is if you take our total revenue growth of $59.6 million, and what you've done is you obviously exclude the $31.5 million from it, and that is the delta again between $42.6 million this year in the quarter in acquisitions, minus last year in the same quarter, $11 million. You then add back the $8 million on foreign exchange. The returns management internal growth was $3 million, positive, so you deduct that because we do this calculation excluding the recalls. So that gets you to $32.9 million in kind of the growth year-over-year. And then you divide that by a number that you first look at your total revenues for '11. You again deduct that $11 million on acquisitions from it and then the internal RMS number, which is $23.1 million, and that gets you to then $386.8 million. So $32.9 million, divided by the $386.8 million, gets you to the 8.5%.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Erin Wilson from Bank of America.", "Erin  E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Sorry, can you hear me?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes, we can hear you -- now we can't.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Manthey from R.W. Baird.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I was just wondering if you could give us, Frank, the after-tax amount of the charges for the acquisition expenses, restructuring, plant closure and the sale of business, just so we can reconcile? I know you gave us the EPS impact, but sometimes there's differences in taxability and so forth.", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Let me look it up. The after-tax number, I'll get back to you on that. That was for just the Ecowaste or which one? Or total?", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Yes, I'm looking for the -- you give us the pretax amount of these charges and then you give us the EPS impact of the charges. Do they all come across at the same tax rate?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "No. The tax rate was slightly lower. The after-tax amount was about $7.5 million.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "In aggregate?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "In aggregate.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. Maybe we can follow-up with the individual categories afterwards.", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "No problem.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Erin Wilson from Bank of America.", "Erin  E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "How much was, I guess, customer mix a factor in the sequential gross margin trend?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "If you look at the gross margin, the large contracts, again, the growth there was about a 9-bp lowering of the gross margin. In the quarter, foreign exchange and acquisitions were about 5 bps lowering the margin, and then the rest of the business, the overall mix and everything else, made it 33 basis points better in the quarter. So that's quarter-over-quarter.", "Erin  E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then I was just curious what your thoughts were on the medical device reprocessing market. I assume many of the relevant devices and materials end up in your treatment facilities that could ultimately be refurbished or reprocessed. Do you have an existing effort there or maybe have any interest in establishing, I guess, a more formalized relationship with the big players like J&J or Stryker?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, Erin. We've looked at this -- we've never thought of it as a good fit to be in the medical device reprocessing business. But you're right; a lot of those devices that can be reprocessed do wind up in the medical waste containers. Hospitals don't do to a very good job of segregating that material out. We are piloting right now with some of the major players in that space on trying to recapture that material from the waste stream and get it to them. It helps health care. There's a shortage of medical devices, from our understanding, that can be reprocessed. So early phases of piling right now. We think it will be good for our customers, good for the environment to get that material into the hands of the reprocessors. So nothing material, but certainly, we are piloting those efforts right now.", "Erin  E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Could you quantify, maybe, the overall market opportunity associated with that?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Too early to tell.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Lou Char [ph] from S&P Capital.", "Stewart Scharf - S&P Equity Research", "Stewart Scharf. Regarding the regions in Europe and the impact, especially like in Spain and the U.K., could you guys break that down a little bit?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "We don't break by country. Overall, in the segment reporting itself, Europe in total was about $72.7 million in revenues and the other international locations were at $59.6 million in revenues.", "Stewart Scharf - S&P Equity Research", "Okay. And regarding the call centers, could you elaborate a little more on that as far as the number of people and how you're allocating patient communications and so forth?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "The call centers that we have, obviously at this point have been acquired, which obviously, where there's lots of resource that we're now trying to optimize not only their efficiency but also the tools that they use, the infrastructure and technology that they use to do their business. And so all those efforts allow us to improve that business and to look for integration there and to also add additional services to that over time.", "Stewart Scharf - S&P Equity Research", "Okay. And also regarding the multiple services -- and you've said for a while that the SQ was basically 80% for the single serve and for the LQ around 70%. And do you have a time frame or a goal for expanding that to multiple services and improving that percentage?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "The percentage heavily depends on obviously how many customers we acquire. And because we keep acquiring customers on a worldwide basis, the opportunity remains really open to us and the percentage is very close every quarter-to-quarter. The number isn't changing, which on the one side you would maybe say, \"Well, what is it going to do? Where are you going to take it?\" Again, because of our continued acquisition, that number and that opportunity that we have remains very large for us.", "Stewart Scharf - S&P Equity Research", "Okay. And just one more quick one, regarding the elections. And I know that's not a major driver for what you're looking at. You're looking more at the baby-boom and the long term. But assuming there was Obamacare and there was a shift from, say, emergency rooms to smaller clinics, is there any way to quantify that?", "Charles A. Alutto", "We haven't really quantified. We think the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, obviously, we anticipate more people being insured. To your point, that probably does move volumes from the emergency room to SQ, which we think is good for us. It gives us the opportunity to sell more services. That should be favorable. If we look at Massachusetts, and a lot of people point to Massachusetts, because they do have a similar type of health-care system, the studies that we've done internally, we have seen volumes increasing, especially in the SQ world, in that state. So we look at that as a favorable outcome. So we'll see. It's too early to tell, but that's one thing that we can point to as something that's been favorable for us.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Barbara Noverini from Morningstar.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Could you give us maybe some color, or an update on the competitive dynamics of the Pharma Waste space? Have you been seeing competition heat up, maybe some new entrants into the market given the relatively attractive opportunity going forward?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. I think if you look at the competitive landscape for Pharma Waste -- and when we look at Pharma Waste, we're specifically looking at LQ, the hospital market. You have a lot of regional companies, regional hazardous-waste companies that are in that space. And then on a national or semi-national platform, folks like waste management and clean harbors, I think the advantage that we have is the relationships that we have within health care. So I think, quickly, we've taken a leadership position for that type of service offering and when we look at the opportunity we have, when a hospital does outsource that program, we do close a large percentage of those accounts. And I think that's because of the leadership position we have within health care.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And how would you say the rate of growth of Pharma Waste compares with the other services available to LQ customers?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "It's at a higher growth rate, but it's also -- we're in an earlier inning there.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Richard Close.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Just a follow-up on that. Did you say what your penetration rate was on Rx Waste with your customers? Have you given that?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "No, we did not.", "Charles A. Alutto", "We're in the early stages of that service offering.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then when we think of patient communications -- and I know obviously a lot of talk there. Just to be clear, there was not any acquisitions in the patient communications in the third quarter. That's correct.", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "That is correct.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And on a go-forward basis, can you give us a little bit of, I guess, update with respect to when do you expect -- or maybe you won't do this, but brand this as \"Stericycle Patient Communications?\" Or are these acquisitions you've done still operating as the -- under the existing names?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. I think it's a mix. We have certainly the platform acquisition that we did, which was NotifyMD. We continue to use that name. Some of the acquisitions that we have completed, we have branded them NotifyMD, but not all. I think it's too early to tell. We're looking still from -- and that's as far as the piloting on the sales and marketing strategy on how do we brand that service offering.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And is there any opportunity for the patient communications to be leveraged into the LQ base? I would assume you have some national accounts that this would be an attractive service for.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Oh, absolutely. I mean, in the acquisitions we've made, there've been both LQ and SQ customers. I think the LQ one is interesting. From the Affordable Care Act and the way that hospitals are being reimbursed, there is certainly an opportunity that now that it's based on patient satisfaction and outcomes, that how a hospital communicates with the patients -- there's been a lot of white papers. The better that they communicate with their patients, the better the outcome. So we think there could be some great opportunities on the LQ side. But right now, the focus has been mostly on the SQ side.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then any update with respect to the ability to, I guess, ramp up the SQ on the international front, how that is progressing?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "That's on track. I mean, there is definitely focus. As we've said in the past, the equivalent of Steri-Safe is expanded internationally and it's called to the compliance program there. So it definitely is on track and continues to grow there.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then final question for me. I would be interested in hearing your thoughts on the retail front. I think you guys have been doing some business with respect to national accounts on returns or waste disposal on large retail customers. Any thoughts on that?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. If we could remind everybody again on the StrongPak offering, it's a unique offering, assisting retail to dispose of both hazardous waste and Rx Waste. We continue to build off our med waste offering. So we do have good coverage in accounts in the retail space. We're picking up items like med waste and pharmaceutical waste. So we continue to see a lot of regulatory compliance, and retail is getting a lot of focus in this area. And where there's opportunities, we're out in the marketplace trying to expand that service offering. We're excited about that offering.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to the presenters.", "Unknown Executive", "We thank everybody for joining the call. Next week -- always drive safe, but please next week be very alert for trick-or-treaters. And one last thing: please remember to get out and vote. Thank you, everyone.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.

Incorporated, Research Division", "Operator", "Good afternoon. My name is Kyle, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Fourth Quarter 2012 Stericycle Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Laura Murphy, Vice President of Finance.", "Laura A. Murphy", "Welcome to Stericycle's quarterly conference call. Joining me on today's call will be Frank Ten Brink, CFO; Rich Kogler, COO; and Charlie Alutto, CEO.", "I will now read the Safe Harbor statement. Statements by Stericycle in this conference call that are not strictly historical are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and should be viewed with caution. Factors described in the company's Form 10-K, 10-Qs, as well as its other filings with the SEC, could affect the company's actual results and could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from expected results. The company makes no commitment to disclose any revisions to forward-looking statements or any facts, events or circumstances after this date that may bear upon forward-looking statements.", "I will now turn it over to Frank.", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Thank you, Laura. The results for the fourth quarter are as follows: Revenues were $503.6 million, up 12.8% from $446.6 million in Q4 of '12; and internal growth, excluding returns and recall revenues, was up 8.4%. Domestic revenues were $355.6 million, of which $332.7 million was domestic regulated waste and compliance services and $22.8 million was recalls and returns. Domestic internal growth, excluding recalls and returns revenue, was up 10%, consisting of SQ up 11% and LQ up 9%.", "International revenues were $148.1 million, and internal growth adjusted for unfavorable exchange impact of $2.3 million was up 5%. Acquisitions contributed $31.1 million to the growth in the quarter. The gross profit was $227 million or 45.1% of revenues. SG&A expense, including amortization, was $95.6 million or 19% of revenues. Net interest expense was $13 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $70.1 million or $0.80 per share on an as-reported basis and $0.88 adjusted for acquisitions and other nonrecurring expenses.", "On the balance sheet. Our covenant debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.24 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $616 million. In the quarter, we repurchased 457,156 shares of common stock in the open market in an amount of $41.2 million, and we have authorization to purchase an additional 3.8 million shares. Our capital spend was $13.6 million, and our DSO was 59 days. The full year cash provided from operations was $387.4 million.", "And I will now turn it over to Rich.", "Richard T. Kogler", "Thanks, Frank. Worldwide, we continue to use our strong free cash flow to drive our growth through acquisitions. In the quarter, we closed 10 transactions, 5 domestic and 5 international. The international acquisitions consisted of 2 in Spain, 2 in the United Kingdom and 1 in Chile. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 541,000 accounts, of which, approximately 525,000 were small and the remainder were large.", "The strong internal growth rates we experienced in this quarter resulted from more and more customers adopting our multiple services. One of our newer services contributing to growth is StrongPak. StrongPak is one of our regulated waste service offerings which helps retailers manage hazardous and pharmaceutical waste in a compliant manner. Increased regulatory scrutiny and fines for noncompliance have driven demand for StrongPak. We're excited about our future growth because our customers continue to adopt additional services such as StrongPak. These additional services can more than double or triple existing customer revenues.", "In closing, we want to thank our worldwide team for their strong performance in 2012. We're especially proud of our team members who were impacted by Hurricane Sandy. They continue to support our customers while their own lives were disrupted by the storm. Their actions demonstrate their strong commitment to our customers and their fellow team members.", "Now I'll turn it over to Charlie.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Thanks, Rich. I would now like to provide insight on our current outlook for 2013. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements.", "Revenues from the 10 acquisitions were approximately $8.4 million in Q4, and annualized are approximately $50.5 million. Keep in mind, our 2013 guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration and acquisition-related and other nonrecurring expenses. We believe analysts' EPS estimates will be in the range of $3.65 to $3.69, including the impact of the private placement which was funded in Q4. We believe analysts' revenue estimates for 2013 will be in the range of $2.11 billion to $2.14 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange rates.", "We anticipate 2013 internal growth rates to be: SQ, 8% to 10%; LQ, 5% to 8%; international, 5% to 8%; and recall and returns revenues between $105 million and $120 million. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow between $353 million to $357 million. CapEx is anticipated to be between $65 million to $70 million.", "In closing, we are very pleased with our Q4 and 2012 results and excited about the multiple growth opportunities for 2013 and beyond.", "Thank you for your time today. Kyle, you can now open the Q&A line.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels from William Blair.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Maybe, Frank, I'll start with a quick housekeeping for you. Does the extension or re-extension of the workers' opportunity tax credit have much of an impact on your thoughts for the effective tax rate for 2013?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "No, for '13, our guidance is to remain at about the 36% as a tax rate.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then you mentioned specifically the StrongPak initiative kind of being novel in driving growth and you talked a little bit about that on the prior calls. Can you give us a little bit more color? I'm curious if that is all route-based pickup or do you have any mail-back solutions there, given that the retailers are probably producing less medical waste?", "Richard T. Kogler", "It's actually a route-based pickup for retail. And just to kind of give you a flavor for it, we purchased a company some years ago. We're now past the pilot phase, and we're offering the service nationwide, which is why it's becoming a strong growth driver. To give you some idea, there's about 750,000 retail locations that we can access as customers in the U.S. We estimate the market opportunity here could be slightly over $1 billion.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "And is that mostly waste-related, more delivery of health care in a retail location, so things like flu vaccinations that the pharmacies are doing more, or mini-clinic-type services or is it a lot broader than that kind of outside of medical waste and in other waste areas?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, it's broader than that, Ryan. It would be items that maybe were mislabeled or returned, items that could have batteries as part of their offering. It could be a chemical. If you go into a lot of retail outlets, obviously, they sell a lot of cleaning chemicals, some of those are hazardous upon disposal, aerosols, just things of those nature. It's more of a lab packing and hazardous waste service. Obviously, we're leveraging that. Medical waste we're already picking up from some of these locations and some of the pharmaceutical waste we also get from those retail clinics that have pharmacies on-site.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk from Wedbush Securities.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "I would just want to focus on one area in particular and the multiple growth that you laid. You commented about '13 and '14. And on previous calls, you set us up for expectations on patient communication in particular. So maybe I'll throw it back to you as to what you want to elaborate on, but obviously that's an area of interest on our side and then also the StrongPak which you just talked about, which are things that you've talked about in the past. But what's helping the transition to services -- to get to multiple services? And are there any in particular that you want to call out? And then secondly, update us on the patient communication activity.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, let me talk about 2013 growth drivers first. I think from a regulatory front, obviously, on the LQ side, pharmaceutical waste continues to do well, compliance continues to drive sales in the hospital market in the U.S. And then as Rich mentioned in his commentary around StrongPak, we certainly have benefited from regulatory action and fines that have been levered against some retailers in some of the states in the U.S. So that's certainly 2 areas where we see growth not only now at the end of 2012, but we anticipate continued growth in 2013. I think on the question you had on patient communications, Al, we obviously did a lot of studying in 2012. We feel really -- we're very excited about the opportunity. We're moving forward with this service for both our SQ and LQ customers. In 2013, we'll continue to make investments in this business. And long term, we see opportunity for both growth through acquisitions and internal growth. And then obviously, the main growth drivers continue. SQ being Steri-Safe, clinical services on the international front and the Sharps Management Service on the LQ side of the business.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Right. Charlie, in terms of the acquisition internal growth on patient communication, are you at a point right now and based on the studies and your history of the way you guys have invested in markets and services, do you have enough platform today to then start the niche acquisitions or smaller acquisitions? Or is this something that could be forthcoming in a little bit more larger size than say a $3 million or $4 million type transaction?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. I think from a capability standpoint, we've done acquisitions obviously in 2011. And now, in 2012, that has given us a really good platform both on the SQ and the hospital, the LQ side of the business. So obviously, as we look at 2013, we'll look at this acquisition as a tuck-in strategy for the business going forward. So I think from a platform standpoint, we feel really good about the capabilities that we've built on the platforms we've acquired to this point. And now moving forward, we'll look to see if we can take some advantages from the synergies and deals going forward.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then finally, if I may, could you talk about on the acquisition front in the quarter the composition of those not by geography, but by service mix?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "I think the composition in this quarter was 20% SQ, 80% LQ. We had 10 deals, 5 were domestic, 5 were international. There was 1 in the patient communication field and 9 in the regulated waste.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Guys, jumping to StrongPak, I believe it was just mentioned that there are 750,000 retail locations that match the target market. I think you guys had said not too long ago you had at least 2,000. Are you open to giving us an update on how penetrated you are thus far?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "We don't get detail-specific to the SQ and quantities by sector.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And is that -- Frank, if you correct me, it's mostly done by chain, right? You nationally contract with a chain or is this more of a mom-and-pop situation on how you work with retailers?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Right now, Scott, it's been in the larger retailers, and we work by chain, not necessarily nationally. Some of these contracts are regionally based depending on the retailer and how they want to comply with the regulations. Obviously, some states are more stricter than other states from an enforcement standpoint. But don't necessarily think that because we have a chain, we have it nationally, it just -- it varies by customer.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Switching up a little bit. For recall, a relatively soft quarter versus your run rate. And I notice you kept the guidance intact, any comments on how that's trending into January and just things that are going to be driving that in 2013, good or bad, please?", "Richard T. Kogler", "I think if you followed recall, and I know you have with us for several years, you recognize that it is a lumpy business, and we look at it on an annual basis. That's how we give our guidance, and that's really how we sort of look at that business. What we have noticed is that this year, for example, and towards the end of last year, the number of recalls, just sheer number of customers we're dealing with keeps increasing. In some quarters, the size or dollar amount of each recall can vary. But we think overall it's a very positive trend that long term, the more customers that we kind of bring into the family, the more opportunity we're going to have. And right now, our guidance is between 105 and 120 for the year.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "And then lastly on LQ growth, quite robust in the quarter. You maintained the guidance for 2013, but you also alluded to it being strong as you enter 2013. And you mentioned compliance driven and touched upon it a bit, but could you take us a level deeper as to really what's behind it, what's behind this elevated growth and how long you believe it can persist?", "Richard T. Kogler", "Well, I think as Charlie kind of alluded to, it's the -- call it the original growth drivers. The fact that Bio Systems or Sharps Management continues to be very well accepted. And then things like pharmaceutical waste, which has been hot all last year, continues and then we're moving into other directions too. I think those who follow us, and I know you do, we're conservative people, but we're very pleased with the growth we're seeing in SQ and LQ.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Maybe you could comment a little bit about the margins. EBITDA margins started to come back up last quarter. They're up again sequentially by looks like 20 basis points this quarter. Could you talk about what changed? You were on a downward trajectory for about 1 year, 1.5 years. Last quarter, one of the comments you made was that patient communications started to be additive. Can you give us just more color on a sequential basis what's contributing to the margin expansion?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "I think in the quarter, the sequential is really the gross margin improvement. So from a gross margin point of view, we had about overall a 23 basis points uptick just in the operational side of the business. Acquisitions and foreign exchange were at 3 point bps [ph] drags, almost nothing. So I think a lot of the lift in the quarter was the continued gross margin improvement in the business, operational and then selling the services with the higher margins at higher rates. So I think that continues to contribute. In the past, the slight drag in some of the quarters is really acquisition-driven and a mix of bringing those acquisitions on top of our business.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "So you have done a significant amount of acquisitions during this quarter as well. Is the -- is it less of a drag because they are -- maybe with medical waste, so there is less -- that's additive right away when you bring it into your business?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "The average margins for the businesses that we bought this quarter were closer to company average.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then what was the litigation settlement for?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "The litigation settlement was first of all for the New York that was announced and there were 2 others relating to prior acquisitions on litigation on those that we settled with people.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And just to follow up a little bit more on the patient communications question. Is patient communications continuing to be additive to the gross margin? Or where does that stand in terms of a proven-out business model?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "As we've said in the past, the patient communication is improving nicely in gross margins. In total, it is about at a company average but coming up.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason Rogers from Great Lakes Review.", "Jason Rogers", "Looking at your other income, there's a slight amount of other income in the quarter versus an expense last year. I just wondered what was comprised of that?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes. As a result of the capital gains change rates, we had some notes with respect to sellers, that sellers wanted to accelerate at discounts that we took advantage of discounting those notes and that gave us about a $700,000 impact positive on that line.", "Jason Rogers", "Okay. And then looking at StrongPak, is there any potential there for a compliance type of program? Or is it just strictly medical -- I'm sorry, any other kind of waste pickup?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, I mean we continue to look. Obviously, we've done a good job of selling compliance services on the SQ business. We are now selling compliance in a lot of our international markets. I think at this point, retailers just want to make sure they comply with their consent orders. So their first preference is for us to handle their waste and get it out. But we certainly think between our services, Jason, and the retail for StrongPak, obviously, when retail is pulling and retrieving items on the recall side, but down the road, there could be a service offering tied more to a compliance-type, Steri-Safe-type offering. But right now, the focus, rightly so for retailers, is complying with these regulations.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Steinke from Barrington Research.", "Kevin M. Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Just wanted to follow up again on StrongPak here. Just wondering now that it's out of pilot stage, is there much more significant investment that needs to be made to continue to roll out that offering? And how much are you leveraging your existing infrastructure in terms of trucks and disposal facilities with that offering?", "Richard T. Kogler", "I think you just answered your first question. There's always investment that we make in all of our businesses, particularly the high growth ones. But we do have a good platform, it's not capital intensive. It's a route business, so as the business grows, you add trucks and labor and that sort of thing.", "Kevin M. Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And I noticed in the quarter that SG&A, including amortization as a percentage of revenue, just ticked up a little bit sequentially to 19%. Just wondering if given the top line coming in strong in the quarter, if you decided to perhaps accelerate some investments and also how you might see SG&A as a percent of revenue trending in 2013?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes. So for the fourth quarter, the acquisitions we closed on and the related amortization of some of those added about 30 bps to that, so from 18.8%, 30 bps up, and then the remaining part of the business, excluding the acquisitions and related amortization, was about 10 bps down, so it gets you to roughly 19%. For 2013, I think overall, it should be maybe modeled at approximately 19% and that again includes amortization.", "Charles A. Alutto", "And I think, Kevin, if you look at it, if we think there's great opportunity, we'll reallocate those resources and make the investments we need to make to take advantage of the market. We're always looking at that.", "Kevin M. Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And I don't know if you -- how much more detail you would want to get into, but I don't know if you could provide any more color on just the size and the nature of the patient communications acquisition that you made in the quarter. Did you add any new services or anything notable with that?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. We did make a acquisition, as Frank said, in the patient communication space. This was a market leader in the hospital patient communication business. It enhances our capabilities in patient communication. To give you a little feel for it, we are now able to offer physician referrals, scheduling and post discharge calls, so it really rounds out our service offering in the patient communication space. We had some hospital contracts, through some other acquisitions that we made. But this clearly is the market leader in this space. And this acquisition is a focus on the hospital market.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Erin Wilson from Merrill Lynch.", "Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Robert Willoughby sitting in for Erin Wilson. Frank and company, can you possibly give us any updates on developments overseas? What's worked well for you over the past couple of quarters? And what kind of changes or what should we focus on for 2013 as it relates to specific geographies or businesses gaining traction?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. I think we continue to look at the geographies to build route density, Robert, so that's acquisitions in the SQ space. Clinical services, which is the Steri-Safe offering, we continue to penetrate that in markets like the U.K., Canada and Portugal. We're looking to expand that into the Spanish market. And then I think because we've got a large chunk of business on the LQ side, we continue to look at improving gross margins in the international space as well. Looking at service [indiscernible] pickup waste at those hospitals. But I think it's going to be overall looking at acquisitions for route density and looking to expand some of the additional services like Sharps Management, like clinical services into both the European and Latin America regions.", "Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And any specific countries in mind? I know you're obviously big in the U.K. but where else is top 3 or 4 markets?", "Charles A. Alutto", "I think really we look at this in all the markets we're in. But if you look at size and opportunity, Spain, U.K. and Brazil are some of the larger markets that we're looking at right now. And then, we're always looking to expand in those geographies where we think there's good opportunity. Our focus continues to be in Northern Europe and in Latin America.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee from Barclays.", "Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I guess a couple of questions. First, the SQ and LQ both have been growing above the high end of the guidance for several quarters. And I understand you tend to be conservative, but is there anything in particular you'd point to that you expect to lead to deceleration other than tougher comps when you come up against these?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Well, nothing specific. I think it's just a range that we feel comfortable with. And no, there's nothing really specific that would drive that in any direction.", "Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And then on the cross-selling success you've referenced throughout 2012, how do the economics compare to -- of a customer that uses multiple services versus only a single one or if it's easier to talk about just amongst the different ones? Are there some that are better than the core regulated way, some that are worse -- how do we think about that?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "So if you look at a small customer, a base customer without Steri-Safe, may have margins in the mid- to high-50s; with Steri-Safe, that may double the revenue, and the entire margin may go mid- to high-60s. So that incremental revenue really improves the margins even further. With a large customer, a base med waste customer, margins may be in the mid- to low-20s. And any incremental services, like Sharps Management and the pharmaceutical waste, all increase that margin profile, and it can triple the revenue with that customer now.", "Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then there's probably some rounding involved, but I noticed LQ customer -- no, customer count didn't grow at all throughout 2012 despite some M&A. Is there -- have you been losing more -- and that's grown pretty nicely, pretty much every year I can see going back 10 years. So have you been culling some customers, losing some, or is it more something you point out rounding as being the reason for it?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "No, I think your math must be wrong. Maybe I'll look at that with you after the call, but we went from about 15,600 to about 16,500.", "Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, all right. And just one last one, you referenced the New York Attorney General overcharging settlement or at least that's what the release we saw said. Can you give us any color on this in terms of how much of the company is government. And if there are contracts elsewhere where you don't specifically have pricing in the contract and thus could have some exposure to something like this?", "Richard T. Kogler", "Sure. This was an investigation that targeted really a small number of our government customers in New York, about 650. The New York Attorney General obviously alleged that we didn't follow our contract terms. We disagreed with him, but we made the business decision that to avoid legal expense, we would settle. And it is all now settled and behind us. We really don't see anything else to it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Stewart Scharf from S&P Capital IQ.", "Stewart Scharf - S&P Equity Research", "Could you talk a little about the multiples for your acquisitions? And where were the acquisitions domestically?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Domestically, they were -- I don't have the specifically, but they were -- I don't -- I have to follow up with you there where geographically were. Internationally, 2 in Spain, 2 in the U.K. and 1 in Chile. Domestically, I know 1 was in Texas, but the other ones I can't remember. The multiple is anywhere from 4 to about a little over 9 on an NPV basis. A little bit at a higher end of the range on maybe one of those due to the strategic side of that acquisition, which really enhanced our capabilities, and the rest of those deals were really in the range of anywhere 4 to 6. And those again were multiples of EBITDA.", "Stewart Scharf - S&P Equity Research", "Okay. And then that's pretty much within range?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes, I think if you look for the year, we were totally in the range of 4 to 8 multiples, which has pretty historically been the same, so I think not really a change in how we do deals.", "Stewart Scharf - S&P Equity Research", "Okay. And then what's the pricing environment you're looking at like right now? Do you see it improving or competitive based on specific areas and markets?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "I think on the deals, we really don't see a change. The pricing in the market, overall, Europe and the U.S. on multiples. I mean, the competition remains the same but with historically, again, and that 5 to 8 multiple is very normal for us on the deals.", "Stewart Scharf - S&P Equity Research", "And in general pricing in the industry?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "No real change.", "Stewart Scharf - S&P Equity Research", "Pretty much the same.", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Frank, just want to come back to EBITDA margins again heading into '13, just thinking about your SG&A comments, it does sound like in the back half of '12, specifically in the fourth quarter, gross margin was a positive tailwind that dropped through to EBITDA. As you think about '13, should we be thinking about EBITDA margins that are flattish with 2012 trends or would you expect gross margin mix to be beneficial in '13?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "If you look overall, I think normally Q1 from a gross margin as comparison to Q4 has been normally been a little bit flat for us historically, and we anticipate the same again in '13. And then the remaining of the year, we're kind of holding that SG&A at that 19%, you should see a year-end-over-year-end of that 40 to 60 basis point improvement in the total business. And that presumes again no acquisitions and no changes in things like surcharges or foreign exchange rates.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, very helpful. And then, Frank, just given the small changes in the capital structure across the quarter, any sense of where interest expense should come out roughly for '13?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes, I think you do need to adjust for the picture of the private placement, so I think your interest expense is probably for the year somewhere going to be in the 54.5 to 55.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Perfect, very helpful. And just maybe one last strategic question for Charlie or Rich. As we think about the mix of acquisition backlog o U.S. to U.S., I mean I wonder if you can give us sort of any qualitative or quantitative color on how that mix has shifted or how you would expect that mix to shift perhaps in '13 or beyond?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, Dave, I don't think it really has changed much. I mean, we still have a lot of opportunities left in the U.S. We remain active in the international markets that we're in today, and we continue to look at new geographies. So we really haven't seen any changes to that mix in what's available. Obviously, the pipeline remains well over $100 million in opportunity.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And do you still think the emerging markets specifically remain less important to the company than some of the European markets or more developed markets outside the U.S. at least for the next couple of years?", "Charles A. Alutto", "I think for the next couple of years, our focus will be more in the markets like Europe and Latin America, but we continue to look at the emerging markets as an opportunity in the next 3 to 5 years. We're certainly watching it, and we'll see how that develops.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Manthey from Robert Baird.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "In the recall business, I know you can handle everything from food to RV parts, but is there any aspect of that business that requires additional technology or expertise or anything you could either develop internally or acquire or are you pretty much set there from a growth standpoint?", "Richard T. Kogler", "We're set.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then second, on the patient communications business, how scalable is that business? I'm wondering -- you mentioned the improved profitability there. Does the profitability in that segment move up and down as you grow and absorb capacity? And does that flex around or is it more automated or have a bigger fixed component where the -- once the profitability is set higher, it'll remain higher over time?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "I think you need to look at it incrementally so you improve from where you are. There's definitely, with technology and efficiencies and the tools that people use, room for improvement. And we have already have shown that to ourselves in 2012 during the year when we have started integrating some of the acquisitions, so this is where you continuously will look as an increase. You may get some business that again you acquire that start out lower and then you bring them up. So it presumes again on the same platform that you can grow and you can improve the profitability with acquisitions than being mix changes.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. But from an organic investment standpoint, there's not big chunks of costs that need to go in and be absorbed. It's fairly scalable over time, so if you flex your costs up with your revenues going up, the profitability should continue to move up and to the right?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes. And it is a business that overall is really a lower capital-intensive business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk from Wedbush Securities.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Charlie and Rich, maybe all the team I guess, on terms of -- just to clarify, first of all, StrongPak and lab pack, are those -- StrongPak is the brand name or trade name, or am I confusing the 2 here?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. I think -- well, the service offering is called StrongPak. It is like a lab pack-type service. So when we go to these retail outlets, Al, they could be co-mingling different types of waste into one container as they're holding it at their site. But as we're transporting it, per DOT regulations, we will separate those into different waste streams. And those familiar with the waste industry, sometimes that's called lab-packing that material. So it's just we're using that term, but it's called StrongPak. Our service offering is called StrongPak.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Got it, right. Okay. So how -- maybe appreciate and obviously there's a component here that's customer driven. But how far away from -- I'm just trying to understand strategically how big these types of businesses could be down the road? Because obviously we know the traditional market share that you have and the waste services on pharma, medical, et cetera, and then the LQ growth and SQ growth. But these ancillary and incremental services, is this geared towards more the medical pharma side or more industrial, nonpharma, nonmedical business?", "Charles A. Alutto", "This is more -- the StrongPak is more towards the retail setting. But if you look at opportunity, I mean, we think that opportunity -- it's early on, but we believe it's an opportunity sort of incrementally of greater than $1 billion just in the U.S. And it's really nonmedical waste type of opportunity.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Thanks, Kyle. Well thank you, everyone, for participating today. We look forward to speaking to everyone again in April. Take care, and have a good night.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

My name is Jay, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Stericycle First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ms. Laura Murphy, Vice President of Finance, please go ahead.", "Laura A. Murphy", "Welcome to Stericycle's Quarterly Conference Call.  Joining me on today's call will be Frank Ten Brink, CFO; Rich Kogler, COO; and Charlie Alutto, CEO.", "I will now read the Safe Harbor statement. Statements made by Stericycle in this conference call that are not strictly historical are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, and should be viewed with caution. Factors described in this company's Form 10-K, 10-Qs, as well as its other filings with the SEC, could affect the company's actual results and could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from expected results. The company makes no commitment to disclose any revisions to forward-looking statements or any facts, events or circumstances after this date that may bear upon forward-looking statements.", "I will now turn it over to Frank.", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Thank you, Laura.", "The results for the first quarter are as follows. Revenues were $513.8 million, up 11.7% from $460.1 million in Q1 of '12. And internal growth, excluding returns and recall revenues, was up 8.1%. Domestic revenues were $363.6 million, of which $341.1 million was domestic regulated waste and compliance services, and $22.5 million was recalls and returns.", "Domestic internal growth, excluding recalls and returns revenues, was up over 9%, consisting SQ of 10% and LQ of 8%. International revenues were $150.2 million. And internal growth adjusted for unfavorable exchange impact of $4.2 million was up 5.4%. Acquisitions contributed $37.1 million to the growth in the quarter.", "Gross profit was $232.1 million or 45.2% of revenues. SG&A expense, including amortization, was $97.7 million or 19% of revenues. Net interest expense was $13.4 million, and net income attributable to Stericycle was $74.6 million or $0.85 per share on an as reported basis, and $0.88 adjusted for acquisition and other nonrecurring expenses.", "Now the balance sheet. Our covenant debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.1 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $675 million. In the quarter, we repurchased 79,602 shares of common stock in the open market in an amount of $7.6 million, and we have authorization to purchase an additional $3.7 million. Our capital spend was $16.5 million and our DSO was 61 days. Q1 year-to-date, cash provided from operations was $98.2 million.", "And I will now turn it over to Rich.", "Richard T. Kogler", "Thanks, Frank.", "Worldwide, we continue to use our strong free cash flow to drive our growth through acquisitions. In the quarter, we closed 12 transactions, 11 international and 1 domestic. The international acquisitions consisted of 1 in Spain, 2 in Japan, 4 in the U.K., 1 in Canada, 1 in Romania, 1 in Portugal and 1 in Chile. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust, with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business.", "At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 544,000 accounts, of which approximately 527,000 were small, the remainder were large. The strong internal growth rates we experienced in this quarter resulted from more customers adopting our multiple services, which includes StrongPak, Steri-Safe, pharma waste and Sharps Management. Increased regulatory scrutiny and fines for noncompliance have driven customer demand for these regulated waste and compliance services.", "For example, U.S. EPAs, state EPAs and joint commission are more focused on pharma waste than the health care sector. This scrutiny creates customer demand for our pharma waste program.", "We're excited about our future growth because when customers adopt multiple services, this can more than double or triple customer revenues.", "In closing, we want to thank each member of our worldwide team for their strong performance and continued commitment to our customers and shareholders.", "Now I'll turn it over to Charlie.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Thanks, Rich.", "I would now like to provide insight on our current outlook for 2013. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements.", "Revenues from the 12 acquisitions were approximately $2.4 million in Q1, and annualized are approximately $20 million. Keep in mind, our 2013 guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration, acquisition-related and other nonrecurring expenses. We believe analysts' EPS estimates will be in the range of $3.66 to $3.69.", "We believe analysts' revenue estimates for 2013 will be in the range of $2.11 billion to $2.14 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange rates. We anticipate 2013 internal growth rates to be: SQ, 8% to 10%; LQ, 5% to 8%; international, 5% to 8%; and recall and returns revenues between $95 million to $110 million. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow between $353 million to $357 million.", "CapEx is anticipated to be between $65 million to $70 million.", "In closing, we are very pleased with our Q1 results and excited about the multiple growth opportunities for 2013 and beyond.", "Thank you for your time. We'll now answer any questions. Jay, you can open up the Q&A line.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Daniels with William Blair & Company.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Let me start on the M&A front. Obviously, a very strong quarter given the number of transactions, but the diversity also surprised me. Are you seeing more opportunities over in Europe and o U.S. markets given some of the financial struggles or is that just timing that a lot of these deals in different markets hit during the first quarter?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "No. Again, we do deals opportunistically, and I would say that maybe the tax law changes in the U.S. maybe accelerated some deals into Q4 of 2012. The pipeline continues to be very robust and that's both in the U.S. and international.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "And then any color on, I guess, overall, the deals, what portion of that was regulated medical waste, and then within that, the SQ versus LQ mix?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes. So they were all in the regulated waste side, and it was about 60% SQ and 40% LQ.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. Great. And then a couple other questions on the patient communications business. I know you did a fairly sizable inpatient acquisition in that space last quarter. And I'm curious, 1, how the integration has gone? And then #2, have you begun to see any cross-selling opportunities where you're able to go to systems that own larger physician practices and can offer a bundled service across a continuum of care?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. Just to educate everybody, Ryan, that large acquisition was Beryl Health Care in the fourth quarter of 2012. It expanded our capabilities in the patient communication space. For instance, physician referrals enhanced our scheduling ability and post discharge calls. They were the market leader on the LQ space. We're still integrating that. We're integrating the Beryl piece with that platform acquisition that we have done about 2 years ago with NotifyMD. We do think we've got a unique position in the marketplace, not only in offering services to the physicians that are affiliated or owned by hospitals, but in the hospital themselves, especially in the lines of businesses we added with the Beryl deal.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Got you. That's helpful color. And then one quick one and I'll hop off. Just I saw a recent news release about a relationship with Premier and the GPO. I'm curious if that's something that's been long-standing. I think you had some exclusive relationships with them in the past, at least with their ASCEND members. So any color there would be helpful, just to provide a little clarity.", "Richard T. Kogler", "Yes, the Premier dealer was nothing new. It was a renewal of the opportunity. They usually have multiple vendors on that contract. I think you probably saw that in the same press release. That really is a hunting license now that we've always had so there's really no change to the business with that recent re-award with Premier.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Could we speak a little bit to the geographies? I believe you said 2 in Japan, and I think we've been quiet there for a while. Can you just talk to what you're seeing, the last question hit on Europe, but Japan specifically?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "We did 3 deals in Japan in '11. We did 1 deal in Japan in '12, and so this was a continuation. Really, in '12, they did a lot of work on integrating both the transportation and the treatment sites that we acquired there, and that allowed them to now continue to do acquisitions on top of that.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. The recall guidance, I think now for the year is adjusted a little bit lower than what you had been saying on the fourth call -- fourth quarter call. Could you just kind of frame that for us and confirm that's accurate? And then I have a follow-up.", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes. So the guidance last time was $105 million to $120 million, now $95 million to $110 million. With the shortfall in Q1 being about $7 million to $8 million. Yes, that's exactly the difference roughly and the total that we took the guidance down by.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. I know that one is tough to predict. Is there anything that you see building or I guess the guidance implies that kind of status quo from here. So moving on from that one. The last thing I wanted to touch upon is the organic growth was quite solid. Could you touch on premium offerings? How are things going on the premium area?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. I think as Rich said, Scott, the premium offerings are StrongPak. We continue to be on track on that. The customer uptake on that continues to be strong. Rx Waste and Sharps Management continue to be drivers on the LQ side of the business. And then Steri-Safe on the SQ side of the business, with a little bit of StrongPak as well moving that forward and we continue to see good growth rates there, so it's a good start to the year.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "And I'm sorry, Charles, you guys might have said it, I might have missed it. I know you mentioned last time what the contribution was of StrongPak specifically to the quarter. Have you touched upon that and would you?", "Charles A. Alutto", "No, we did not break that out last time.", "Operator", "Then next question comes from Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Just actually a quick question or 1-part question. Could you talk about with this focus on regulation and pharma waste demand, how we should think about the adoption rates of that service or market opportunity? And if there is a, I don't know if a so-called size of that market, just help us with that.", "Richard T. Kogler", "Yes. I think as we said before, we look at it as about a $200 million-plus market opportunity in the LQ space. Adoption rates, as you can tell from our LQ growth rates overall, have been pretty strong. And they are being driven by enforcement and compliance, both at the federal and the state level.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Is this something your sales force can reach into clients to help them take on this service, or is this one where you have to be somewhat have them come forth to you?", "Charles A. Alutto", "No. They usually come to us. I mean, they're getting a lot of scrutiny right now, not only from EPA, both on the state and the federal level, but joint commission now as they go into the reviews for the accreditation, look at it. Obviously, our salespeople are talking to our customers. We've got very good relationships on our LQ accounts, so we talk to them about this service offering and then it's their decision to make whether or not they try to do something in-house themselves on the characterization or have us do a full-service Rx Waste program within the hospital. We are seeing good adoption at the IDN level as hospitals now are large entities where they're making the decision for all the hospitals, we do see some uptick in some of the larger IDNs taking the program on.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just one, within the relative range of product offerings, how does this one fit margin profile-wise?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "I think the margins for this one are in the high 20s, low 30s, the gross margins.", "Operator", "Next, we have Michael Hoffman with Wunderlich Securities.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "On the organic growth, can we talk in the U.S., can you help us understand the proportioning of that total growth between your auxiliary services versus pricing coming in on the sort of the base legacy businesses?", "Richard T. Kogler", "Well, I think, as we've said before, on the base legacy businesses, if I'm understanding your question right, price is usually around CPI plus or minus depending on the customer type, and then the rest of it is organic growth.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "And that's -- that remaining organic growth is predominantly the auxiliary services, that's what I was really trying to understand?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, so, Michael, on the SQ, it's StrongPak and it is Steri-Safe. Volume does have a little bit on the SQ side. And then on the LQ side, it's mostly Sharps Management, Rx Waste, and, again, a little bit of StrongPak in there. Is that helpful?", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. Yes, that's helpful. And then, I get it, it's on a pending lawsuit but can you just talk a little bit about what this group is trying to accomplish? Do you have any sort of commentary about the lawsuit that was filed?", "Richard T. Kogler", "If you're referring to the class action lawsuit?", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Yes, from the veterinary group?", "Richard T. Kogler", "Yes, that was filed in Pennsylvanian on March 12, 2013, we've disclosed that on our 8-K. It seems to me to be, and to our attorneys to be simply a follow-on from the settlement we reached with the New York Attorney General. And also a 2008 whistleblower lawsuit that's been out there some time. Since that time, we've been served with 3 similar class action lawsuits that all have basically the same allegations; this is not unexpected. Our attorneys tell us that most of these cases end up being consolidated and tried as one; that's what we expect. As we said, we think the lawsuits are without merit, we'll defend ourselves vigorously. Beyond that, it's really inappropriate to comment because this is a pending litigation.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Fair enough. I just wanted to understand if there's any other sort of aspects of it. And then on -- can you comment on customer churns, particularly in the domestic business, U.S. business, and even more finally on small generator side, sort of given where we are sort of in this economic cycle, how would you frame the customer churn in the small generator market?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Really, we don't see a major difference in churn. I mean, we have a very good revenue retention, about 95%. And the raise of 5% leaves us some customers don't pay their bills, obviously, we stop service, there's doctors, dentists and the like that, close their shops and retire, some consolidate, that's a couple of percent, and then you're normal revenue may be 1% to 2%. It's -- obviously, it's a competitive market and we lose some to competition.", "Operator", "Next, you have a question from Erin Wilson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Erin  E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "On patient communications, I guess we keep hearing about progress there. Would you say this is moving ahead of expectations at this point and what percent of your targeted customer base is already on board? I assume it's still small, but -- and has maybe that addressable market changed at all in your view as far as who can actually benefit from this?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes, Erin, I would say it is meeting our expectations, so it's on track. Obviously, we're new into this so this is one with a great upside for us, with respect to a target. The only thing that's changed on the market opportunity side is obviously with the acquisition of Beryl, that increased our capability and, hence, increased the market size. Before Beryl, we're looking at $1 billion-plus opportunity, and now it's greater than $2 billion.", "Erin  E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Right. Okay. And then in Spain, I saw that you did another acquisition there and it seems like you're building out to some sort of critical mass. Are you beginning to roll out any sort of ancillary services there? And is the, I guess, customer base still primarily LQ? How much in the way of SQ is in that particular region?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes, we're still building the SQ business. Obviously, all the follow-on deals we did besides the 1 large deal in 2011, we've done now 10 addition deals in Spain, mostly smaller deals, so we're starting to build the SQ customer base. We are, as we said last time, we were starting to pilot the clinical service offerings for those -- to remind those again that's the Steri-Safe equivalent in the international market we're in now starting to roll out Steri-Safe in Spain, since we now have a good base of SQ customers. We still have some ways to go there, but we like the opportunity in Spain, and we're starting to launch the clinical services in that region.", "Erin  E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So where -- what regions now, as of now, do you have some sort of rollout ancillary service offering?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes. If you look at clinical services, we're in Canada, the U.K., Ireland, Spain and Portugal. And from a Sharps Management perspective, we're in Canada, Ireland, and we, at the end of last year, just finished our first Sharps Management plant in the U.K.", "Operator", "Next, we have Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Last quarter, you guys highlighted StrongPak a little bit more. Is there any change in their trajectory of their business or is it just you guys have already alerted us to that and, therefore, you haven't focused on it as much in your prepared comments?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. I know, that's exactly, Shlomo. We spoke about it last time. It remains on track. I think, the market opportunity, we spoke about last time, is $1 billion opportunity. I think the important thing to stress, these are multi-year agreements with many locations and they're reoccurring revenue stream. Customer interest remains very high and we're on track with our plans. So everything is moving along. Don't read anything into the comments about it. Everything is on track with respect to that offering.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then where are you guys in the platform build for the communications business? You've done a bunch of different acquisitions and I know others have big investment in the platform, where are you in terms of having kind of a unified platform that you want to be able to go out with?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. I think we're -- on the platform, with respect to the service capabilities, we feel very comfortable where we are now. There might be a few additional capabilities we will look out in the next year or so. From a systems platform, we're making progress. We like the -- we like what we've seen so far on some of the integration that we've done, we've got some work to do in that area. We've also seen some nice gross margin lift in that business on some the low-hanging fruit as we've started to integrate some of these businesses.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, Frank, your DSO ticked up a tad in the first quarter, does that have anything to do with more of the acquisitions in Spain?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "The DSO was up to 61. And there's really 2 factors there. It was a weekend cutoff. We also had Easter right before that, so there was some bank holidays in some of the European and Latin American countries. That was really the main driver of -- we feel the increase.", "Operator", "Next, we have a question from Gary Bisbee with Barclays.", "Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I guess, the first question, the guidance for organic growth for the SQ and LQ unit continue to be trending at the high end of those. Does that remain conservatism or is there anything we might look for that could lead to some slowing in those growth rates as we move through the year?", "Charles A. Alutto", "No. I think, with guidance, we're always conservative in guidance. Obviously, there's a lot of changes going on in healthcare right now, so I think it's prudent to be conservative with our growth rates. Growth rates, obviously, vary quarter-to-quarter based on the days in the quarter, influx of large contracts and holidays. But I think we are consistent to where we've been in the past, which is conservative.", "Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And then looking at the international business, I realize it's early in the adding on of ancillaries, but can you give us any sense just what, if you look at international as a total portfolio, what would the penetration of those be, either as a percent of revenue or just directionally relative to what it is in the domestic market? I guess what I'm getting at is how early in the game are we -- and maybe the follow-on to that is just how material could that be over, say, 5 years or something like that in terms of providing some gross margin lift?", "Charles A. Alutto", "I think, we're very early in the stages on the international front. And then I told individuals, I've been in Stericycle for many years, international business, to me, looks like Stericycle did in the late '90s, so we've got a ways to go on the opportunity. We do think we can double or triple the revenue over a long period of time. We think we can move gross margins. Every market will be different. Healthcare is different in every region and geography that we're in. But obviously, we feel really good about the international business over the long run.", "Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And then just one last one. In terms of the follow-on -- following up on the patient communications question, when will you be at the point in terms of the offerings and everything that you'll start to really ramp the strategy for upselling this to existing customers, and sort of how do you go about doing that?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, as I've said before, I think from a patient communications standpoint, 2013 will be a year we continue to make investments and look at acquisitions. I think the internal growth and the go-to-market will be finalized this year and you'll see it in 2014 and beyond.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "First off, on M&A, just wondering, you mentioned the 11 deals you did x U.S., are all those -- is it fair to say that all those are margin-dilutive to the core franchise in the near-term? I'm just trying to understand or see if we can quantify a little bit of how we should look at the margin impact from those deals over the next few quarters.", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes, normally, acquisitions have in the past been slightly margin-dilutive, depending, obviously, on the size of what they're coming in out of the quarter. And so this quarter, too, those deals that we did, since a lot of them are international, too, slightly margin-dilutive. You also have a factor maybe that you need to think about for the rest of the year. Obviously, foreign exchange rates are different right now than they were when we gave guidance the last time. And so FX impact in the remainder of the year is probably $8 million to $9 million unfavorable from a revenue point of view. So that is one to take into account to.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then maybe a second one on M&A. If you just maybe look at your funnel from here on potential pipeline deals, can you maybe give us a sense of how the U.S. versus x U.S. pipeline looks? Is it fair to say we're going to keep seeing a vast majority of your deal flow x U.S.?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "No. Again, we do deals opportunistically. We don't have a specific number for the U.S. or international, and the pipeline is robust in both areas. So I would never read into one quarter what a trend is. It's robust on both sides.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then just last one for me. On PCS, a little bit more of a big picture question with regards to the healthcare system in the U S. We've seen a pretty steady consolidation of individual physician practices into larger group practices over the last few years. And I'm just wondering if you have any examples you could share or point to where that market dynamic has driven, maybe accelerated adoption of PCS, just given that you already had, in some cases, relationships on waste management, and I was just wondering if that's been a fruitful way in which you can sort of upsell as the physician market consolidates?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. Overall, we're thinking the consolidation is going to be a positive for Stericycle. We think there will be an opportunity to consolidate vendors to like to Stericycle. We have seen 1 large system that actually went to Stericycle for all their physician-owned after hour answering services so that was a nice win for the team. I think the other thing I have to do though, as the systems get larger and they consolidate, it could slow up a little bit on the sales cycle. So it's plus or minus, but overall we think there will be consolidation to our vendors. We think Beryl will be a great opportunity for leveraging a relationship that they have at hospitals already. But we've already seen one nice win from the team on an after hour answering service that was affiliated with a very large IDN.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Kevin Steinke with Barrington Research.", "Kevin M. Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "I just want to follow-up on the pharma waste opportunity. Now that you see regulatory scrutiny picking up in that area, do you see that your pharma waste offering being able to perhaps start to gain some traction on the SQ side as well? Or are you going to continue to focus on the LQ for the foreseeable future?", "Richard T. Kogler", "We're focusing primarily on LQ because it's a $200 million-plus opportunity. Though certainly, the potential exists to move this into SQ and we're always experimenting with different offerings and tweaking our offerings, so maybe keep an eye on this space.", "Kevin M. Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And where are you now in terms of the SQ-LQ mix in the U.K. specifically? And then how does that compare to the rest of your international markets?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes. U.K. has right now approached the mid-30s from a revenue point of view that's SQ-related. Again, we don't disclose the fee [ph] to the countries but each country continues to focus on that. Obviously, as Charlie said, like the Sharps Management now going overseas in these countries, also will give a nice lift for the LQ side.", "Kevin M. Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And Frank, just on the gross margin up 10 basis points sequentially, can you give us any puts and takes there, as well as energy as a percent of revenue in the quarter?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", ";", "Yes. The energy as a percent was 5.6%, same as last quarter. If you kind break down the gross margin, acquisitions was at like a 5 bp, basis points, reducer; foreign exchange, offset that a little bit with 4 bps up; and then the business itself, the remainder was 12 bps up.", "Kevin M. Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And for the full year, should we continue to expect in that range of a 40 to 60 basis points of gross margin improvement that you mentioned last quarter?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes, consistent with what we've done in the past, 40 to 60 basis points, yearend over yearend.", "Operator", "Next, we have Richard Close with Avondale Partners.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "With respect to the BerylHealth, if we could go into that a little bit more. It seems like they have some -- rather than just the patient communications aspects, they have some analytics and different technology platforms. And I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit in and around the margin opportunity there, in terms of what type of gross margins do they have compared to maybe some of the other add-on businesses, such as Steri-Safe and the Sharps Management and some of those other add-ons?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. So Richard, it's not a technology platform. I've seen it out there, Beryl is a call center type of business. Now they do have data analytics where they take some of the information on some of their physician referrals and feed that back to the hospital and help them with their marketing strategy and that they're putting their marketing dollars in the right place. So they do have some data analytics that go along with their service offering but it's not a technology. When we look at the business itself from Beryl and compare it to other patient communications, the gross margins are very similar and EBIT margins are very similar, which is, right now, close to our corporate margins, but obviously, the EBIT margins are a lot lower since we've got a SG&A spend to it.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then with respect to the acquisitions that have been put in place that are completed in the most recent quarter, I think you said $20 million in annualized revenue contribution. That seems maybe a little bit lower amount than some of the most recent quarters, although I know that number bounces around. Can you talk a little bit about that in terms of the size of the acquisitions? Are you seeing anything different? I know you reaffirmed your $100 million in annualized pipeline, but if you'd talk a little bit about the size of the acquisitions?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes. I wouldn't read anything into that. Again, as I said, the tax law changes in the U.S., that kind of accelerated some deals into Q4. Pipeline, as we said, is robust, both U.S. and international, there's again definitely north of $100 million in that pipeline. So no, I would not read anything into this quarter. It's not uncommon for us that Q1 is a little bit slower for the last almost 2 to 3 years, we've had the scare that tax rates would go up, and as a result, people did deals in Q4.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "And final question for me. Is there any opportunity near-term? Do you see patient communications on the international front at all?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Right now, I mean, long-term, we think there are some opportunities, but right now, the focus is on patient communications in the U.S. business. We do think from a call center standpoint, the recall and returns business could do some things internationally. But right now, on the patient communication, that business is going to be mostly U.S. And I think the reason we're focusing on that is, as you know, with the changes in the healthcare law and the Affordable Care Act, patient satisfaction is important to the long-term reimbursement rates for hospitals, so there is a lot of focus right now around the patient experience, and part of that is how hospitals and healthcare providers communicate with their patients.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Stewart Scharf with S&P Capital IQ.", "Stewart Scharf - S&P Equity Research", "Basically, most of my questions have been answered. Just what would you -- where would you focus on in Europe? Is there any area of concern or is it -- are you just looking opportunistically, as you said, or is there any specific area in Europe that is worse than other areas of your business?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "No. I think there's opportunities. Definitely, in Spain, with the number of transactions we have done, there is opportunity for integration and improvement in the margins there. In the U.K., there's some -- obviously, with them now being in newer products like Sharps Management and clinical services, there is room for growth there, in the same time, there's bits obviously, all the time going, that they've done a very good job at. And Portugal, not dissimilar to Spain, good opportunities for integration still. No, we see opportunities here. We don't see specific issues that head us right now. It looks like from a pricing point of view, that we've had some contracts that were CPI kind of related, that seems to have bottomed out a little bit, too.", "Charles A. Alutto", "And I think, Steward, if you're asking about new geographies in Europe or -- we continue to look at new countries, not only in Europe, but Latin America and Asia for expansion as well. And when those opportunities become available to us, we'll look at them and potentially do deals in those new geographies as well.", "Stewart Scharf - S&P Equity Research", "Okay. And do you have the number of shares bought back again, I didn't catch that.", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "The number of shares repurchased?", "Stewart Scharf - S&P Equity Research", "Yes.", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "That was, hang on one second, we had 79,602.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Sean Dodge with Jefferies.", "Sean Dodge - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Charlie, just kind of following up on your last comment. Can you give us some sense of how you guys think about or prioritize entering new international markets versus back-dealing existing ones? And maybe what I'm kind of trying to get at here is that over the next couple of years, is there going to be more focus on building out your existing footprint or are the majority of your resources going to be placed toward identifying and entering these new geographies?", "Charles A. Alutto", "No, I think we always have balanced both. We look at it where are the opportunities, we kind of know which countries we want to look at to expand into. Obviously, we look at countries we're in first, that's where a lot of the M&A spend their time because we do get the synergistic value of those deals when we close them. When we're looking at a new country, though, we look at Tier 1 counties, obviously, there needs to be a base around regulated waste regulations for us to even think about that market. We look at the stability of the country and the currency. And then also look at the management team. If it's our first entry into a new market, we want to be able to grow with that management team and do all their deals. So there's a lot of factors that go in there, but certainly, we need a base  regulations there, and a good health care market and those are some of the things that go into the decision-making process.", "Sean Dodge - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. And then on the sales force in general, are there any planned changes to the size or structure of the sales force or your marketing spend for that matter, now that you're trying to ramp into less traditional services lines like patient communications and StrongPak?", "Richard T. Kogler", "Well, I think, we've done a pretty good job. Those who have followed us. And seeing how we kind of use the existing force sort of cross-sell and sell multiple services. We're certainly SG&A-conscious. And I think, at this point, what you have seen occasionally is our SG&A as a percent of revenue will move up a little bit if we've got a hot hand to feed. And then once we've sort of gotten the sales force used to that, we put those dollars somewhere else or move them back into the pot. So I don't think you're going to see anything dramatic with spend, and right now, I think the growth rates reflect that the sales team is doing a great job.", "Operator", "The next question comes from David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "A question for you on the non-GAAP presentation and the guidance. Historically, it's been Stericycle's practice not to exclude integration expenses and I see that you're adding them back this quarter. I'm just wondering if you can talk about that? And then when you gave the guidance of $365 million to $369 million for this year, were you assuming a level of integration expenses in that or not?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes, if you go back to the script of last quarter, we said that in our prior guidance, we would adjust for it. We think it's better comparability, it gives more clarity and transparency to shareholders. So also kind of it matches how we run the business and how we review people. So we, as a result of that, made that change, and said so in the last quarter, and the guidance.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Right. So non-GAAP presentation for starting first quarter of this year, you're excluding not only acquisition-related expenses but integration-related expenses routinely going forward?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. And we do it for both, obviously, this year and last year. So last year, we'll adjust up from that point, the comparable is $3.34 from an EPS point of view.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then, second, Frank, on the tax rate, still 36%?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes, that's good for guidance.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Yes. And then finally, within these newer areas you're getting into, the patient communications, the Rx Waste, StrongPak, primarily, the last 2 kind of the waste-type services offering, have you seen any change in the competitive landscape at all? It would seemed like when you get these large, potentially rapidly growing regulatory change-type markets, that you'd have some rush of entrants into those markets. Can you talk about the competitive landscape and how you expect to deal with that going forward?", "Richard T. Kogler", "Yes. I think on the regulated waste side, Dave, obviously, we see lot of competition for both the Rx Waste and the StrongPak business, both in a local and a regional level. I think, for both offerings, though, we're in a unique position given our relationship, not only in the health care side but on the retail as well. And I think our core competencies fit well in both Rx Waste and StrongPak and that's what makes us successful in selling in this space.", "Operator", "The next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.", "James Francescone - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "This is actually James in for David. I think, just 1 question on international. Even as domestic SQ and LQ growth have been consistently hitting the high end of the range in those businesses, international has been a little bit of a laggard, and obviously, there are some fundamental reasons for that, business mix and things like that. But could you help us understand here, how much going forward, how much of the priority in the international business has increased the organic growth rate versus getting growth through M&A versus profitability? And how does that develop going forward?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "I think we were very pleased to see the international ones start to come up a little bit. Again, the team is doing a good job. Obviously, the last year, 1.5 years, European escalators have slowed that growth a little bit and 1 or 2 of those geographies affected was, for some quarters, negative. So now, having bottomed out on that, it comes up a little bit. And I think we're pleased that it's starting to come up a little bit and the team is doing a good job.", "Operator", "Next, we have Barbara Noverini with Morningstar.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "I think you might have touched upon this briefly before but just for clarification's sake, how should we think about StrongPark service offerings, is this more an event-driven business like RRM or is this more of a recurring program that you're offering customers where you're billing them on a regular basis?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. This is not like RMS. This is not project-driven. This is a recurring revenue stream, they are multiyear agreements with many locations with recurring revenue, so very similar, identical to our core regulated waste offerings.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And are there different tiers of services within these programs?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Not like Steri-Safe, if that's the question, because they're like a standard select and preferred. Obviously, every client has different needs. So the pickup schedules and the level of service we might give one customer might differ, but there aren't different levels of service like a Steri-Safe offering.", "Operator", "And your final question comes from Gary Bisbee with Barclays.", "Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just one quick numbers follow-up. Can you break down the $34.2 million, I think that was the year-to-year growth in organic revenue, across international versus U.S and within U.S., SQ and LQ?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "We do that in the Q, so you'd have to wait for that one at that time.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Thanks, Jay. In closing, I just want to remind everyone that today is Administrative Professional Day. Make sure you acknowledge those administrative professionals that contribute to the success of your organization. On behalf of the Stericycle executive team, we want to thank Kelly, Rhonda and Sandy for all their hard work this past year.

Joining me on today's call will be Frank Ten Brink, CFO; Rich Kogler, COO; and Charlie Alutto, CEO.", "I will now read the Safe Harbor statement. Statements by Stericycle in this conference call that are not strictly historical are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, and should be viewed with caution. Factors described in the company's Form 10-K, 10-Q, as well as its other filings with the SEC, could affect the company's actual results and could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from expected results. The company makes no commitment to disclose any revisions to forward-looking statements or any facts, events or circumstances after this date that may vary upon forward-looking statements.", "I will now turn it over to Frank.", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Thanks, Laura. The results for the second quarter are as follows. Revenues were $526.5 million, up 12.3% from $468.9 million in the second quarter of 2012. And internal growth, excluding returns and recall revenues, was up 7.5%. Domestic revenues were at $370.2 million, of which, $346.5 million was domestic regulated waste and compliance services, and $23.7 million was recalls and returns. Domestic internal growth, excluding recalls and returns revenue, was up 7%, consisting of SQ of 8% and LQ of 6%.", "International revenues were $156.3 million, and internal growth adjusted for unfavorable exchange impact of $4.1 million was up approximately 9%. Acquisitions contributed $34.1 million to the growth in the quarter.", "The gross profit was $237.9 million or 45.2% of revenues. And SG&A expense, including amortization, was $100.6 million or 19.1% of revenues. Net interest expense was $12.9 million, and net income attributable to Stericycle was $78 million or $0.89 per share on an as-reported basis, and $0.93 adjusted for acquisition and other non-recurring expenses.", "Now the balance sheet. Our covenant debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.1 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $644 million. In the quarter, we repurchased 540,390 shares of common stock on the open market in an amount of $59 million, and we have authorization to purchase an additional 3.2 million shares. Our capital spend was $20.9 million and our DSO was 63 days. Q2 year-to-date cash provided from operations was $176.5 million.", "And I will now turn it over to Rich.", "Richard T. Kogler", "Thanks, Frank. Worldwide, we continue to use our strong free cash flow to drive our growth through acquisitions. In the quarter, we closed 12 transactions, 8 international and 4 domestic. International acquisitions consisted of 1 in Japan, 3 in the U.K., 1 in Romania, 1 in Portugal, and 2 in Brazil. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business.", "At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 550,000 accounts, of which, approximately 532,000 were small, the remainder were large. The strong domestic internal growth rates we experienced in this quarter resulted from more customers implementing our multiple services such as StrongPak, Steri-Safe, Pharma Waste and Sharps Management. International internal growth rates accelerated due to an increasing customer adoption of multiple services and expansion into new lines of business. Worldwide, we see increased regulatory requirements driving customer demand for our regulated waste and compliance offerings. And as we expand in new services such as communications solutions, we provide additional value to our customers. This strengthens our customer relationships, provides us with multiple new long-term growth opportunities. We remain excited about our future growth because when customers adopt multiple services, this can more than double or triple their revenues.", "In closing, we want to take time to thank each member of our worldwide team for their strong performance and continued commitment to our customers, our shareholders and our values.", "I'll now turn it over to Charlie", "Charles A. Alutto", "Thanks, Rich. I would now like to provide insight on our current outlook for 2013. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements.", "Revenues from the 12 acquisitions were approximately $1.6 million in Q2 and annualized are approximately $38 million. Keep in mind, our 2013 guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration, acquisition-related and other non-recurring expenses. We believe analysts' EPS estimates will be in the range of $3.69 to $3.71. We believe analysts' revenue estimates for 2013 will be in the range of $2.12 billion to $2.15 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange rates.", "We anticipate 2013 internal growth rates to be: SQ, 8% to 10%; LQ, 5% to 8%; international, 5% to 8%; and recall and returns revenues between $95 million to $105 million. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow between $353 million to $357 million. CapEx is anticipated to be between $67 million to $70 million.", "In closing, we are very pleased with our Q2 results and excited about the multiple growth opportunities for 2013 and beyond. Thank you for your time today, and we'll now answer any questions. Tracy, please open the Q&A line.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Ryan Daniels with William Blair.", "Unknown Analyst", "This is Nick in for Ryan. I was just wondering, do you feel that you have a fairly complete platform built out for patient communications now, or do you think you'll be doing any more decent-sized deals in that space during the second half or is the focus now going to be more on go-to-market and driving organic growth?", "Charles A. Alutto", "I think, from a platform perspective and the services that we offer, we have a fairly complete service offering. We'll continue to make investments in infrastructure and platform in 2013. Long-term, we see a great opportunity to grow this business and we're encouraged because we are seeing hospitals outsourcing some of their communications services.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay. Great. And it looks like you're branding some of the communications assets now as a Stericycle communications solutions company. I'm just curious if you could discuss your go-to-market strategy in that space and if you found that leveraging the Stericycle brand in tandem with the existing operator brand is driving more market awareness of services or helping drive a higher win rate?", "Charles A. Alutto", "That's a good question. I think, from a go-to-market strategy, we still are using the Beryl name, but we are introducing the Stericycle name under the communications solutions umbrella. We're receiving really good feedback from our customers. They've been very positive about Stericycle becoming a leader in this space.", "Unknown Analyst", "And just one quick housekeeping question. On the acquisitions this quarter, could you give any breakout between SQ and LQ or what business lines those were in?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes, so it was 35% SQ and 65% LQ revenues, and 11 of the acquisitions were in regulated waste, and 1 was in the kind of recalls and returns area.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Bill (sic) [Al] Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "I guess they changed my name from Al to Bill. Just on the acquisition there on the recall, returns, Frank, is that geared geography-wise or another service opportunity or another type of recall?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "No, that was a geographic expansion. It was an international one and is expanding our capabilities internationally into recalls and returns.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "And that's one of the -- in terms of international though, is this your initial acquisition internationally on the returns, recalls business or?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. We've had some recalls in the past where we've done some international capabilities where we've subcontracted some of that work. This acquisition created an opportunity for us to build infrastructure, specifically in the European marketplace.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "And that would, I think, suggest that there's some opportunities to, a, grab some share and there's some growth in that type of business?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Absolutely.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, just one other item I wanted to try and address here, Charlie. On the margins, looks like you're getting some good pull-through on some of the developments of some of the new initiatives. I was wondering if you could just maybe give us an update on how you feel where you're at? I know there's a lot of work to be done, but just in terms of the overall contribution to gross margin as you move out and where you're at in the expansion of this service?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, I'll let Frank bridge a little bit on the quarter-to-quarter margin. But I think, the opportunity for margin expansion hasn't changed. We continue to look, long-term, to increasing our gross margins in the international markets. That will come by focusing on the SQ business, adding additional services like Clinical Services and Sharps Management. And in the U.S. side of the business where we did see relatively nice uptick in margins in Q2, again, the focus is on those additional services that do have higher incremental gross margins than our base business. Frank can maybe walk you through the puts and takes for the quarter with respect to the margin Q1 versus Q2.", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Acquisitions were just a slight drag, only 4 basis points. Foreign exchange kind of offset that. Because international grew a little bit faster than historically, that, because of margins in general being a little bit less there, brought margins, in effect, down, but the general business has a nice uptick, somewhere between 11 and 15 basis points quarter-over-quarter.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "And then, just back to the more broader question. If hospitals are outsourcing a little more, should we think through that as eventually getting more scale on your operating leverage for that segment or is that going to be sort of consistent with your historical trends on performance there?", "Charles A. Alutto", "I think, we'll be consistent, I mean, our operating leverage on the communications solutions business will come from building out our infrastructure, getting on a common platform and being more productive with respect to the centers that we're running today, Al. Anytime you can add more activity to the center, obviously, you'll get some lift as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sean Dodge with Jefferies.", "Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "So you guys have talked in the past that Japan is about the second-largest med waste generator in the world. And I'm curious, so the weakness we've seen in the yen over the last few quarters, how big of a role is that playing in your acquisition strategy there, and does this maybe help you guys accelerate your move down to the central and southern parts of that country?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Most acquisitions aren't as much driven by foreign exchange. And so the timing of them isn't driven by the dollar or the yen or any other currencies getting stronger. And obviously, if the yen goes a little weaker, the deals may get a little cheaper in dollar terms, but then obviously, it also has a relative slightly less consolidated result [ph] on to our total returns. No, I don't think so. Japan continues to be a market where we see opportunity as a gradual increase, it's always a little tougher to do M&A in Japan, as we've said before. But there's good opportunity there and the group will continue to look for opportunities to buy businesses.", "Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. And then, outside of Japan, you guys really haven't done much in the other parts of Asia. Is there something structurally about those markets that are keeping you out of there or is it you just have your plate full with Europe and South America, and the other geographies that you just haven't had time for it yet?", "Charles A. Alutto", "No, Sean, we continue to look at markets around the world, Asia being one of them. Again, looking for -- there's a lot of factors that go into selecting the next geography, we certainly have some targets in Asia, but we're very patient and we want to make sure we do the right deal and the right terms and find the right management team. So we continue to look in Asia, and I think, over time, you will see an expansion into other markets in the Asian region.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Guys, could you clarify, did the high end of RMS guidance go down by $5 million? And if so, why? Because you had a good quarter and you mentioned this acquisition.", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "We did bring the top end down a little bit. The quarter itself was okay within our own guidance. We're starting to see some international revenues on that one, but overall, we're cautious for the second half. We haven't really had any major larger recalls. Again, the team did a fabulous job in that they managed a record quantity again this quarter in a number of events, and that's good, but we haven't had any blockbuster large recalls.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Got it. A little bit more housekeeping on the acquisitions. With regard to those international, could you give us a feel for SQ, LQ recall mix, please, Frank?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes, I think, total, the mix was 35%, 65%, and then it kind of crosses over. That's for the total that we normally give the information on for all the deals combined.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And so international is representative of the total as well?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes, it's probably similar, yes.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, no patient communication acquisitions in the quarter. I think, someone asked earlier on this, but it was my understanding that you guys would start to become aggressive with acquisitions once you had the infrastructure set up the way you like it, and felt that you can integrate well going forward. Is that still on pace? I know we touched on this a little earlier, but I was just curious to see in absence in the quarter?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, very much on track. Just to reeducate everybody again, we did a rather large acquisition of the Beryl Health business in Q4. We're integrating their team with our team, so I would tell you that everything is on track there, but again, the Beryl acquisition integration is one that we wanted to make sure that we were comfortable with before we move forward but everything is on track and we definitely will continue to look at this space. I wouldn't read anything into the fact that there were no patient communication deals this quarter.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And I don't want to ask too many but just on CapEx, free cash flow and CapEx outlook, pretty consistent with what you had said last time, but a big jump in the second quarter this year versus last year. Is that just a timing issue, I guess it is based on the guidance, but anything special going on there?", "Richard T. Kogler", "No, it's really just the timing of investment in plants in the U.S., in Latin America and Europe kind of simultaneously. All these projects had a good return for us. We're still going to manage to a CapEx number of about $67 million to $70 million for the year.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Michael Hoffman with investors group.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Wunderlich Securities. Can you help us a little bit about your thoughts on the trend as a percent of sales for the remainder of the year on your G&A and your D&A?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes, so in general, you've seen a slight uptick in the SG&A this quarter versus the prior. Some of that was kind of acquisition-related. A little bit of investment spend continuing on things like comm sol and the like, that obviously -- if you then include amortization where you've seen over the years more of an uptick coming in, so the 10 basis points is really a function of the acquisitions a little bit and then the overall for the year, we think the guidance is about 9.1%.", "Charles A. Alutto", "19.1%.", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "19.1%, sorry.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "19.1% for the whole year?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "For the year.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Well then, that calls for a really steep increase in the second half then.", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "No. So that's SG&A, stock options and it includes the amortization. That includes it.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Yes, I didn't have the amortization in it. Okay. And then, on your D&A?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "D&A, fairly stable. I mean, no major things there. It's really -- no, I don't see major swings there. Again, the A is where you'll see the move a little bit. Depreciation, very stable, 2.9%. It's in the amortization that it may be the 1.2%, 1.3% on a rounding.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, pretty big working capital swing in this quarter. How much of that is just timing, and you've already got it back but it was a pretty negative working capital swing?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes, most of it was receivables. And so on the receivables side, we have a lot of acquisitions that closed at the end of the quarter, so the receivables show on the books and that kind of changes the DSO paradigm a little bit because you don't have the revenues in the quarter. We had an increase a little bit in the U.K., the NHS has gone through a kind of restructuring on their payment systems and that delayed payments out of the NHS a little bit that are impacted. So the receivables is more a timing issue in the quarter. Both Q1 and Q2 were unfavorable cutoffs, they were Sundays, so that never helps on your collections. But we think, for the year, we'll get that back and that will become more in line.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And have we already seen some of that back in the third quarter?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, can you talk a little bit about sort of the nature of the activity in Steri-Safe, I remember, Charlie, when we met in New Orleans, you talked about what I call upselling going from a low-tier pricing to mid-tier to high-tier, can you just frame or characterize that in the second quarter and sort of the trend as it goes through the year? That and StrongPak?", "Charles A. Alutto", "I don't think there's -- and I'm sorry, Michael, what's the follow-up on that?", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Well, I mean, StrongPak is sort of a similar conversation about sort of how do you feel about where that rate of growth is, is it still trending up or has it hit a level and it's holding with -- how does that sort of?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, I think, Steri-Safe continues. It's a long opportunity for us. There hasn't been any material change in the percentage of growth attributed to Steri-Safe quarter-to-quarter. On the StrongPak, if you remember, when we sell it, it was a recurring revenue, but the contracts are it's a large contract that we implemented for both LQ and SQ. So the timing of those opportunities do fluctuate quarter to quarter, Michael.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And so how was the second quarter impacted by StrongPak?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, I think, if you look at growth rates from quarter-to-quarter, you'd see that it was a little lower in SQ in Q2, so we didn't have that large influx of a large StrongPak contract that was implemented in Q2. Nothing to read into that, we feel really -- we remain excited about the opportunity in StrongPak, we still think the market opportunity is over $1 billion. Again, we are leveraging our core competencies in transportation, compliance and routes.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, on the patient comms, one of the initiatives is to rationalize some of the call centers. Where are we in that?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Continued nice margin expansion in that sector. And so from that point, the team has done a very good job in the integration. If you look year-over-year, I mean, definitely percentage points of improvements and we see continued opportunity for improvement there.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "So what inning are we in, this initial rationalization of cost structure?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Second inning.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Second inning. Okay. And then, last. I just -- so I'm clear, maybe I misunderstood this, the international business tends to be more LQ. So would the acquisitions tend to be skewed differently than normal? I mean, usually, you're mostly LQ and a little bit of SQ?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes, I think, it's definitely...", "Charles A. Alutto", "It was 35% SQ and 65% LQ.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Great. So that was -- because your overall pool was -- didn't you say the overall pool was 65%?", "Charles A. Alutto", "No, 35% SQ. 65% LQ.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Erin Wilson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Can you talk a little bit about the potential opportunity associated with waste management's overall sort of deemphasis of the med waste business? And did that contribute anything meaningful in the quarter?", "Richard T. Kogler", "Well, I think, we've all seen the same media reports that they're reevaluating their health care business but what we see is they continue to compete with us in multiple geographies.", "Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. So could you speak, I guess, then, to the current pricing environment in the U.S.?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "There's really no change, I mean, in the market.", "Richard T. Kogler", "It's been -- this business has always been competitive as long as I've been in it, and I've been in it for over a decade. So it really doesn't change. And as I said, waste management continues to compete vigorously out there.", "Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then, you touched a little on this, but what were the key drivers for the international internal growth rate? Was there any particular ancillary service that received greater adoption or any other key drivers that you'd like to point out?", "Charles A. Alutto", "I think, some good color on the international growth there would be we do see the European escalators slowly improving. There has been an adoption of our rollout of additional service like Sharps Management and Clinical Services, and we did see some of the -- an increase in some of our international recall revenues in the quarter. And those all contributed to the really nice growth that we had in Q2 for international.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Just looking at the revenue guidance, the revenue guidance is up $10 million on each side. You added about $20 million, which should be additive through acquisitions. Is the difference $5 million because of recalls and then some kind of rounding or something, because I would have expected that the revenue guidance should be a little bit higher?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes. In fact, foreign exchange is the main contributor. So the previous guidance was $2.11 billion to $2.14 billion, and foreign exchange continues to be a little bit of a headwind, probably in the $7 million to $7.5 million over the second half. And then, the acquisitions in the remainder of the year are about $19 million. And so that gets you to your $2.12 billion to $2.15 billion.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And what kind of tax rate should we use? Tax rate has been wide [ph] for the last couple of quarters, what should we expect for the rest of the year?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "It's a little bit better in the overall outlook, so right now, it's in the high 35s.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, on the StrongPak business, can you talk about a little bit on any interesting developments that might have happened over the quarter, or competitively, where you guys think that you stack up vis-\u00e0-vis some of the larger players in that part of the industry?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Shlomo, we haven't seen any kind of changes on the competitive landscape. There are some larger privately owned companies that are national and they're offering this another player that actually is a publicly traded company that also participates but there really hasn't been a change in the competitive nature of the business. So the other question was related to regulatory. I think, the other thing is you have seen some media reports about some funds that were settled by retailers. I will tell you that those were finally [ph] settled, those companies already made a buying decision so it didn't impact in the quarter. But anytime we see those kind of reports, we like that, it validates what we're doing, it demonstrates to all the retailers that they do need to comply with these regulations. So I think those are some of the things that you saw in the quarters. For our business, we're on track with our plans. We still think there are over 750,000 retail locations in the U.S. that would require this type of service. And that equates to about $1 billion market opportunity.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, the last thing, the receivables trickling up, that is primarily what you talked about the U.K. NHS, and the acquisitions got nothing to do with anything like in Spain?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "No, Spain, in fact, is still nicely ahead of when we acquired it. As you know, we had an influx last year. It's gone up slightly but not as much and that's not -- has been a big influence on it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Steinke with Barrington Research.", "Kevin M. Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "I was just wondering if you could offer any commentary on the pharmaceutical waste offering and how that is playing out in the market for you currently?", "Richard T. Kogler", "Sure. I mean, it actually is being well-received, it has been for some time. It seems on plan with their goals. We still see a healthy pipeline of contract orders and installs. And as we said before, this as a $200-plus-million opportunity for us in just the domestic LQ space, so we have a lot of runway still to go.", "Kevin M. Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Do you see opportunity to roll that out internationally as well in the future?", "Richard T. Kogler", "I think, in certain markets, it may be applicable but one of the things about international is you have to look at the regulations and the health care regime in each country. So I think, right now, we're very busy in the United States and we will be for some time.", "Kevin M. Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And Frank, what was energy as a percentage of revenue in the quarter?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Energy and fuel was 5.5%, but always remember that account now is based on the services impacted by energy fuel only, not on total revenues.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Richard Close with Avondale Partners.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Just a follow-up on the international rebound there. Is that something we should expect to continue over the foreseeable future here or upcoming quarters at or above the high end of your targeted range and internal growth?", "Charles A. Alutto", "No, I think, I mean, we left guidance unchanged there, Richard, so we're assuming 5% to 8%. Obviously, we feel a lot better about it, that's why we left the guidance unchanged from the year before even though obviously we are in the 4% and 5% 2012 in the first part of this year. We're always conservative with our guidance, but we feel real comfortable with that 5% to 8% range, but certainly feel real -- the teams did a really good job in the international markets in the last quarter.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And continuation on the international, just to be clear, on the returns management acquisition there, that's going to show up on the returns line and not in the international line?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "No, I think, the segment reporting will require us to continue to book that under the international numbers and when it becomes material there, then we will break it out.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. I just want to talk a little bit about maybe what's in store in the next couple of years. Obviously, you have these higher margin or higher growth areas, the Sharps, the Steri-Safe and I guess pharmaceutical returns, things along those lines and patient communications, how do you guys go about determining areas to -- add-on, service areas to add-on, what do you think the opportunity is there? Obviously, I don't expect you to go into specifics to show your hand there, but how many additional areas you think could be growth opportunities for you guys?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Richard, I wouldn't want to put a number on the growth opportunities. I think, what we do, we do have a business development team, we're always looking at how we can leverage our core competencies. And what are some of our core competencies? Transportation, the technicians that we have in the field for our Sharps Management services, the consultants that we have in the field doing Steri-Safe, compliance services, so we do try to stick within that. Obviously, communications solutions was an offshoot of the very large call center we're running in Indianapolis for our recall and returns services. So we certainly want to look at those existing services that we have and how can we leverage that with those core competencies. That's how we look at it. We don't set a number that we have to have so many new services and we're very conservative before we start talking about them. And you know that from our past. We definitely play out the market, do a lot of analysis and research, do pilots and then launch. So it's worked for us in the past, we continue to use the same recipe for looking at new service lines.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "And then, I guess, final question for me is on the organic growth, the small quantity ratcheted down a little bit. Was there anything specific on that front that we should note or anything onetime or anything along those lines?", "Charles A. Alutto", "No, as we said last time on our last call, growth rates vary quarter-to-quarter, depending on the influx of both LQ and SQ customer contracts. We're within our guidance range and we've reiterated that guidance for the remainder of the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Francescone with Morgan Stanley.", "James Francescone - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "First, just one more on international. I know you touched on this, I mean, several times before but it still seems pretty impressive and that's a business that had been putting up 4% to 5% quarters for the past 8 quarters, and suddenly puts up a 9% quarter. Is there anything that was not sustainable or onetime that's worth calling out there? I mean, is that simply you had a really good quarter in recall this quarter or does it really feel like something more important has changed either in the environment or in your execution?", "Charles A. Alutto", "No. I think, we're hitting on some cylinders now with clinical services where we've moved out of the pilot stage in Spain, so we're starting to gain entry on the clinical service offering in Spain, as we've now built that SQ business through to 10 acquisitions that we've completed in Spain. Sharps is getting some leverage in markets like Ireland. We'll soon roll it out in the U.K. And recall obviously did impact it. I mean, it wasn't material but it had a little effect and brought it up in Q2, certainly.", "James Francescone - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Any way you could help us with a little more granularity on what the recall impact was?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "I think, it was maybe 1%.", "James Francescone - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. That's very helpful. And then, secondly, on margins, particularly on SG&A, obviously, you've done a better job leveraging the gross margin line over the past year or so. But SG&A has actually been going probably in the wrong direction. Even putting aside the amortization, is that -- is leveraging that line a priority of yours? I mean, how should we think about that going forward, particularly in relationship to any investment needs in some of your growth drivers?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, I think, you just hit it. I mean, obviously, it's an investment spend. We're now in certainly new lines of businesses like communication solutions, like StrongPak, these have really great growth -- long-term growth opportunities for us. So we will certainly make those investment spends. I think, we're very -- still very conservative when we come to spending. We look at resource allocation from different buckets that we have on the different lines of business. But certainly, it's attributable to the investment spend that we're making into this business for the long-term growth. And it also has something to do with acquisitions. Obviously, as we've made our way into the communications solution business, we haven't rationalized that SG&A yet, which we will over time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Barbara Noverini with Morningstar.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "As you guys grow the StrongPak business domestically and extend your reach, are you finding that you need to partner with third parties for final disposal or incineration of this material that you collect or are you internalizing most of this additional volume?", "Richard T. Kogler", "We use third parties for disposal or incineration. We have a pretty good platform in place that we built out over time to sort of allow ourselves to manage the waste, transfer the waste, bulk waste, things like that.", "Operator", "Your last question is from the line of Stewart Scharf with S&P Capital.", "Stewart Scharf - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research", "Could you just talk a little bit about price in the market and the mix based on your different markets and regions? Are you seeing any kind of improvement or worsening in price in any areas?", "Richard T. Kogler", "It's pretty much the same. I mean, as I said, I think, on an earlier question related to a competitor, very competitive business. So obviously, everybody is price-sensitive and we have to react to that, but otherwise, no changes.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no further questions in queue. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Thanks, Tracy. We appreciate everyone taking time to participate on today's call. Enjoy the rest of your summer and we'll see you on the road later this quarter. Have a great evening. Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining.

I will now turn the call over to Dan Ginnetti, Vice President of Finance. You may begin your conference.", "Dan Ginnetti", "Thank you, Mike. Welcome to Stericycle's quarterly conference call. Joining me on today's call will be Frank Ten Brink, CFO; Rich Kogler, COO; and Charlie Alutto, CEO.", "I will now read the Safe Harbor statement. Statements by Stericycle in this conference call that are not strictly historical are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and should be viewed with caution.

The company makes no commitment to disclose any revisions to forward-looking statements or any facts, events or circumstances after this date that may bear upon forward-looking statements.", "I will now turn it over to Frank.", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Thanks, Dan. The results for the third quarter are as follows: revenues were $534.6 million, up 11.3% from $480.5 million in Q3 of '12; and internal growth, excluding returns and recall revenues, was up 6.5%. Domestic revenues were $378.1 million of which $353 million was domestic regulated waste and compliance services, and $25.1 million was recalls and returns. Domestic internal growth, excluding recalls and returns revenues, was up 6.4%, consisting of SQ, up 8%, and LQ, up 5%.", "International revenues were $156.5 million, and internal growth adjusted for unfavorable exchange impact of $5.3 million was up approximately 7%. Acquisitions contributed $34.1 million to the growth in the quarter.", "Gross profit was $241.4 million or 45.2% of revenues. SG&A expense, including amortization, was $102.3 million or 19.1% of revenues. Net interest expense was $13.3 million, and net income attributable to Stericycle was $80.5 million or $0.92 per share on an as-reported basis and $0.96 adjusted for acquisition and other nonrecurring expenses.", "Now on the balance sheet. Our covenant debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.1 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of our revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $622 million. In the quarter, we repurchased 421,060 shares of common stock on the open market in an amount of $48.4 million, and we have authorization to purchase an additional 2.8 million shares. Our capital spend was $16.9 million, and our DSO at the end of the quarter was 62 days.", "Q3 year-to-date as reported cash from operations was $335.3 million. When adjusted for a $41 million customer deposit for recall reimbursement, year-to-date cash from operations was $294 million.", "I will now turn it over to Rich.", "Richard T. Kogler", "Thanks, Frank. In the quarter, we closed 17 transactions, 7 domestic and 10 international. The international acquisitions were 3 in Argentina, 2 in the United Kingdom, 2 in Romania, 1 in Mexico, 1 in Canada and 1 in Spain. Revenues from the 17 acquisitions were approximately $3.9 million in the quarter in annualized or approximately $60 million.", "We continue to use our strong free cash flow to drive our growth through acquisitions. Currently, our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust, with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business.", "Looking ahead, we remain excited about our growth opportunities. The record number of acquisitions in this quarter expands our customer base and the geographical reach of our services. This increase in customer base provides a long-term growth platform for selling multiple services, such as Steri-Safe, StrongPak, Sharps Management and Pharma Waste, that can more than triple the customers' revenues.", "At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 561,000 accounts, of which approximately 542,000 were small, the remainder were large.", "In closing, we want to thank each member of our worldwide team for their strong performance and continued commitment to our customers, our shareholders and our values.", "I'll now turn it over to Charlie.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Thank you, Rich. I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2013 and 2014. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements, and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration, acquisition-related and other nonrecurring expenses.", "For 2013, we believe analysts' EPS estimates will be in the range of $3.72 to $3.73. We believe analysts' revenue estimates for 2013 will be in the range of $2.13 billion to $2.145 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange rates. We anticipate 2013 internal growth rates to be: SQ, 8% to 10%; LQ, 5% to 8%; international, 5% to 8%; and recall and returns revenues between $95 million to $100 million. We believe analysts will have estimates for 2013 free cash flow between $353 million to $357 million. 2013 CapEx is anticipated to be between $67 million to $70 million.", "Now I'd like to provide preliminary guidance for 2014. For 2014, we believe analysts' EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.11 to $4.16 and a share count of 87.6 million, which we are comfortable with. We believe analysts' revenue estimates for 2014 will be in the range of $2.32 billion to $2.35 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange rates. We anticipate 2014 internal growth rates to be: SQ, 8% to 10%; LQ, 5% to 8%; international, 5% to 8%; and recall and returns revenues between $100 million to $120 million. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow in 2014 between $392 million to $397 million.", "2014 CapEx is anticipated to be between $70 million to $75 million.", "In closing, we are very pleased with our Q3 results and excited about the multiple growth opportunities for the future.", "Thank you for your time. And Mike, I'll ask you to open up the Q&A line.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair & Company.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Frank, let me start with a few, for you, housekeeping items. The tax rate was a little bit lower this quarter than we anticipated. So can you give us a little color on how that might shake on Q4? And then what are your tax rate assumptions for the EPS projection you provided for the forward year?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes. So for the year of 2013, it's about 35%, and then for next year, it's about 36%.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And then in regards to the $41 million deposit you mentioned for returns and recalls, that actually for you to go out and buy inventory. And second question related to that, how quickly will that flow through the income statement? It sounds like that will be pushed out given that you really didn't change the guidance for this year on returns and recalls.", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Now so this is what this is. A customer may at times put money with us that we use to reimburse for incoming product. This is not a revenue for us. This is just money that we are asked to use to reimburse for recalled products. So this is not an issue on an income statement for us. This is just the deposit with us that would then get outbound to their customers. So in this case, we've had this in 2011, if people remember, kind of a larger deposit made. In this case, it also was a larger deposit on a recall that we're working on.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay, perfect. And then maybe just a couple of big-picture questions. One on patient communications, if we could get an update there. I know you were through the integration of Beryl, and just want to get a feel for if you're focusing more on M&A there or what you're seeing on the organic growth front?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes, I think in the M&A front, there were 2 deals in the U.S. that were communication solution deals. So we certainly are focused on M&A. Sales efforts continue to evolve. The communication solution team has started to work very closely with our SQ and our LQ sales team, leveraging our relationships. The opportunity is out there right now in the marketplace, especially with the consolidation that's going on in health care, Ryan, where folks want to deal with one vendor for like services and communication solutions certainly falls within that. We are seeing evidence that there are more RFPs in this area, and we've won some nice contracts with some leading IDNs in the U.S.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. So is that mostly replacement opportunities out of existing vendors? Are you seeing greenfield, too, where people don't utilize some of these communication services? Is there a heavier weighting towards one in the organic growth outlook?", "Charles A. Alutto", "It's a combination. It is taking some market share from other folks in the industry. It's also where folks are doing an in-house, so hospital or doctors doing some of these functions in-house, and they're now outsourcing it to outside providers.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Charlie, just a follow-up on the patient communication question. Is this something where, I guess, that you're focused more on an LQ at the moment? Or given the platform of Beryl that the margin of customer coming in right now is on the SQ side?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, I think, it's both right now. We don't have one focus than the other. We're looking at the bigger picture. Obviously, when we first got into this space with the NotifyMD acquisition, that was more SQ-focused. Beryl gave us a nice platform to now add the LQ into the mix. And there was some crossover there or some services like after hour answering services that we sold on the SQ side, but now there's consolidation in the industry and large IDNs wanting to have one service provider that handle all their after-hour calls. So there is a lot of crossover, some SQ-like services that are now going into the LQ space. So it's really both that we're going after, both the LQ and the SQ.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "And what are the concerns or areas of touch points that your potential customer base may be expressing at this time for this service line?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, I think if you look at it, there are many different touch points. On the LQ side, like I said, if they're looking at all the locations they have, they might be looking for after-hour services of one vendor to provide a consistent after-hour service for all their locations. Post-discharge calls are getting a lot of attention now because of the reimbursement rates changing. Doctor's offices need to becomes more efficient, so products like appointment reminder certainly are a hot topic. So it's really across the board we're seeing different touch points in different facilities that we're servicing.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "But are they -- do you feel like or may you've expressed the words, \"There's a lot of work to do in this area,\" and that's both an opportunistic phrase, as well as challenges. Are there any conversion issues that you're coming across now that you can share or anything of that nature?", "Charles A. Alutto", "I mean it's the same that we said before. I mean, we're still working on building our common platform internally, which will help us better service our customers. And that's really the main player right now is the platform, software. So we can do a better job of consolidating some of the business that we've acquired.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "And just a clarification, 17 transactions, it sounded like 2 in-patient communication or communication services. What were the balance of the M&A service line?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, the other 15 were all in regulated waste, then the compliance services.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then finally, I mean, I hate to sound like I've been asleep for a while here. But obviously, the Affordable Care Act has had some impact on the business. Maybe it hasn't, but could you share sort of your thoughts on what this is doing and perhaps not doing to the end market, and maybe constructively, what the opportunistic -- opportunity is, say, in '14 and '15?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, I don't think our view has changed on the Affordable Care Act. I mean, certainly, there's been a lot in the news right now we think as it all plays out, there will be more people that are covered by insurance that creates for more volume, more volume potentially at SQ sites, which we think is a good thing for Stericycle. I think we're seeing some evidence of -- with this consolidation that larger IDNs we want to consolidate and go with one service provider. So certainly, we've seen some evidence of that. I think it is creating some uncertainty in the health care market. So it could potentially slow up the sales cycle and make the sales cycle longer on some of these. But I think those are the views that we've had for the last couple of quarters, and that really hasn't changed at all. And I think that goes forward into how we feel 2014 will play out.", "Operator", "The next question is from David Manthey with Robert Baird.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "First off, on the tax rate, Frank, can you talk about why it was lower this quarter specifically? I think your guidance you had said it would be in the high 35s. I think it came in at 32. Could you talk about that?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. Q3 is obviously a timing, where there potentially could be some release of all the reserves with respect to the statute of limitation. And that's what benefited the rate in the quarter.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And second, throughout all of 2012, those domestic LQ and SQ growth was at the high end of your targeted internal ranges. And I'm wondering, were there anything specific in terms of what moved the needle there. Did you ramp some major projects or something? And, I guess, more broadly, I know you're talking a lot more about StrongPak and some of the retail opportunity you had there, could you talk about how you charge for the StrongPak service? And is there sort of a channel fill situation there or not?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes, I think just to address StrongPak, as we've talked before, it's a service that we're now offering nationwide. And the way that we charge it basically is, it's on a per-stop basis, in some cases. In some cases, it's a flat rate. So it's sort of tailored to the customer's need, right? We still look at 750,000 retail locations in the U.S. and a market opportunity of $1 billion revenue. So the good thing is we know route business and know how to service customers who need compliance and waste disposal services. So we still think StrongPak is a very critical part of our growth.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay, but there was nothing specific. No specific major programs or anything that ramped up during 2012 that moved the needle higher than normal?", "Charles A. Alutto", "I think the thing to kind of keep in mind, and we've said this, I think, in prior conference calls, as growth rates vary quarter to quarter, that's why we give you a range of growth rates for LQ, SQ and the like. And I think that StrongPak did contribute in 2012, and it will continue to contribute, but the StrongPak customers do come in, in large, large amount. I mean, it's a major contract with a major chain. So you will see some impact on growth rate comparability.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay, all right. And then finally, along the same lines, if you could address patient communications. And is that an activity-based or subscription-based type service? Just to be -- and help us understand how you are billing for that.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, it is a good question, David. It is a recurring revenue, so it behaves a lot like a core mid-waste business in StrongPak, and these are longer-term contracts with predictable revenue that comes along with them.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. So it sounds like it's subscription-based then, not based on sort of number of calls taken or anything like that.", "Charles A. Alutto", "It's a combination depending on the service line.", "Operator", "The next question is from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer.", "Daniel Hultberg - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "This is Daniel Hultberg filling in for Scott. Going back to StrongPak, can you guys give us an update how that contributed in the quarter and also how we should think about the contribution when it comes to 2014 guidance?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, we don't break StrongPak out specifically. You'll see it obviously contributed to the growth rates in SQ and LQ, but we don't break it out specifically.", "Daniel Hultberg - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. Also, as far as guidance goes, what kind of gross margin expectations should we think about?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "I think, again, if you look at the gross margin for next year, again, you take Q3, you probably have your normal 10- to 15-basis-point improvement. There'll be a slight lift from the mix impact on the acquisitions. But that's a little bit offset by also a higher SG&A expense. And then for next year, again, our normal trend, about 10 to 15 basis points quarter-over-quarter is what we would guide for.", "Daniel Hultberg - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Great. One final for me, please. As far as the international growth in the quarter, can you take us a little deeper on the contributors there in terms of RMS and the Sharps Management and clinical service, please?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, on the breakdown for international growth, we did talk about a larger recall project that we had in Q2 that it was about a 1% to 1.5% increase. We did not see that again in Q3. We did have a 7% growth, so a good quarter in Q3. On international growth, we see the European escalators slowly improving. We are starting to get traction on clinical services certainly, and now it's Sharps Management. And then now we are offering more of a recall-type business in Europe. We might see the growth rate fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, depending on how large the recall that we handle on that particular quarter.", "Operator", "The next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I just want to go back to a question that was just asked before just in terms of the movement of the organic growth rates. And I appreciate your comments that the organic growth rates kind of move around quarter-to-quarter. But did you guys sense that there was any change in the momentum of your business on an underlying basis at all? Or is it just seem to be like exact to that, that there's anomaly -- I won't even say an anomaly, but just sometimes, it's higher. Sometimes, it's lower. I guess, the question is that should we think about the growth rates going forward being towards the lower end of the range because of tougher comps versus what we saw over the last year?", "Charles A. Alutto", "No. I think, I mean, to answer your question directly, there's really no change in underlying business, and we see always some are still hitting. And like we said, we're within our guidance. We've given indications of where we're going to be next year. The growth rates do vary, and the comparability can be a number of factors, influx of larger contracts or StrongPak or, as Charlie alluded to, other things that maybe going on. But frankly, we see very much steady state going forward.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just on the domestic front, can you give at least qualitatively more detail in terms of the growth coming from areas like Sharps, Pharma, Steri-Safe, StrongPak. Is there one area that was doing particularly better or doing particularly worse in the quarter?", "Richard T. Kogler", "Actually, I think that they're all doing pretty much online. I mean, I can give you an anecdote. This quarter, we signed our largest Pharma customer ever, a dramatically large customer. The team did a great job working on that for 6 months. So those are indications to me that, that multiple service, as well as others, are gaining traction. StrongPak has been a good contributor. So I don't really see any change in what we've discussed in prior quarters.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then Frank, tax rate for 4Q specifically, can you just tell us what to expect?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Say it again? Tax rate for which year?", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "For 4Q this year, '13, net quarter.", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "For the year, so it will be roughly 35% for the year. That's the rate I would use for the year.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "So I should use the roughly 33% this quarter and kind of average them out for...", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes, and then average out, so you get roughly 35%.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then in terms of the organic growth in the international basis, Charlie, I've talked to you for a while about that eventually accelerating. The 7% growth we saw in this quarter, I mean is that something that we should think about over time that we should over the next, say, year or 2 that we should expect better organic growth out of international?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. I think it's safe. I mean, we gave guidance. It's going to be 5% to 8%. Obviously, we're coming off 2 very good quarters, but obviously, there's a lot of different markets that we're in. Things change on the pricing front, but we're very confident we'll be in the guidance range next year of 5% to 8%.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And again, my last one, then I'll jump off. Can you just go over the geographic breakdown of those acquisitions? Again, I missed a bunch of that.", "Charles A. Alutto", "There were 2 in the U.K., 2 in Romania, 1 in Mexico, 3 in Argentina, 1 in Spain and 1 in Canada. That's a total of 10 international, and there were 7 domestic.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Kevin Steinke with Barrington Research Associates.", "Kevin M. Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Just wondering if you could speak to the mix of SQ versus LQ business on the regulated waste acquisitions that were made, both domestically and internationally, please?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes, the mix was about 30% SQ, 70% LQ.", "Kevin M. Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Was there any big variance international versus domestic or. . .", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "International is slightly higher than LQ, but not a lot.", "Kevin M. Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Anything unique about the Communication Solutions acquisitions that you made this quarter?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Nope. I mean, just the ones that we had done before and over time, really good synergized to be in our business.", "Kevin M. Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Then lastly, what sort of expectations do you have baked in to 2014 for SG&A as a percent of revenue?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes, I think if you look for the year with the acquisitions that now came in, for the year, you're looking roughly at 19.3%. Roughly, that's an approximation of a percent to revenue. And again, that's SG&A, including amortization and stock option expense.", "Operator", "Next question is from Michael Hoffman with Wunderlich Securities.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Charlie, on the international growth, historically, there's been an uptick in the fourth quarter. There's a seasonal aspect to that. Should we be expecting that same trend or as the mix changed enough that maybe that doesn't happen?", "Charles A. Alutto", "And you're referring to internal growth, Michael?", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Yes. Yes, I mean, just when you look at sequentially, you have a much stronger fourth quarter sequentially than you do through the course of the year. And I'm -- it's just a pattern of that going back several years.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Q3 tends be a little slower in some markets like Europe, from an overall business standpoint. So you can say that internal growth has an impact, but we're giving our internal growth number. It's quarter -- it's prior year guidance. It's prior year compared to this year, so that's really the comparable for internal growth. In general though, I will tell you that international business Q3 in Europe is slower.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then on the SQ domestic organic growth when we look at -- and I think I got the number written down, it was coming quickly. I think 8%, is that right?", "Charles A. Alutto", "That's correct.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Right. So how would you break it up between the price and volume component of that 8 versus the ancillary services part?", "Charles A. Alutto", "It's a little bit over the CPI on the price side and then volume in the industry is, obviously, a little better on the SQ than the LQ. So that's a couple of percentage points, and then the rest is the additional services.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So if I sort of work that math, CPI is running around 2%. So on SQ, it splits pretty evenly between price and volume and ancillary services.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, that's a good approximation.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "For the quarter, okay. And then if I think about that 4%, how would I divvy that up just proportionally between Steri-Safe up-selling or StrongPak or patient comps? Who's making the contribution in the quarter?", "Charles A. Alutto", "It's even very difficult for us to split that out because here's a customer that went from transactional maybe to Steri-Safe, but we don't really equate volume necessarily after, it's very difficult for us to measure that ourselves. And so we do it as a combo in total.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Give me one of the thesis from the story is there's this great opportunity to continue to up-sell, so you have to have some data point that says, \"Well we went from X number that didn't -- that was at the base level, but now they're in the middle level or they are the upper level,\" versus we have so many StrongPak customers or we don't, right? I mean, even at that level, you should be able to sort of figure out...", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. So what happens is the revenue per account, for instance, for a 3-doc practice, maybe somewhere in the 1,200 thousand -- 1,200 per year for medical waste, so now we can more than double that if they sign up for the whole suite of Steri-Safe. So that gives you a flavor what the opportunity is. But again, we don't break it out afterwards how much was volume afterwards because that's not what's being tracked.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "So then I guess from a management standpoint, how do you know whether you're being successful at improving in the up-sell? Just looking at the total dollar per customer?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, again, like I said, you have a customer that you have roughly a revenue on. And then in total, you see that, that revenue per customer is going up because they're signing up for those additional services.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Right. And I get that, but what point -- when do you realize that I should stop pressing so hard on the Steri-Safe and focus more on the other ones if you're not actually tracking the individual contribution?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Again, they all contribute, Michael. And so it is part and you need to look at the growth rate. So an 8% includes that. And so that's a very important part of the picture. That will tell you that things are on track.", "Operator", "Next question is from Erin Wilson with Bank of America.", "Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "On patient communications, how penetrated are you in your addressable market in that arena now? And then where do you think that can go over the near term and longer term? Do you hit some sort of meaningful inflection point at some point? And are there any potentially new regulatory issues in that particular arena that can cause -- that you could offer service for as well?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes, I think we've probably got a long way to go on the addressable market. We think it's a market opportunity. It's greater than $2 billion. Obviously, we're new into this space. We don't break it out, but it's one where we've got. We're in the early innings from the rollouts. So from an opportunity and this has got a long run ahead of us. I think your other question is, are there other services that we could add based on changes in regulations? Certainly, we're looking at that. We feel very comfortable where we are on the services we currently have, but over time, we will probably add additional services to that suite of menu that we give out on the whole Communication Solutions business.", "Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And I think before previously, you've said you're about 10% penetrated for the Pharma Waste. Could you give an update on that metric?", "Richard T. Kogler", "Yes, I don't think we've actually broken it out like that. But as we said, we continue to have good success, which is reflected in the LQ growth rates and obviously, it's a 200-plus million market opportunity that we've really just entered in the last couple of years.", "Operator", "Your next question is from David Lewis.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just one question. Charlie, I know the tone of the call is that metrics or trends really haven't changed in the results. But one thing here though that stands out to us is the LQ business across the last 4 quarters. If you look at the 12 period certainly stepped up from organic growth perspective versus the '10 and '11 -- I'm sorry, the '10-'11 periods. So there was that material step-up a year ago and that trend sort of continued. But in the last 4 quarters, we have seen LQ organic growth sort of go from upper single digits or 9% down to around 5%. That's a 4-quarter trend down. Can you just maybe talk to us through some of the factors that may be explaining why that's gone down 4 quarters in a row and why that's not a trend?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, I think when you look at LQ, you're talking about larger contracts. They are going to vary quarter to quarter depending on the timing of those contracts, whether or not we get a whole IDN that, let's say, takes our Pharmaceutical Waste services on. That's going to be a large influx of Rx Waste. StrongPak plays into LQ growth as well. So when you have StrongPak and Rx Waste over LQ, and it all comes in at one time, you can have that going to the upper end of our range of 9% in a particular quarter. So I think that really is the biggest impact on LQ, David.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And Charlie, sorry, one more quick question based on something you said earlier. One of the interesting things about ACA may actually be that virtually every hospital CFO we talk to is preparing for actually declining utilization in an in-patient basis and expanding utilization in outpatient and ambulatory care. I mean, that dynamic alone should be a positive mix driver for Stericycle. Have you had any way been to -- I mean, first off, maybe you've seen it in your business this year or last year, do you have any way of sort of quantifying what that could mean to your business on a multiyear basis?", "Charles A. Alutto", "We think -- we agree that the trend is heading in that direction. I think it aids both of our Medical Waste to Compliance business, as well as Communication Solutions business. I don't know if we've seen a meaningful enough yet to quantify, but we've seen some contract, like I've said especially on the Communication Solutions side that as they're growing their base of off-site services to meet Obamacare and these ACOs are being created, as well. They are looking at one service provider for a suite of services. And I think that certainly fits in well for both our Compliance services I've said before, and really now in our Communication Solutions side of the business. So we're seeing it in some RFPs and some wins. Nothing meaningful at this point, but certainly, the trend is heading in that direction.", "Operator", "Next question is from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "First one I had was on the international business, second one on ACA. On the international businesses, just wondering if you could maybe summarize the year-to-date margin improvement you think you see? And if you have a quantitative way to measure that? And the reason I ask is just trying to figure out what you think that trajectory looks like over the next 6, 12 months as you factor in the most recent range of deals. The international margin expansion piece in the story is obviously an important one.", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "I think the international, like the U.S., I mean their goal, too -- and that's obviously what they're trying to achieve is continuously adding that 10 to 15 basis points quarter-over-quarter through internal improvements. What you, however, do have happen in that sector is a larger size of acquisitions relative coming in and that can many times fluctuate the mix for them. So you may have the result of that, you see, if not necessarily all the way come through the EBIT. Q3 normally for them is a fairly flat quarter to sometimes even slightly down because of the volumes in Europe as Charlie talked about and then it picks up again in Q4 a little bit.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then on the ACA piece, I'm just wondering, Charlie alluded to sort of the increasing cadence of conversations regarding consolidation of services, such as yours. And I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the complexions we deal with when you speak with these IDN. Is it typically a CFO? Is there a Chief Procurement Officer that gets involved? I'm just trying to figure out kind of where you had the most success in penetrating sort of senior management levels these networks so that we have a sense of how quickly that sort of dynamic could take hold as ACA becomes a little more transparent of the process.", "Charles A. Alutto", "The good news is when we first started the business, our point of contacts are more just in procurement and maybe in environmental services, which we're selling, just Waste services. I think the sales team is the great job of building relationships higher up in the organization. And certainly, building those relationships at the same time, building the Stericycle brand, have led us an opportunity to start dealing with -- depending on the service though, Isaac, I mean, if it's Communication Solutions, it's going to be more marketing or the support services. If it's Pharmaceutical Waste, there could be Chief Procurement Officers and Pharmacy Directors. It really depends on the service that we're selling in there. But in the end, we are having a better luck because we have higher relationships within the IDNs, within the hospitals.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "If I could ask one last clarifying question on that item. If I sort of look specifically at the classic SQ-LQ parts of the business, and then try to assess where you guys have had the most success, can you characterize if you, at this point, spoken with maybe the majority of the major IDNs? Or is it still the minority when it comes to sort of the classic businesses and having conversations that are pretty senior level?", "Charles A. Alutto", "I'm looking at the whole suite of services. It's a minority at this point. So we think it's a great opportunity as we forward to talk to more and more. And some IDNs are not at that stage. They're more acquiring right now, not thinking building platform so it really depends on where they're at.", "Operator", "Next question is from Sean Dodge with Jefferies.", "Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Going back to Pharmaceutical Waste, we look across the hospital landscape, where do you think compliance rates stand? Currently, when it comes to properly disposing of that stuff. And secondly there, how big of an inflection in demand of that service did you see after Pharma Waste became part of the JCAHO audit?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Thanks, Sean. I think compliance rates are still relatively low. And the reason for that is there's a lot more state-driven from a regulatory standpoint. Having JCAHO now to look at the program and start to ask hospitals about compliance certainly helps. We've seen some evidence that, that has helped us in some of the sales over the last 12 to 18 months. But this is still more of a state-driven. We have some states that are definitely focused on this, and we see compliance rates a lot higher. In other states, they are lower.", "Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And how long ago was Pharma Waste added to the JCAHO audits? How long they've been auditing for that now?", "Charles A. Alutto", "A little bit over about 18 months.", "Operator", "The next question is from Richard Close with Avondale Partners.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Question here on, I guess, the internal growth rates and as we think about 2014, and I just want to touch on the Large Quantity being at the low end, at 5% to 10% or 5% to 8%, but most recently 5%. If you think about next year at the 5% to 8%, what gets you, I guess, from the low end to the upper end in terms of 2014 on the Large Quantity? Maybe the puts and takes on that line item, please.", "Charles A. Alutto", "I think if you look at the contributors to growth, it's Sharps Management, Rx Waste and StrongPak. So if all 3 hit at a very good pace, then it gets to the higher end of the range. It's not like we're adding new services to get to the higher end of the range. We're comfortable with the services that we have depending on timing of contracts and larger contracts. We'll depend on what we do in the quarter and obviously, it's going to vary quarter-to-quarter. But those are the 3 contributors to growth that certainly impacted. So if all 3 hit on a higher rate, we're going to be at the higher end. But we're very comfortable with the range.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "So when we look at, I guess, the internal growth rates for all of the divisions for next year, are you assuming any additional product lines coming into the business, like patient communications or StrongPak anything like that, that helps assist growth going forward? Or is it just what's in your bag right now?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, certainly, it's what's in the bag right now. But were always enhancing the program offerings which sometimes helps escalate the sales process where we're comfortable with what we have right now are always looking to make improvements to those offerings.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Have we seen in any of the acquisitions, any additional service lines or offerings that maybe are not in a prime time, ready for prime time mode right now similar to StrongPak, I think, a couple of years ago that you got through an acquisition?", "Charles A. Alutto", "No, not in this last quarter.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "In may be the quarter previous? Anytime this year? Anything that you can talk about that you're incubating?", "Charles A. Alutto", "In the previous quarter, did the RMS deal in the U.K. which added to our platform in Europe.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Final question for me as you look at the divisions, the domestic, SQ and LQ, and then you think about international. International seems to be on an uptick over the last couple of quarters, maybe LQ, trending down as was noted earlier. Where do you see the most opportunity in 2014? Where do you think is going to be the area that shows the most strength?", "Charles A. Alutto", "I think the benefit of Stericycle is we've got multiple opportunities in each of the market. So we feel really good about SQ with Steri-Safe and StrongPak and LQ with Pharma Waste, Sharps and StrongPak in the LQ line as well. And the international market, with the expansion of RMS now in recalls and returns, and clinical services and Sharps Management certainly, we feel good about all 3 of our main lines of businesses in those 3 areas.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And I'll slip one final one in. Frank, just a clarification. On the SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue, the 19.3% number that you threw out there that includes the amortization and stock comp, was that for this year or for 2014?", "Charles A. Alutto", "In fact, it's equal this year to next year, which really would mean that Q4 will be a little bit higher. And that's again a result of the influx of the acquisitions. They were running at a higher rate. So the SG&A in Q4 is probably going to be somewhere around 19.6%. But the margin also got benefited there a little bit to gross margin as I mentioned the acquisition mix was favorable there.", "Operator", "Next question is from Barbara Noverini with MorningStar.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "With customers wishing to consolidate services into one contract, are you gaining better ability to craft longer contracts in exchange for being a one-stop shop? Perhaps, you offer customers smaller price increases year-over-year, as they accept all the larger suite of services and stay with you for a longer period of time?", "Charles A. Alutto", "That hasn't really changed the length of the contract in the LQ space, 3 to 5 years on the SQ space, 5 years. So it really materially hasn't changed the length of the contract, Barbara.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Are those contracts lengths similar to internationally as well?", "Charles A. Alutto", "It could be a little bit longer internationally. There's is a variance international where it could be as little as a year but up to 10 years in certain geographies.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Jason Rogers of Great Lakes Review.", "Jason Rogers", "Looking at the other expense line, the $1.3 million, could you indicate what that was?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "That can fluctuate based on things like currency. That's probably the biggest swing factor that can happen there. And the rest it's as a whole slew of things that can fluctuate and has so between anywhere like a $0.6 million to $1.5 million. Currency is a big driver there.", "Jason Rogers", "Speaking of currency, what's your estimate for the currency impact on sales for the fourth quarter?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Again, that's too early. I mean, it will -- overall still, FX is a little bit of a headwind. We see that the currencies in Latin America are weakening a little bit. So we do anticipate that currency will have an impact, probably a couple of million at least in the foreign exchange in Q4.", "Jason Rogers", "And you indicated you have signed up your largest Pharma customer ever in the quarter, what business was that?", "Charles A. Alutto", "We don't disclose any customer information, but it was Rx Waste. Pharma Waste, I'm sorry.", "Jason Rogers", "And then finally, accounts receivable up 18%, a little bit higher than the sales increase, is that due to the acquisitions?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. This acquisition, as I mentioned, the DSO count was 1 day down versus the prior quarter. There was obviously only $3.9 million in revenues in the quarter for those acquisitions. So if you think your average daily sales, you'd be too low what the ongoing amounts are on the balance sheet representing that receivable.", "Operator", "Next question is from Stewart Scharf.", "Stewart Scharf - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research", "Could you talk a little about the general market environment? And I mean, your growth rates you're guiding to is generally consistent into '14 and hasn't changed much of the consistent growth. What would change any of those range, the range of 8% to 10%, SQ international, are there any specific markets that would impact those forecast?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "No, I think, Stewart, when we give a pretty wide range. So I think there are material changes -- not material change. Let's say European had a price slowdown in RPI pricing that has an effect on the business. But because of the ranges we give, I think we feel real comfortable that if there is something in the marketplace that we'll still be within that range. It's a steady market for us on all the different fronts on our business lines. So we don't really anticipate anything that would fluctuate greatly from the guidance that we've provided.", "Stewart Scharf - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research", "Okay. And regarding the recalls and returns, you're looking at $100 million to $120 million in '14, how do you arrive at that range? Is it just based on historical recalls?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, I think the historical side, obviously, the recall trend is they've had continuously more recalls in this year versus last year. We have a very good repeat side in that business, so that obviously feeds the funnel over time, and that the difference between the $100 million and $120 million is merely having or not having larger recalls in the year or not.", "Stewart Scharf - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research", "Okay. And as far as acquisition multiples, would you say it's still in the historical range 4 to 8x, or is it closer to the 8x now?", "Charles A. Alutto", "No, it's definitely in the 4 to 8x, and that was also true for the third quarter.", "Operator", "There are no further questions. I will turn the call back over to the presenters.", "Dan Ginnetti", "Thank you, Mike. We appreciate everyone taking time to participate on today's call. Enjoy the cooler temperatures, and we'll see everybody on the road later this quarter. Have a great evening.", "Operator", "That concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Dan Ginnetti, VP of Finance. You may begin your conference.", "Dan Ginnetti", "Thank you, Rachel. Welcome to Stericycle's quarterly conference call. Joining me on today's call will be Frank Ten Brink, CFO; Rich Kogler, COO; and Charlie Alutto, CEO.", "I will now read the Safe Harbor statement.

And internal growth, excluding returns and recall revenues, was up 7.1%. Domestic revenues were $394.6 million, of which $368.2 million was domestic regulated waste and compliance services.

The unused portion of the revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $573 million.", "In the quarter, we repurchased 424,729 shares of common stock on the open market in an amount of $49.2 million, and we have authorization to purchase an additional 2.3 million shares.", "Our capital spend was $18.8 million, and our DSO was 63 days.", "Q4 year-to-date as reported cash from operations was $403.5 million. When adjusted for recall reimbursements discussed last call and one-timers, cash from operations was $402.6 million.", "And I will now turn it over to Rich.", "Richard T. Kogler", "Thanks, Frank. In the quarter, we closed 8 transactions, 1 domestic and 7 international. The international acquisitions were 3 in the United Kingdom, 2 in Romania, 1 in Canada and 1 in Spain.", "Revenues from the 8 acquisitions were approximately $0.7 million in Q4 and annualized are approximately $37.4 million.", "We continue to use our strong free cash flow to drive our growth through acquisitions. Currently, our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business.", "Looking ahead we remain excited about our expanding growth opportunities. Our global acquisition strategy increases and our customer base, providing a long-term growth platform for selling multiple services, such as compliance solutions, StrongPak, Sharps Management and pharma waste. As customers adopt our multiple services, they can more than triple their revenues.", "At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 566,000 accounts, of which approximately 546,000 were small, the remainder were large.", "In closing, we want to thank each member of our worldwide team for their strong performance and continued commitment to our customers, our shareholders and our values.

We'll now answer any questions. Rachel, you can open the Q&A line.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Ryan Daniels with William Blair & Company.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Let me start with one on StrongPak. We've seen some news lately about more retailers, again, facing fines out in California in early January. I'm curious if that's, one, driving more demand. And #2, are you starting to see more states crack down and that appears to be California-specific at this point?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. Anytime there's awareness, we think that's good, Ryan. Certainly, California has been on the forefront when it comes to states. There has been other states in the U.S. that are starting to -- and have been focusing on this. I would tell you that as retail expands into new geographies and more into health care, I think, that certainly helps us. Obviously, we can provide a serviceable medical waste, health care waste, and especially hazardous waste. And we have a healthy pipeline of orders from all the awareness and the enforcement of regulations that really have been on the books for many, many years.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Helpful. And then, switching gears to Communication Solutions, I know last quarter you talked about leveraging your LQ and SQ team relationships to foster organic growth there. Can you talk a bit about how that's played out and what the reception has been among the current client base?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Actually, Ryan, I just attended our national sales meeting last week, where we began to cross-train our health care reps. We had both of our health care SQ, LQ reps together with our Communication Solution reps, so it is starting to take shape. We're excited about that cross-sell opportunity. I think, it's something that will gain momentum as the year goes on.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. Good deal. And then, I guess, just one quick one on all the noise in Utah. There seems to be some debate about maybe moving the incinerator out there. Is that in your capital budget for 2014 or will that be something modestly incremental if you decided to do that?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "It would be modestly incremental. I mean, we have a legal right to operate in North Salt Lake City and our facility is totally in compliance right now but we're always looking at all options, including relocation. I mean, frankly, the relocation process involves many steps and a lot of decision points and nothing has been finalized, it's very preliminary. The capital involved in it is not large. And more importantly, there'd be no material impact to customers or to the company if we do decide to relocate.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Hamzah Mazari.", "Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just a question on the international business. Could you maybe talk about which countries you do see SQ opportunity in, similar to the U.K. market? And any regulations, positive or negative, on the horizon we should be aware of?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. I think, Hamza, on the international side, certainly, we think, in almost every international market, we have an opportunity on the SQ side. When we look at comparing it to the U.S., we look at where are we right now with respect to our clinical service offerings, which for those that don't know, it's very similar to our Steri-Safe offering, bundling certain services, compliance solution services with our regulated waste program. And in some of the markets outside of the U.S., you mentioned the U.K., certainly, that's one of them. Canada, Portugal. Our latest entry where we're spending out a good amount of time of rolling out Clinical Services is in Spain. We're getting some really good results early on. I think, we're on track there. So we'll continue to expand that program in the international markets.", "Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Great. And just a follow-up. You're in many more ancillary services than 5, 6, 7 years ago. Could you give us a sense of how many of these ideas are coming from your customers relative to how many are you thinking about internally? And internally, do you have a formalized strategy team developed? How do we think about where you are in that process relative to history?", "Charles A. Alutto", "I think -- great question. I think, the customer plays an important role, even when we think internally about a service offering, whether it be Steri-Safe, Clinical Services, Pharmaceutical Waste, we have customer advisory councils, not only in the U.S. but in our international markets as well, and we continue to balance ideas off of customer bases, one, to find out if we're on track for the service offering, but more importantly, to find out what the pressure points are for those accounts and what can we do to address those pressure points. So -- and sometimes, it doesn't lead to a new program, but it might lead to an enhancement of an existing program like Steri-Safe.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Just to touch on the acquisition front. I'm curious, are all of the transactions medical waste related or any other ancillary services specific?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "There were 7 in regulated waste and 1 in the Communication Solutions side.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Fair to say that communication was domestic?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "The communication was in Canada.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. All right. For some that's domestic. I'm curious, on Spain, where was the largest acquisition made? Because this is something, I think, maybe some of us were looking for in terms of the next leg of expanding the platform you established in Spain a couple of years ago. But first, maybe what was the largest acquisition made and then talk about the one in Spain specifically, please?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes. We don't give details on individual acquisitions or the size by country. But if you really think about Spain over the last couple of quarters and really since we got in, there's pretty much acquisitions done every quarter. Some are smaller, some are larger. Again, our focus has been to expand the Small Quantity Generator size of their customers and that's what they've really focused on and they've done a really good job.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Can we go to gross margin here for a second? I think, after the onetime litigation, it was 45%. I think, that's a little maybe lighter than you were looking for. Can you talk about the mix there? And specifically, is there 1 service that may be scaling faster that was a little bit of a drag on the overall performance? Still strong at 45%, but maybe a little bit lighter than we were looking for?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes, good question. So the foreign exchange was about 8 basis points headwind. We had slightly better foreign exchange rate in the European side versus our original guidance. The mix, which really was driven by stronger sales in StrongPak impacted it by about 40 base -- sorry, 24 basis points, unfavorable because the margin there is still lower than the company average. And then, the general business improved by about 13 basis points.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, if I may try to talk a little bit more about Utah. Just on a broader scale, why is it not a bigger concern or should not be a bigger concern if you decide to exit a market with the facility? And again, I'm appreciating the volume and the dollar level that plant contributes, but why is this not -- why should we not be as concerned about it?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. Al, it's really not a decision of exiting a market. Even if we were to relocate the plant, it's not as if we were getting out of that marketplace. I mean, our contracts are not site-specific to where we treat the waste. We have a contract to collection, the transportation and disposal of that medical waste, and that contract is not site-specific that it has to go to 1 plant or the other. We obviously use our whole network around the collection. Incinerators go down from time to time. We use other incinerators when incinerators are down for maintenance, sometimes they're down for weeks or 1 month at a time. So that's why this is not a site-specific exiting of a market type of discussion.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And what's the timeframe on maybe resolution in this particular matter?", "Richard T. Kogler", "As I said, right now, we're in compliance and we're operating legally at the location that we're at. We're looking at other options but there's no specific timeframe because there's many steps involved here. And besides that, we may not move in the relocation kind of direction. So I -- there is no timeframe I could give you here. We're simply looking at all options.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "And the -- but what is the -- sorry about this, but what's the business issue here that's being raised as a flag?", "Richard T. Kogler", "I think, if we're going to kind of summarize it here, what you really have is you have a situation where some nearby residents object to our incinerator, even though we've been operating there for 24 years and we have a legal right, we're fully compliant. So with that in mind, it makes sense for us to look at other options, including relocation to somewhere else in Utah. But as Charlie said, the underlying issue here is not a big issue for us because we have 7 other incinerators operating throughout the U.S., with plenty of available capacity. We routinely move waste around because all these incinerators shut down throughout the year for maintenance, routine maintenance. And so there's no material impact here to the customers or to the company. It's simply a business issue that we're working through.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "A couple of housekeeping on the acquisitions on -- I understand there was just 1 U.S., but could you give us a feel for the percentage of the annualized revenue, what is U.S., what's domestic?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Most of it was international.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "And LQ-SQ mix in the U.S. and the international overall?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "It's about the same between the 2. SQ was about 30% and large quantity about 70%.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, I guess, RMS was a solid year, not a spectacular year, and the guidance was for a little bit better in '14 and unchanged on this update. Can you just give us a feel for what you're seeing on the macro horizon there? Any regulations or any activities that might slow or speed or just what's impacting that market and how you're thinking about it?", "Richard T. Kogler", "I mean, I think, we're always encouraged because, in 2013, we managed a record number of events compared to prior year. So a lot of this is awareness and activity in the market, which is being driven by regulations and things like that. We also expanded our services during the year to Canada and Europe. So all of these things sort of gives us more reach. We've always said it's an uneven business. And so our guidance for 2014, the 100 to 120 really says that on the higher end, we are assuming several larger blowout events. And I guess, the lower end says we're sort of steady state, continuing to grow and still at good organic rate.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Fair enough. Also patient communication, I saw the acquisition in Canada, would you say you're still in an acquisitive phase? It feels like about 1 a quarter, but how does that go organically, just an update between the mix of what's driving it and how do you feel about pushing the rollout?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. I mean, we continue to make acquisitions in that space. And I think, you will continue to see that in the future. Of course, although we don't guide to anything on acquisitions. I think, we're making significant progress on the operational infrastructure, that includes things, Scott, like upgrading our hardware and our backup systems. We continuously improve our telephony and application software. All this allows us to better service our customers. More importantly, it makes us more efficient on the operational side, which will in the end help us to integrate future acquisitions better than we are today.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "And one more if I may. Just on the Health Care Act. Could you just remind us on your view on how that will be impactful and anecdotally you're seeing thus far?", "Charles A. Alutto", "On the Affordable Care Act, really, no change to our view. I mean, there's obviously a lot of noise and press around the number of folks that are accessing health care. In the end, we think that it will certainly increase the volume. We anticipate to see more, in short, more people covered, which will increase volume. Probably a better opportunity on the SQ services and folks now that don't have insurance go to LQ will migrate to SQ. We think that's favorable for us since we have a broad service offering and really good broad service offering in the SQ space. So really, I think, that hasn't changed. So even though we're into 2014 now, our view of the Affordable Care Act has not changed at all, Scott.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I just want to, I guess, just start with a housekeeping question, Frank. Is the free cash flow for the year if $330 million, did I calculate that correctly, like, what, $23 million lower than the range?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "That is correct. So in the quarter, if you look at the $403.5 million in cash from ops, that's where the shortfall was. So if you adjust that for the recall reimbursement and kind of onetime events, you would come to about $402.6 million, which is about $20 million lower than we have given guidance on. That really is driven by timing differences on our kind of 2 main, 1 accounts payable, and some accrued liabilities and 1 day in the DSO, that's about $15 million to $20 million. So that's where we will recover that, we feel, most of this in 2014. And as a result, we've taken the free cash flow up by $10 million because we think some of that will shift right into the new year.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "So why isn't the guidance for free cash flow like $23 million?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "$23 million, you mean compared to the $20 million shortfall?", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Yes, it looks like the $23 million shortfall was -- however or whatever you want put in, like why isn't [indiscernible] same amount if it's a timing issue?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "So we were $20 million short. And we think we're going to recoup at least $10 million, it depends on the DSO, which we're right now started the year, which we're conservative on.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, Charlie, organic growth was ticked back up again midpoint of the range, 7.1% in regulated medical waste. Is there any real change in the business tempo from quarter to quarter? Are these just like such small vagaries that we're just kind of splitting hairs over here? How should we think of that?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. I think, as we've said in previous calls, we're going to see growth rate. They're always going to vary quarter-to-quarter. When you think about our latest quarter, domestically, I would just characterize it that all of our growth engines performed really well in the quarter, especially StrongPak. And I think, that's why you saw us come back on the higher end of the range, both the SQ and the LQ growth this quarter. We're always going to fluctuate, we said that on the last several calls now. But certainly, everything performed really, really well.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Good. And then, Frank, what should we think for the tax rate? The tax rate has been moving down where we continue to see here, I think, at like 34.5%, it's down about 80 basis points. What should we think about for 2014?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes. The guidance right now, I would say, it's in the mid-35s is a good starting point. And so you're right, we ended the year at 34.5% for the year-to-date.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "So is there -- is it the growth in international that's moving the tax rate down?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "I think, that is a little bit. Every year, you also have some factors in, mostly in the third quarter, where you saw us to have a lower rate, where you have substantial limitation items that come up, so that can vary between year to year. So we're comfortable right now to kind of start the year with the mid-35s.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Erin Wilson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Can you speak to some of the ancillary services that you've implemented overseas? Have they gained meaningful traction? And I guess, are there any specific services that you've come across maybe in Spain or in the U.K. that could be transferable to your U.S. customer base?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Sure, Erin. I think, when you think about ancillary services overseas, we look at our Sharps Management service, that's something that we've now taken out into Canada, U.K. and Ireland market. Ireland has done a really good job. We've gotten some thought leaders in Dublin on the program. Great showcase for us to expand that, not only within Ireland, but a great showcase for other parts in Europe as well. Clinical Services continues, as I mentioned before, Clinical Services is certainly an offering that we've tested the latest market in Spain, getting really good results on expanding our relationship with the SQ customers. Comm Sol is one that -- we talked about our recall and returns business that we acquired in the U.K. in Q2 of 2013 that had a call center element to it. So we've been able to expand some of the call center services that we have in the U.S. Really early stages there, but I think that's something that could have an opportunity in other international markets. And then, your question around are there other things that we can -- that we're finding in certain markets that we can bring back to the U.S. Certainly, in Spain, we found a few SQ companies that kind of bundled instead with a client service offering at a bundling with no symmetry. That's a radiation detection service for those that might be exposed to radiation in providing x-rays. I don't know necessarily if that's one where we could take that and bring it to the U.S. But certainly, it's got a great opportunity in some of our other international markets. And then, we're seeing some of the things that the U.K. recall and returns business did locally in the U.K. that are starting to share some of those ideas. And those ideas could come back to the U.S. So a lot going on ancillary services, we're finding new offerings overseas. Not necessarily mean we have to leverage all of them in the U.S. but they could be applicable in other international markets.", "Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "That's great. And I guess, I've seen a few articles out there but do your communications efforts at all address the business aspect of compliance HIPAA-related protocol as it relates to social media and that practice as far as kind of medical practice websites or other types of social media that may be out there? Do you intend to kind of address that area in any way?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. Certainly, I've done some customer visits, I know social media and HIPAA is a big deal for some of the health care organizations. We actually do on behalf of some large health care companies, we actually do some monitoring of social media sites for them for a variety of reasons and we act as a back office for some of those calls related to that. We do have a HIPAA compliance part of our Communications Solution. And we think that's what differentiates our offering versus a lot of the small competitors in the marketplace that maybe aren't HIPAA-compliant in their communications. And when we talk about HIPAA compliance, we think more around our Steri-Safe offering, where we've added a HIPAA compliance component where we now do training, both live and in person and WebEx training for our employees. So HIPAA is certainly getting a lot of attention and we're trying to meet that not only on the Communications Solutions side, but on our compliance solutions side as well.", "Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And broadly speaking on that front, I mean, just with increased regulations, are you seeing greater traction there, either for Steri-Safe or Communications?", "Charles A. Alutto", "I think, the service offering, certainly, on Steri-Safe is more robust now because of the HIPAA Compliance Program. And we are starting to slowly see some additional traction on that side of the business. I think, it's too early on the Communications Solutions side to say that we've seen anything material there.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets.", "Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "You've done a really nice job the last 5 or 8 years adding in or layering in additional services. Can you give us some sense just how successful it's been, either what the percentage of revenue is in all of these services relative to just the core medical waste, or any other way to give us a sense how -- maybe how much they're contributing to growth? Just trying to grade the performance and broadening out the base that you've done over the last how many years?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes. So if you look at the Small Quantity Generator, the 8% to 10% kind of guidance we give, roughly 40% 50% of that growth comes from kind of price and volume in the market. And the remainder is really the additional services. So this is the Compliance, this is Steri-Safe, StrongPak, some Comm Sol, Communications Solutions feed. That gives you kind of a flavor on the SQ side. For the large quantity, the 5% to 8%, 10% to 20% of that is about price and volume. And the remaining, again, is the additional services. So this is the Sharps Management, the Pharmaceutical Waste. Again, StrongPak contributes to that. And right now, it's a little bit of Communication Solutions just starting to feed into that.", "Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "So does that mean there's no more growth in the core medical waste? It's all -- because you just said pricing and then ancillary? Or is there a component that's selling more...", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "So the 10% to 20% and the 40% to 50% includes a component of volume in there. So we are getting obviously some newer customers, and those customers we grow with the additional services.", "Charles A. Alutto", "And Gary, we've always said that a majority of our SG&A is building that relationship with the existing customers to add on services. So the majority of our time selling isn't to our existing customers.", "Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Right. Okay. All right. And then, just 1 cleanup one. Would you be willing to give us the split of the $32.4 million by the 3 segments that's the, what, M&A contributed to the revenue growth in the quarter?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Say that again? The amount that is...", "Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "The $32.4 million year-over-year contribution of M&A, can you give us that from U.S. ex returns and recall, U.S. returns and recall and international?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes. So about $10 million of that was in the United States and the rest was international.", "Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Great. And then, just one last question. I know it's not a huge miss, but this is the second year in the last 3 when you've not achieved the 15% long-term EPS growth target. And the initial '14 guidance, while probably conservative, falls a few points below that. Should we question the ability to achieve this target over the long term? Is there anything particular you'd point out? If the M&A pipeline is indeed as big as it sounds like, is there a reason you're not being more active? Any thoughts on the next few years in that long-term growth rate?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "No. The goal is still the same. Our goal is 15%, and that's what we're shooting for. Sometimes you make it, sometimes maybe no, but that doesn't mean that the goal is going away. And we feel we have a very good and robust pipeline for our -- as Rich said, well north of $100 million in annualized revenues, and that's domestic and international. So we feel very good about our growth opportunities.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Michael Hoffman with Wunderlich Securities.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Frank, can we come back to the free cash flow issue and the working capital and can you just help me understand what was moving around and why you're confident you'd get it back on the working capital side?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes. So the cutoff for this year was kind of interesting. We had New Year on a Wednesday. And many of our checks runs are done on the Thursdays. And so much of that cash was already funded right before the year end, as a result, the funding went out for that [indiscernible] to supply all those cash and those check runs. So that's what's impacted it from a timing point of view and we feel clearly that will come right back into this year because you kind of funded something that could have slipped, right, we could have held onto it but we keep our processes going. And so it was really a cutoff and the timing and the same was the case with some accrued liabilities on the payroll for instance, the cutoff was right there on that point. So we'll get that back. That's why we're confident and why we took our free cash flow up.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And I -- and so I get the movement but back to the original question, a question was asked earlier, you're not assuming you'll get all of it back?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "No. We were cautious. Kind of on the DSO side, we said there was 2 components to it. The DSO side we kind of are saying, okay, that one, we don't know if we are or are not, we're going to work on that and we'll give more updates on that over the year. Yes, we are going to try to shoot for it but it's early in the year and you know us with guidance, we're not going to write away, everything will come out. So that's really a conservatism, we hope.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Fair enough. And can you share with us, 1 day on a DSO tends to equal what in working capital typically?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "I think, if you look at it, it's about a $7 million to $8 million.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. All right. Very good on that side. And then, up through the 9 months, you've been splitting out acquisition costs versus integration expense and you bundled them back together in the fourth quarter. What's -- how does the $0.07 break up?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "I don't have it right in front of me. I can follow up with you. It's really in the same category for us between the 2 as we see it. So from a press release point of view, we brought it out and brought it together.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. I wouldn't mind it broken out just because we...", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Okay. We'll take that into -- at the next press release, we can do that.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "And the thinking behind it is that acquisitions are period costs and integrations cost of doing business.", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes. Acquisition on a pretax was about $4 million.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. That helps. And then, any of the 3 of you, Charlie or Rich or Frank, within the Small Q 9%, or the LQ 7% domestically, how would you proportion in this quarter how you did on price volume versus the ancillary as a mix of that? How do you think that broke up in this quarter?", "Charles A. Alutto", "I don't think it's materially different than what Frank answered the other question on and breaking out what is coming from the ancillary services, except that we had a stronger StrongPak in this quarter as compared to last quarter. And that's when Frank gave you the bridge on gross margin, why there was a little pressure on the gross margin side. So a little bit better on StrongPak quarter-to-quarter.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "And if I'm remembering correctly, StrongPak is in the SQ?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Mostly in the SQ but it also impacts the LQ as well.", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "More SQ than LQ.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Right. So that helps to account for the bump up to the upper end of the range versus where we've been trending?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. Correct. That is correct.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "All right. And so I wanted just a little bit more detail on that. I mean, typically, if I remember correctly, there is that dip in margin and then the return is pretty much within the next quarter. I mean, you have that set up and expense related to that first round of it and then it settles in. So there's a bump in revenues and then the pace settles, so like I'll have a tougher comp next year because of it?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes. You get revenue obviously if you get a bump, then in the year later, it becomes part of the base. And from a margin point of view, that's where the team has the opportunity to further improve density to improve those routes and to get more efficient. So obviously, they are having a continuous improvement program in place to continuously get that margin to improve and they've done a nice job there.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "All right. And then, last question. Coming out of the EPA office of resource conservation, they're talking about issuing a notice of federal record around retail. It sounds like they're coming out with much stronger rules and regs. Can you share any insight on that?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. EPA, the notice of data availability. EPA is soliciting in for how to manage retail haz waste. There has been already delays in that solicitation several times, and one of them is because of the government shutdown. I mean, we view this as potentially could increase awareness in the marketplace, especially among those medium and small retailers. We'll see about the date. Just to remind you, Michael, as you know, the Pharmaceutical Waste, there is supposed to be guidance coming out on Pharmaceutical Waste or universal waste. And I think that's been delayed 3 or 4 years now. So we'll see if they meet this latest time horizon they set for the release of this solicitation. But any -- at the end, we think the awareness will be a positive impact and bring some clarity to retailers in the disposal of hazardous waste.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I think, there's been a question -- if we move down into pricing a little bit more, you gave some color on your assumptions for pricing that's embedded for 2014 guidance. I was wondering if you could help us with the baseline and give us a sense of how pricing shaped up in 2013. Was it better or worse than what you're guiding to for this year?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "No. '13 and '14, again, for us, very similar. Our business were stable. And so what I just mentioned as to the contribution from price and volume, we have no different assumptions there.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. That's helpful. And then, just a follow-up on the acquisitions. Maybe give us a little bit of color on what you expect to do in terms of impact of margin this year? In the past, you've obviously been in a near-term drag, given the size and the scale. And so, if we just check your guidance a little bit, it looks like just in spite of the deal flow here, you're expecting a little bit of margin improvement. And I haven't had a chance to take all the numbers but just eyeballing the guidance, it does look like you're assuming margin to improve a bit. So I'm just wondering if you could comment a little bit about how that dovetails with your deals?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes. So in the first quarter, because we're coming up a quarter off, again, more acquisitions, that the margin probably is going to be a little bit more flat and then coming out for year-to-year. If you look at it in a total, you then are going to see that 20 bps improvement quarter-over-quarter. The team obviously is synergizing deals, that helps, and then the general trend that we've always had, that 10 to 15 bps improvement kicks overall on an average. But definitely, Q1 is normally a little bit, for us, softer. Any improvement in it comes more into Q2, 3 and 4.", "Operator", "Your next question is from David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Could you discuss puts and takes from foreign exchange in your 2014 guidance relative to the updated guidance? And then, if you could give us a share count range you're assuming?", "Charles A. Alutto", "David, a very good question. Obviously, we're having our revenues and things in Latin America and Canada's exchange rate also has gone a little bit less favorable. It's about a $21 million headwind to us. And so the acquisitions of $37 million that got added have a counter to that of about $21 million as a result of foreign exchange. Again, mostly Latin America, and then Canada are the contributors to that. And the share count that we're assuming for this coming year is $87.3 million.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "$87.3 million?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then, the second on this Utah thing, you said that you're in compliance and up and running and so forth and in compliance with your permits. But I was under the assumption there was some kind of an assertion, I don't know who it was from, that there was some sort of wrongdoing going on there. Is there anything -- are there any pending investigation you can tell us about or anything that's lingering there or is it just there was an assertion and none of it is true, you're operating under your permits and everything is fine?", "Richard T. Kogler", "The state of Utah issued a single NOV, what we call notice of violation, which was related to a December 2011 emissions test. We are contesting that NOV, and that involves a legal review process, which we're currently engaged in. The process continues and these things take time. There's nothing else to report at this point.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And is it safe to say that these sorts of things happen frequently to you?", "Richard T. Kogler", "I wouldn't characterize it is frequently. This is the first time that we've had an NOV in Salt Lake City in 24 years. That's why we're taking it very seriously and we're taking it through the whole process.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I see. Okay. And then, final question is on incentives. Could you give us an idea of how your people are compensated to sell all of these ancillary services in there? I would assume there's some sort of variable comp or incentive to do so. Could you talk about that?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Sure, David. I mean, it depends on segments. So when you're dealing with our SQ team, let's say that they're selling Steri-Safe, they are compensated, obviously, it is a base salary, but the variable comp would be in relationship to the upsell opportunity, the selling of the Steri-Safe contract. It gets a little bit more complex when you're dealing with our LQ accounts. We have reps that manage their relationship with a hospital. Their job is to manage that renewal process of all our existing services in that hospital, but at the same time, we want them to introduce new services into hospitals. So their compensation is not only based upon renewals of contracts but rolling that relationship with additional services. In selling those additional services, we have sales solutions executives that know those products. And obviously, they're compensated on getting the sale. So they'd have a base salary and their variable comp would be associated with the new sale, let's say Sharps Management or Pharmaceutical Waste. So it really depends whether you're talking about an SQ or LQ, but there are many different components. But yes, certainly, they're compensated. A big part of their compensation is the additional services to the existing customer base.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Barbara Noverini with MorningStar.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "So thinking about StrongPak. I understand that as the newer business margins remain below corporate average, which explains the gross margin drag in the quarter. However, as the business matures, what's your expectation for the margin profile? If it's skewing towards SQ, can this segment achieve similar margins to SQ domestic regulated waste?", "Charles A. Alutto", "I think, Barb, certainly, the operational efficiencies are on track. We're building that route density, but it's not just route density, it's making sure that we have the capability of our transportation network, where the waste is flowing to, those all add into growing margins. But your question around can we get to SQ margins, I think, it's too early to make that assumption. We certainly will -- we're already higher than our LQ margins. And we'll see if there's additional services that we can add to that StrongPak service more on compliance solutions but it is possible to get it to SQ-like margins. Right now, though, I think, it's too early to say that we'll get -- whether we can get or not get to SQ margins.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Sure. That's helpful. Also was there anything atypical about StrongPak's growth in the quarter? Maybe a large project or is it more a function of it just an expanding recurring customer base there?", "Charles A. Alutto", "So it's expanding. And obviously, they're also signing up some new ones.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And just lastly, when you have a tough winter like we've experienced in the current quarter, what sorts of disruptions do you see in your operations? Is it likely that we're going to see some margin pressure next quarter as a result or was it largely immaterial?", "Charles A. Alutto", "We didn't have an impact in Q4. Historically, we've managed it. And it's been immaterial. If it's anything, it's a slightly higher cost, it's not really impacting revenues as much but it could be if there's a little bit more overtime for people getting back to the shop, et cetera.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Sean Dodge with Jefferies.", "Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Development work on the patient communication platform nears completion, how should we expect that to impact the income statement? Is it going to drive more of an inflection in sales? Are you able to make a more considered push marketing a complete platform to clients or is it going to be more of a benefit to margin because you're able to pull back on some of the development spending or kind of all of the above?", "Charles A. Alutto", "I think, all of the above. First of all, I think, it will be a continuous process, we're always going to look to upgrade our systems. I mean, obviously, we're starting from ground 0 right now, we're buying a lot of small mom and pops. As I mentioned before, we're making significant progress on the operational infrastructure. We continue as we acquire places to upgrade the hardware and the backup systems. But I think, Sean, we can do that. So what does that mean? It means more reliability and a better service for our customers, that would help us on the retention end, certainly helps us on the growth of the business. And from a margin perspective, when you're providing service where we can do backups, it certainly helps you on the overall gross margin of the business, especially if you're able to integrate future acquisitions in a more timely basis.", "Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then, we covered the buildup of your internal growth guidance for the domestic segment. I'm curious how that looks for the international. So the 5% to 8% you're guiding for international growth in the international business, how much of that is price volume versus the ancillary services?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "I think, it's probably not much different from the LQ. It's about 10% to 20% on price, maybe a little bit more on volume. A little bit more on the volume side. And then, the rest is again the newer services.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Jason Rogers with Great Lakes Review.", "Jason Rogers", "Looking at 2013, would you provide a figure for the recall business for the year?", "Charles A. Alutto", "No, we don't break it out. I mean, there's [indiscernible] revenue.", "Jason Rogers", "Yes, revenue.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Revenue for RMS for the year came in at $97.8 million.", "Jason Rogers", "All right. And looking at 2013 again full year, would you provide an internal growth figure for the company, as well as domestic and international?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "The internal growth figure for the year? Yes, so for SQ was north of 8%, LQ was north of 6% for the year. And then, international was almost 7%. And total is 7.3%.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Excluding RMS.", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes, that excludes RMS.", "Jason Rogers", "Okay. And then, looking at accounts receivables up year-over-year, was that due mainly to the acquisitions?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "That was a big contributor there. The acquisitions was about $19.9 million of the increase. You had a little bit of currency translation in it. And then, the DSO itself was a contributor to it also.", "Jason Rogers", "And then, finally, would you be willing to provide an estimate for interest expense for 2014?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "I mean, for '14, you're going to be somewhere in probably 53.5 to 54.5.", "Operator", "Your next question is from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.", "James Francescone - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "This is actually James in for David. First, one follow-up on the situation at North Salt Lake. Between the original admissions test that caused the NOV to be issued and your subsequent response to the regulators following retesting, did you make any process changes or remediation to the facility that is -- did you identify any issues that you then proceeded to fix or was it simply that a new test came up with different results than the first test?", "Richard T. Kogler", "Well, as I said, we're in the middle of a process here, so I'm probably not comfortable getting into all kinds of details and what have you. I can tell you that we're upgrading that facility like we're upgrading all the other plants because of the new regulations that the federal government has put in place this year.", "Charles A. Alutto", "We continue -- Jim, we continue with all of our incinerators to do upgrades throughout the year and we've been doing that for several years. And that's not related to North Salt Lake. It's just in general what the new regulations are for the Clean Air Act.", "James Francescone - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "All right. Got it. And then, any color on SG&A expectations for the full year? Obviously, 2013 ended up 30 to 40 bps higher than 2012. Should we expect that level of reinvestment into '14 as well?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes. So we ended the fourth quarter at about 19.35%. The guidance is about 19.3% for the year of '14. It will start out a little bit higher and then sloping down slightly during the quarters and the year.", "James Francescone - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "That's helpful. And then, just finally, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that, obviously, there's been some adverse weather in the first quarter. Any implications to the P&L as we look into 1Q '14?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "No. We had no impact in Q4.", "James Francescone - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "On Q1, sorry.", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Again, we don't -- it's part of our guidance. It's all in there for the year. So it's too early to say. But again, historically, we've managed it, as I said, and it's been immaterial.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Richard Close with Avondale Partners.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "With respect to the add backs, Frank, can you give us a little bit of help in terms of how we should think about the add backs in 2014?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Define for me add backs.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "I mean, the difference when you have GAAP earnings and non-GAAP adjusted, just as we think about adjustments going throughout the year.", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "I think, the 2 main lines that obviously continue always for us is the acquisition expense and the integration expense. And then depending on what is being integrated, for instance, you may have a plant closure. So in Q4, there were some charges for plant closures because of our integration, we didn't need the facility anymore, it gets closed and there's some noncash writeups that may go with that. In a business where you do a lot of integration, that will happen. But that will go happen -- could happen at this point in our plant but it could happen, depending again on acquisitions. But the 2 line that will be consistent will be acquisition expense and integration expense.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then, as we're looking at the fourth quarter, just looking at the dollar amounts you have there for acquisition integration, the change in fair value, restructuring, plant closure, et cetera, what tax rate are you applying to those to get back to your $0.07 and $0.03, et cetera?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes. The overall tax rate is slightly lower. Some things are not tax deductible maybe in those items but it's not far removed, maybe slightly lower as to its tax deductibility but it's not that material.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then, just thinking about you had $0.01 on the litigation settlement but you're not showing any dollar amount on the P&L.", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "No, it is part of the -- it is mentioned on the P&L, it was about $2.1 million that was in the line of cost.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Yes, I see it there. With respect to the Utah. I don't want to ask too many more questions on this because we seem to have focused a lot on it here on the call. But do you have any ability if let's say you do shift volume to other incinerators, if they're far away from, I guess, the existing incinerator, are you able to adjust price accordingly or how does that work?", "Richard T. Kogler", "As I mentioned before, we routinely do this as a matter of operational course. I mean, it's -- so I think, you've looked at our historical trends, and obviously, our contracts allow us to move waste around and customers are fine with that. It really doesn't have any material impact on the company's financials when we do it because, again, we do it as a matter of course every quarter.", "Richard C. Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. But let's say I'm a physician or a hospital that's located close to Salt Lake City. All of a sudden, that plant is not open. You're not able to go back and charge them more money when their contract maybe comes up?", "Charles A. Alutto", "I think, you have to put this in perspective, though, Rich. First of all, a physician's practice would normally have waste that has to be incinerable. Let's remind everybody of what types of waste have to be incinerated. It's those types of -- it's medical waste, it's not limited to this, but it includes pathological waste, trace chemotherapeutic waste and nonhazardous pharmaceutical waste. These are required to be incinerated in some states. So on the example on a physician, that waste really doesn't -- that can't be sent to an alternative treatment facility. Even in the case of a hospital, only a small portion of their waste, less than 10% of their volume has to be incinerated. So right there, when you're looking at what kind of additional cost you have, it's over a small part of the overall waste stream. And then, it really depends on the contract that we have in place with that customer with respect what kind of passthrough opportunities we have.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Kevin Steinke with Barrington Research.", "Kevin M. Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Just wondering, in the international business, you talked about continuing to roll out Clinical Services. I was wondering if you're making progress or looking at rolling out some of the other ancillary services internationally as well?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. As I talked about before, we're making really good progress. I think, the progress is on track. Just to reeducate everybody on Clinical Services, which is the Steri-Safe equivalent in the international markets, we're currently in Canada, Ireland, in the U.K. and Portugal. The latest country that we started to pilot and started to have good traction is in Spain. With other additional services, when we look at our Sharps Management service, that is in Canada, Ireland, and we recently rolled out in the U.K. And then, when you look at our recall strategy, obviously, the acquisition in Europe in the second quarter of 2013 gave us an opportunity to start rolling out those recall type services into the European market. We're always looking at adding additional services. There's a lot of work going on in-country. Some of it again, we talked about some services that are country specific. We feel really good. I think, we're on track with the additional services on the international front.", "Kevin M. Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And how are price escalators on the contracts in Europe trending?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "I think, overall, obviously, with some of the very large contracts that we have like the national health systems, there's a little bit more linkage at times with consumer price indexes and the like. But we're very pleased with the '13 growth rate that we've had internationally. It's been the highest now in the past 3 years. So I think, the team is doing a good job.", "Operator", "And that does bring us to the end of today's Q&A session. I will turn the call back over to our presenters.", "Dan Ginnetti", "Thanks, Rachel. Well, we appreciate everyone taking time to participate in today's call. On a snowy and cold day in Chicago, I'll leave you with one warm thought. Pitchers and catchers start reporting to spring training tomorrow, which means that spring is not that far away.

My name is Lorra, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Stericycle First Quarter Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions). Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Dan Ginnetti, VP of Finance. Please go ahead, sir.", "Dan Ginnetti", "Thank you, Lorra. Welcome to Stericycle's quarterly conference call. Joining me on today's call will be Frank Ten Brink, CFO; Rich Kogler, COO; and Charlie Alutto, CEO.", "I will now read the Safe Harbor statement. Statements by Stericycle in this conference call that are not strictly historical are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and should be viewed with caution.

", "Frank Ten Brink", "Thank you. The results for the first quarter are as follows: Revenues were $570 million, up 10.9% from $513.8 million in Q1, 2013. And internal growth, excluding returns and recall revenues was up 6.3%. Domestic revenues were $392.1 million of which $369 million was domestic regulated waste and compliance services and $23.1 million was recalls and returns.", "Domestic internal growth, excluding recalls and returns revenues was up 6.4% consisting of SQ up 8% and LQ up 5%. International revenues were $177.9 million. And internal growth adjusted for unfavorable exchange impact of $8.1 million was up 6%.", "Acquisitions contributed $32.9 million to the growth in the quarter. Gross profit was $255.5 million or 44.8% of revenues. SG&A expense including amortization was $110.8 million or 19.4% of revenues. Net interest expense was $14.9 million. And net income attributable to Stericycle was $79.1 million or $0.91 per share on an as-reported basis and $1.04 adjusted for acquisition and other non-recurring expenses.", "Now the balance sheet. Our covenant debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.0 at the end of the quarter. And the unused portion of our revolver debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $631 million. In the quarter, we repurchased 685,990 shares of common stock on the open market in an amount of $78.3 million. The Board has authorized the purchase of an additional 4.1 million shares and now at the end of the quarter we have authorization to purchase 5.7 million shares. Capital spend was $16.4 million in the quarter. The DSO was 62 days. And Q1 as reported cash from operations was $144.5 million and when adjusted for recall reimbursements discussed last call [and one-timer] [ph] cash from operations was $156.9 million.", "And now I will turn it over to Rich. ", "Rich Kogler", "Thanks, Frank. In the quarter, we closed five transactions, two domestic and three international. The international acquisitions were in Portugal. Revenues from the five acquisitions were immaterial in the quarter and annualized are approximately $14.6 million.", "As announced on April 22, we completed the acquisition of the PSC Environmental services division which is expected to add approximately $165 million in revenue for the remainder of this year and annualized revenues are $240 million. The transaction is accretive to EPS this year. When combined with our existing business, we initially anticipate an unfavorable impact to our gross margin of 240 to 245 basis points on our full quarter basis. As synergies are realized over the next 12 months, our company gross margin will improve. We are very excited about this acquisition because it expands our operational infrastructure, increases our geographic reach, improves route and long haul efficiencies and reduces disposal costs. This transaction enhances our existing platform and increases profitability and revenue growth in both our healthcare and StrongPak retail service offerings. ", "Following the completion of the PSC deal, our worldwide acquisition pool still remains robust with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business. Looking ahead we remain excited about our expanding growth opportunities, our global acquisition strategy increases our customer base, providing long-term growth platform for selling multiple services such as compliance solutions, StrongPak, Sharps Management and pharma waste. ", "And as customers adopt our multiple services they can more than triple the revenue. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 569,000 accounts, of which approximately 549,000 were small, the remainder large. ", "In closing, we want to welcome the over 1100 PSC team members that are joining this Stericycle family and of course we want to thank each member of our worldwide team for their strong performance and continued commitment to our customers, our shareholders and our value. ", "And I'll turn it over to Charlie. ", "Charles Alutto", "Thank you, Rich. I would now like to provide insights on our current guidance for 2014. Please keep in mind that these are forward looking statements and our guidance does not include future acquisition, divestures, integration, acquisition related and other non-recurring expenses. For 2014, we believe analysts' EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.22 to $4.26. This includes approximately $0.03 to $0.04 contribution from PSC Environmental mostly in the back half of the year. ", "We believe the analysts' revenue estimates for 2014 will be in the range of $2.51 billion to $2.53 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange rates. This includes $165 million contribution from PSC Environmental. We anticipate 2014 internal growth rate to be SQ, 8% to 10%; LQ, 5% to 8%; international, 5% to 8%; and recall and returns revenues between $100 million to $115 million. With the addition of PSC Environmental, we expect our gross margins to be unfavorably impacted by 240 to 245 basis points on a full quarter basis. The impact in Q2 will be approximately 200 basis points due to the timing of the closing. Q3 impact will be 240 to 245 basis points and then improving sequentially thereafter as synergies are realized. ", "We believe analysts will have estimates for 2014 free cash flow between $410 million to $417 million. 2014 CapEx is anticipated to be between $76 million to $80 million. Due to the impact of the one time tax adjustments in Q1, we expect the full year as reported tax rate to be 34.5%. This assumes the tax rate in each of the remaining quarters to be approximately 35.5%.", "In closing, we are very pleased with our first quarter 2014 results and remain excited about our multiple growth opportunities for 2014 and beyond. ", "Thank you for your time today. We'll now answer any questions. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up question as necessary. Lorra, you can now open the Q&A queue. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions).", "Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels from William Blair. Your line is open. ", "Nick Hiller - William Blair & Company", "Hi, this is Nick Hiller in for Ryan Daniels. Thanks for taking my question. So can you just walk us through the logic on the PSC Environmental deal a bit meaning why now and what are some of the costs saving and logistics advantages you get with the assets and who are the main clients et cetera?", "Charles Alutto", "Sure on the why now question, Nick, with our growth in StrongPak and other healthcare haz waste PSC was a very good fit right now, perfect match given their geographical reach and operational infrastructure. Obviously, on the synergy side, it is an area that we have really good experience and that will be a long haul efficiencies, our route density and our disposable cost, and in the end the compliance team has great depth of experience in all aspects of the hazardous waste business so I think the timing was perfect for us and we really feel that PSC was a perfect match for Stericycle.", "Nick Hiller - William Blair & Company", "Okay, and on PSC I think about 80% of business is kind of recurring in nature, what about the other 20%? I realize overall it will be a small percent of corporate revenues but what would cause ebbs and flows there? ", "", "Charles Alutto", "Yes, those are more contracts or project based but they had very good revenue coming from reoccurring customers that come back to them, so even though they are not under reoccurring long-term contracts, they have a very good repeat business from customers. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Hi, guys and congratulation on the quarter and the acquisition. I'll ask about the acquisition as well, but you had obviously significantly lower margins in the core business. And I guess can you talk through if this is really just a lack of revenue scale over the infrastructure or there are different operating cost, competitive dynamic or pricing or other things about this market opportunity that would be it a longer term, be it structurally lower margin than the core medical waste business. ", "Frank Ten Brink", "Yes, so today this is a lower margin business for Stericycle but the combination will improve these margins through synergies and with the growth in margin will improve significantly over time when these synergies are realized and also part of that as you said is the utilization of the capacity that they have in their infrastructure. And we are not focused solely on the margin percentage as we said the criteria to do this deal was it was a very good strategic fit, it was a very good longer-term ROIC and IRR in the transaction and gives us great growth opportunities and support in the growth in StrongPak. ", "Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Okay, and then just following up on that the $240 million of revenue, is that largely in the haz waste area and I guess, I don't know what StrongPak was doing but let\u2019s say $50 million to $100 million all of a sudden that would seem to indicate 30% to 35% market share of that opportunity, is that right or if not what other elements should I think about? ", "Rich Kogler", "You are partially right, Gary. The $240 million is an SQ hazardous waste but it is not solely in the retail haz waste. So if you think about their business they have small quantities of hazardous waste, they augmented an on-site services compliance program, sustainability offerings and if you think of the different industry they go beyond the retail space. They are in things like life sciences, education, manufacturing and even within the retail space there are some segments of that we didn't previously service like home improvement centers. And I think the other thing to think about when we were talking about the StrongPak opportunity of a billion we were looking specifically at the retail haz base, I think conservatively to think now of this new service area and focus you can certainly double that market. But again we are focused on the SQ haz waste market.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Flavio Campos - Credit Suisse AG", "Hi, this is Flavio Campos. I'm standing in for Hamzah today. Just a quick question not directly on PSC. But when you're looking at this asset, did you also look at other assets on the market such as the EQ biometric quality company that ECOL just bought? And what made you decide to go for PSC over other assets such as like that one?", "", "Rich Kogler", "Yes, I think if you look at that certainly we looked at all options right. We have build versus buy options in the market place. But when we looked at other assets we really looked at the geographic reach and operational infrastructure of PSC and that's why we thought it was a perfect fit for us. If you think about the fact that they have 12 [PSC] [ph] facility where we had one and they have 22, 10 day location to our 18, it really was a good fit for our service offering in healthcare haz and the StrongPak business. ", "Flavio Campos - Credit Suisse AG", "Perfect, that's helpful. And just looking into like the base businesses since you guys posted some pretty good growth this quarter, you have historically said about 50% of your growth comes from price and volume and the rest from ancillary services, which of the ancillary services are the ones that growing faster right now and that you guys expect to grow faster in the future? ", "Charles Alutto", "Yes, I think we talked about where the breakdown is, if you remember SQ is about 8% to 10% internal organic growth, about 40% to 50% of that is price and volume, the addition - the additional comes from additional services so the remainder comes from additional services and SQ that's historically Steri-Safe and StrongPak services. On LQ, the growth rate is 5% to 8%. Only about 10% to 20% comes from price and volume, the remainder comes from additional services like Rx Waste, Sharps Management and some StrongPak in there as well. ", "Flavio Campos - Credit Suisse AG", "Perfect, perfect, that's very helpful. And just a question, just a final question on the margin profile; you guys have touch on this a lot on the acquisition side already. But some of the ancillary services also have -- the additional services also have lower margin profile, you think that like with acquisition like PSC and the growth in the services side, does that put like long term margins, put some pressure on long-term margin profile or you guys are confident that through synergies you can keep current margins? ", "Frank Ten Brink", "So in the next quarter we will see a drop because of the inclusion now PSC has Charlie said and in Q3 is going to be a full quarter but then you will see the improvement with the synergies really kicking in. So as Charlie kind of said what those rates were. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc.", "Good afternoon, guys. May be we can talk about 90% of the business that you own, can you give us a little bit of an update on how that performed in the quarter and in particular maybe address a little of the margin. I guess the gross margin may have been impacted by transaction cost but could you just help me through that?", "Frank Ten Brink", "Yes, so the gross margin if you look at last quarter which had the one time of the settlement and if you adjust for that you are at about 45% margin. So this quarter if you look at Q4 to Q1, the Q4 acquisition had about 10 bps negative impact, weather probably about 20 bps, foreign exchange was about 4 bps improvement and then the general business - those factors improved by about 11 bps to about then 44.8% for this quarter. ", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc.", "Okay. Help us understand I guess may be it is to what extent this customer overlap already existing businesses, is there any attrition here or business that you need to give up or I know it is gotten to the regulatory clearance et cetera but I mean just help a little bit understand, is all of this I will say new growth new customer base et cetera? ", "Charles Alutto", "Yes, I mean it is all new customer base for the most part I think when you think about their service and our service; we compliment each other very well. Both of us obviously are in this retail haz waste base, they had little bit in healthcare hazardous waste out but not much. But then have a lot of different small quantity customers, again I touched on manufacturing and life science, education, and I think at the end of the day is really their infrastructure which is a great match given that geographical reach we wanted, it gave us the TSDFs in a 10 days, so from service standpoint not a lot of overlap there, customers not really any. So that's really more operational if it fit our business and I think it is a really good platform to grow the business for many years to come. ", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc.", "Have they said how many customers they have? ", "Frank Ten Brink", "We did not just give that information, that's what we are working on. That's obviously thousands of locations that they service but next quarter you will see that included in our customer account.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Thanks, hey, guys. Following up on the margin in the quarter, you just mentioned weather was a negative 20 bps sequentially. Could you give a taste for how much of an impact that was year-over-year? It doesn't seem too meaningful and I wouldn't think it would be very meaningful in your business but just some more positioning around that. Thanks.", "Rich Kogler", "I think historically we have always had some weather impact and we managed it and it is been immaterial. And this year it was obviously more severe because how often does Atlanta get shutdown for two days. But as Frank said the impact was about 20 bps in the quarter. ", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.", "All right, thanks. I want to throw in on the tax rate -- thanks for the guidance for the remainder of the year. Could you speak a little bit about what was occurring in the first quarter and changes going forward? Thanks.", "Frank Ten Brink", "Yes, we had a situation where we had the tax deductibility of goodwill that was now achievable in Brazil on some acquisition that we have done where we became 100% owner and because of that it became deductible. And so that's one time entry and this lowers our cash tax obviously in future shares which are a great cash contribution in the future. ", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Okay, thanks. That's my two. I'll come back later. Thanks. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead. ", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "", "Thank you very much for taking my questions. I just want to get to the core business a little bit. If you look at what seems to be the regulated medical waste domestically, it looks like there was less than $1 million organic growth on a sequential basis. I have to go back about 10 years to see that small amount of sequential growth. Am I looking at something wrong? Or were you guys preoccupied with the business and the acquisition or how should I think of that?", "Charles Alutto", "So the overall growth rate were right in our range and so it was impacted a little bit by the weather as we said that having carry through the gross margin. It can vary Q-to-Q, the comparative a little bit versus a prior period but overall if there growth rate were right in the picture.", "Rich Kogler", "Probably it is domestically, Shlomo, somewhat were very similar Q3, 2013 ", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.", "You see what I am pointing at there on the sequential basis, up like 800,000? I would have thought just on the natural growth of your business would have been a little bigger than that.", "Charles Alutto", "Yes, it is also a little bit may be timing acquisition were not contributing in the quarter that were closed in the quarter. So have a little bit of that factor that can play in on the total number. ", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Okay and can you just talk a little bit about the free cash flow potential of this business that you are buying when you get to the synergies kicking in more. You have raised the free cash flow guidance up like $7 million to $8 million? Given the size of this acquisition, I would think that there's a lot more to go when it is fully integrated. Can you give us some kind of outlook on that?", "Frank Ten Brink", "Yes, if you kind of look at on similar basis, a fully synergized with really no growth included yet which obviously there will be, you are looking at free cash flow of somewhere $17 to $18 million which we think is conservative but as you know we are conservative when we get these initial numbers. Capital spend on that business is not similar from what we are running in an overall business right around that 3.5% is what they have been running, and I think the combination we can get better capital utilization there and capacity utilization out of that. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. In fact it is actually Joel in for Issac. Just on the base business, can you provide us an update on the margin expansion initiative outside U.S. how those are tracking may be focusing particularly on Spain and Japan? ", "Charles Alutto", "Yes, I think we talked about our international margin expansion. Depends on which country obviously some countries we have done a lot of acquisition and we are still looking to build the SQ base and asked about selling additional services. I think specifically the Spain, we followed up with several SQ acquisitions, we talked about rolling out clinical services so we are still in the power space for rolling out that clinical services which is equivalent Steri-Safe in Spain. And I think everything is on track with respect to Spain. And I think the other question you have with Japan. As you know, we are in the northern island of Hokkaido. That's really great improvements with some integration work they have done over the last 18 to 24 months. We feel really comfortable with that market and feel like we are on track in Japan as well. ", "Unidentified Analyst", "And then just another one on PSC. Can you just touch on the revenue synergies that acquisition provide and then to what extent that those factored into your return map for the deal?", "Charles Alutto", "Yes, I think it is really, if you think about this infrastructure that came with the transaction and obviously a great team on the sales and operations side that's not combined with ours. There is a really good platform to continue to support the growth in StrongPak, they obviously had things going that they were going after that looks good and is growing for them. It has been a business; it has been growing over the years so again we look forward to good results from them going forward as combo with us. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Manthey with Robert W. Baird & Co. Please go ahead. ", "David Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc", "", "Hi, good afternoon. On this income tax adjustment in the first quarter, could you tell me what was that benefit in dollar terms? And second, you exclude a lot of things here to arrive at non-GAAP EPS, why wouldn't you exclude that?", "Frank Ten Brink", "So you can exclude, it was about $4.3 million or about $0.05 a share, so I could say it depends again on what the rates are that the different analysts have in their model as to a tax rate because that's what you really then comparing to. But it was about $4.3 million. ", "David Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc", "And then in terms of the four items that you did exclude that you typically do, can you give us what the net income dollar values are, just give us a little more precision on that? And if you want to just put them on a bucket, that's fine. But I just want a net income dollar number that I can compare rather than EPS.", "Frank Ten Brink", "Let me follow up on that. I don't have it right in front of me but I will follow up with you on that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Greg Halter with Great Lakes Review. Your line is open. ", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review/Wellington Shields ", "Thank you and good afternoon. On the five deals that were announced, can you discuss what type those were?", "Frank Ten Brink", "Yes, they were four regulated waste transaction and one communication solutions transaction.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review/Wellington Shields ", "And by location? ", "Frank Ten Brink", "By location, there were three in Portugal, those were the three international and the other ones were in the United States ", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review/Wellington Shields ", "And in Portugal, were all RMWs?", "Frank Ten Brink", " ", "Yes, those were all RMWs.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review/Wellington Shields ", "Right, and on the fuel cost side I just wondered if you could comment about that and what you see with prices going up again, even though -- ", "Charles Alutto", "I think change was about 5.6% of what we call total energy, that's fuel and energy and remember that's calculated only on the sectors where that applies to.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Francescone with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ", "James Francescone - Morgan Stanley", "Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Do you expect that having just done a relatively larger deal that your appetite or the pace of acquisitions going forward will change at all?", "Charles Alutto", "No, I don't think so. Our leverage on a pro forma basis is going to be at about 2.3, 2.4 compared to the two so we still have ample room and obviously the free cash flow that gets generated in the business supports also our acquisition. Our line has substantial usage still available underneath it. And again as Rich said we are well over $100 million still in annualized revenue of people who have discussions with. ", "James Francescone - Morgan Stanley", "But looking at that from maybe a slightly different angle, do you have any constraints on your ability to integrate deals of this size?", "Charles Alutto", "It happened in the past I mean if you think about it this one transaction makes it almost a little easier because we already has the team working very well together pre the deal was closed to work on what were the synergies when the deal closed everyone has their seat already assigned to them so they are well underway to make it work and so that team is right dedicated to it but that team doesn't get as much involved necessarily in the subsequent deals. The synergies that we are getting out at the PSC deal, they relate to long haul, route density, and disposal cost very much in the areas that we are very familiar with. So no I don't think the team is going to hold back and doing more stuff and it is from a total company point of view we are obviously doing it internationally, and in the different areas of our business. ", "James Francescone - Morgan Stanley", "And then if I could sneak in just one more financial one, do you have a sense of what the incremental amortization expense particularly from that deal is going to be?", "Charles Alutto", "We are still working at that but the estimate is roughly for D&A to be about $15 million and $15.5 million of which about $10 million is depreciation but that's still being worked on because that's all the purchase price allocations and things. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Steinke with Barrington Research. Your line is open. ", "Kevin Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc", "", "Good afternoon. Just wondering what we should expect for SG&A as a percent of revenue for the remainder of the year.", "Frank Ten Brink", "Yes, Kevin, the PSC impact there is favorable so we have given before for the year to be about 19.3%, now it is closer to the 19%. So that is a good number for a year.", "Kevin Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc", "Okay, and I wanted to ask about Communication Solutions, what you are seeing on the organic sales front there. I think you talked about training your sales force last quarter on Communication Solutions.", "Charles Alutto", "", "Yes, Kevin, as we spoke in last quarter we just finished our national sales meeting, we spent a lot of time of that meeting focused on Communication Solutions and training our existing sales team on their capabilities in that area. Obviously, the long term goal is to start to working with our SQ and LQ sales team and leverage that relationship and out of that of meeting we are currently building our very strong sales pipeline which we feel will work that business ongoing in the future so I think we are on track there. Now the team is really hit the ground and running from our national sales meeting and now the pipeline is strong. ", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to Charlie Alutto.", "Charles Alutto", "Thanks, Lorra. We appreciate everyone taking time to participate in today's call. We look forward to seeing some of you on the road in next couple of months. Have a great night. Take care.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Stericycle second quarter earnings call. [Operator Instructions]", "Frank Ten Brink, CFO, you may now begin your conference.", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Thank you. Welcome to Stericycle's quarterly conference call. Joining me on today's call will be Rich Kogler, COO; Dan Ginnetti, CFO-elect; and Charlie Alutto, CEO.", "I will now read the Safe Harbor statement. Statements by Stericycle in this conference call that are not strictly historical are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and should be viewed with caution. Factors described in the company's 10-K, 10-Q, as well as its other filings with the SEC, could affect the company's actual results and could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from expected results. The company makes no commitment to disclose any revisions to forward-looking statements or any facts, events or circumstances after this date that may bear upon the forward-looking statements.", "I will now turn it over to Dan.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti", "Thank you, Frank. The results for the second quarter are as follows. Revenues were $640.8 million, up 21.7% from $526.5 million in Q2 2013, and internal growth, excluding returns and recall revenues, was up 7.2%. Domestic revenues were $454.5 million, of which $429.8 million was domestic-regulated waste and compliance services and $24.7 million was recalls and returns. Domestic internal growth, excluding recalls and returns revenues, was up 8.3%, consisting of SQ, up 9%; and LQ, up 7%.", "International revenues were $186.3 million, and internal growth, adjusted for unfavorable exchange impact of $4.4 million, was up 5%. Acquisitions contributed $81.7 million to the growth in the quarter. Gross profit was $275.3 million or 43% of revenues. SG&A expense, including amortization, was $121.7 million or 19% of revenues. Net interest expense was $16.4 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $81.9 million or $0.95 per share on an as-reported basis and $1.03 adjusted for acquisitions and other nonrecurring expenses.", "Now for the balance sheet. Our covenant debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.38 at the end of the quarter. In the quarter, we increased our revolver line of credit from $1 billion to $1.2 billion. The new revolver will mature on June of 2019. The unused portion of the new revolver at the end of the quarter was approximately $512 million.", "In the quarter, we repurchased 527,243 shares of common stock on the open market in the amount of $58.8 million. At the end of the quarter, we have authorization to purchase 5.2 million shares. Our CapEx was $27.2 million [ph], slightly higher in this quarter due to the timing of planned upgrades. Our DSO was 62 days. Year-to-date, as-reported cash from operations was $238.3 million. When adjusted for recall reimbursement onetimers, from -- cash and operations was $262.1 million.", "I will now turn it over to Rich.", "Richard T. Kogler", "Thank you, Dan. In the quarter, we closed 13 transactions, 3 domestic and 10 international. This excludes the previously announced PSC transaction. The international acquisitions were 2 in Romania, 2 in Chile, 1 in Portugal, 1 in Brazil, 1 in Spain, 1 in Canada, 1 in the U.K. and 1 in South Korea, which represents a new market for us. Revenues from the 13 acquisitions were $5.3 million in the quarter and annualized are approximately $39 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust, with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business.", "I'm pleased to report that our previously announced acquisition of PSC Environmental Services division is performing well, and our integration plan is on track. As expected in Q2, the PSC acquisition unfavorably impacted gross margins by approximately 200 basis points. Per our previous guidance, gross margins in Q3, which is our first full quarter of this acquisition, will be impacted by an additional 40 to 45 basis points. Thereafter, gross margins will improve as synergies are realized.", "Looking ahead, we remain excited about our expanding growth opportunities. Our global acquisition strategy increases our customer base, providing a long-term growth platform for selling multiple services, such as compliance solutions, StrongPak, Sharps Management and pharma waste. As customers adopt our multiple services, it can more than triple their revenues. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 594,300 accounts, of which approximately 573,600 were small, the remainder were large.", "In closing, we want to welcome our new team members in South Korea, and we want to thank each member of our worldwide team for their strong performance and continued commitment to our customers, our shareholders and our values.", "I'll now turn it over to Charlie.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Thanks, Rich. I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2014. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration, acquisition-related and other nonrecurring expenses.", "For 2014, we believe analysts' EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.24 to $4.27. We believe analysts' revenue estimates for 2014 will be in the range of $2.54 billion to $2.57 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and foreign exchange rates. We anticipate 2014 internal growth rates to be SQ, 8% to 10%; LQ, 5% to 8%; international, 5% to 8%; and recall and returns revenues between $100 million and $110 million.", "We believe analysts will have estimates for 2014 free cash flow between $410 million to $417 million. 2014 CapEx is anticipated to be between $80 million to $84 million. We expect the full year as-reported tax rate to be 34.5%. This assumes a tax rate for the remainder of the year to be approximately 35%.", "In closing, we are very pleased with our second quarter 2014 results and remain excited about our multiple growth opportunities for 2014 and beyond. Thank you for your time today.", "We'll now answer any questions. [Operator Instructions] Ian, you can now open the queue.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line from Ryan Daniels from William Blair.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "I guess, I want to hit on the PSC integration efforts. Maybe you can talk a little bit more deeply about the team that's involved there, maybe what their key goals are near term, what early feedback has been from your and their clients. And then it sounds like the synergies are on plan. So talk a little bit about that.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. If you remember, Ryan, let's go back. We talked about the synergies in this deal were mainly in 3 areas. It was in long haul, route density and disposal costs. We also talked about the fact that leading up to the closing during the -- waiting for the approval, we did get the teams together, especially on the IT side, and looked at our waste profiles and how can we get that -- those waste profiles into the PSC system. The systems are compatible. The good news is we've started to divert waste into our new structure, as well as we begin -- we began various integration efforts in things like sales, IT, finance, compliance and operations. So all in all, the integration is certainly on track, and we're tracking to those integration accretion numbers we've talked about on the previous call.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay, perfect. And maybe one for Dan. Given the noise with PSC acquisition and just everything else, can you give the gross margin bridge that you often provide to us so we can understand the core ins and outs there?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti", "Yes. Thank you for that. The -- so coming off of Q1, we're at 44.82%. As expected, PSC impacted our gross margins unfavorably by about 202 basis points. The other acquisitions within the quarter further impacted it about 13 basis points. We had a small impact from foreign exchange of about 4 basis points. And then our improvement from both the normal course of business and recovery from the weather impact of Q1 was about 33 basis points up. And that's how we bridge to the 42.96%.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk at Wedbush Securities.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "On the CapEx side, could you elaborate on maybe the changes or the investments that you're making there?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Sure. I think as we've talk about, it's really just the timing of projects, and the projects are primarily upgrading some of our autoclave plants and the required Title V compliance work that we needed to do this year for our incinerator plant facilities. That needs to be done and completed by October, so we've kind of moved everything up just to get it done ahead of time.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Have you -- are you running into any additional surprises or items of pleasant surprise as you're going through this analysis?", "Charles A. Alutto", "No. I mean, actually, we're glad to see the plants are moving ahead. We're sticking to our full year guidance of $80 million to $84 million, which is kind of in line with where we've seen the company run in the low-3s, 3.1% to 3.3%. And even if you just take Q1 and Q2 and put them together, we're at an average of 3.6%, which is identical to Q2 half year last year.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Is that -- I know we had a one limit, one follow-up. But still on that same topic, how does PSC impact CapEx plans going forward? I realize you're targeting this 3%, 3.5%.", "Charles A. Alutto", "PSC is in the same range, and it's included in the guidance we're giving you now for this year.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee at RBC Capital Markets.", "Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "If we are to take a long view, like, say, 5 years from now, how should we think about the puts and takes around what the PSC, StrongPak profitability can look like in the future relative to what you do in the core business? Is it safe to say that without the high-margin compliance part of the offering with medical waste that it's likely always going to be lower? And if so, any sense of how much? Or how do we think about that?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. We think -- well, first of all, we need to integrate the businesses because we're going to see improvements of margins as we integrate into their infrastructure. And again, the thought process we had on the deal was we liked where their cities are located. It strategically fit in to our business. Obviously, longer term, we think, margins will also improve significantly because [indiscernible] the facilities they had were underutilized. And even with our volumes going into their plants, there is still a lot of capacity available at their facilities. Longer term, do we think this could be very influential to our SQ transactional med waste business. There's a good possibly for that. It seems more like a challenge at this point, but there isn't, right now, a compliance component like Steri-Safe but that could change over time as well.", "Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then, the follow-up. Can we just get an update on how you're doing selling the SQ overseas and what market is that really working in? What are the -- maybe what are the gating factors to more quickly penetrating that? And I guess, along with that also, the compliance offerings that you've been selling overseas. I don't think we've got an update in a while in either of those.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. I think for SQ, you have -- I think on the SQ side, we've always been selling SQ type services when we go into a market. Generally, we enter a market traditionally by LQ type businesses and quickly follow-up with tuck-on acquisitions on the SQ side. So we've got SQ sales activity in virtually every market that we're in around the world. On the Clinical Services side, which I think was the second part of your question, if you take a look at Spain, which is our latest market entry, we've seen a really good adoption as we've launched Clinical Services into that specific geography. So I would say, on the international growth front, we're within our growth range. But we feel really good especially about international growth rates on the second half of the year.", "Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "But is the SQ still like a tiny percentage of mix overseas? I mean, I remember you saying it was like less than 1/4 relative to 2/3 in the U.S. Is it still that range? Or is that been improving or increasing in the last year or so?", "Charles A. Alutto", "It's been increasing. Of course, it varies country by country. The countries we've been in longer, the U.K. and Canada, has a bigger percentage than some of the newer market entries, like Spain and now South Korea.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum at Stifel.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Can you -- Charlie, can you talk a little bit about the communications business, what you're seeing in terms of underlying growth? And just when do you expect that the growth of that business organically will start to be a contributing factor? Or to say it a different way, at what point in time will you need that to start contributing in order to be able to maintain that 6% to 8% organic growth rate that you guys are targeting?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. First of all, it is contributing to growth right now. So we are seeing growth, and it's within the bandwidth of our overall company average growth. I think the one thing we talked about earlier in the year, Shlomo, is about how we wanted to leverage the Stericycle sales force. So I want to maybe give you a good example of a recent win we had on a very large East Coast health care system, where we had med waste relationship and servicing for med waste. We did a little physician referral services there, but we really leveraged the medical waste relationship. And we recently awarded a contract that included after-hour answering services, appointment reminders, call overflow for approximately 26 clinics and over 100 physicians. And there's even more opportunity to grow that over the time. So I think as we've always said, we really feel that we are able to leverage our relationship, and I'm glad to see very early on in the process, as we've educated and trained our Steri sales force, that we're starting to see some wins. So it certainly is in the growth rate, it is growing. We think, long term, that's a great opportunity for us.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then just this is a kind of a housekeeping item. Can you go over the free cash flow normalized and go over the puts and takes over there in the quarter?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes. I mean, free cash flow, we came in as reported $66.6 million and $194.7 million year-to-date. Keep in mind, we do an adjusted free cash flow on that. So we're going to -- we adjust for the repo reimbursement, which is about $4 million that's been out, so we're adding that back in. And then for some of the onetimers, about $7.3 million in the quarter. So if you adjust it, that's $77.8 million and $218.5 million for the year.", "Charles A. Alutto", "And Shlomo, remember, Q2 is normally a lower free cash flow quarter because it's the quarter we make 2 tax payments. The Q1 and Q2 tax payments are made into the Q2 time frame.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "I -- one thing I want to hit on is recall. It looked like a solid quarter, yet I think you took the high end of the guidance range down by $5 million. And that category is fairly bringing down revenue for many years. So I'm just curious. Is it just the environment? Is it you're spending less on marketing now and maybe allocating elsewhere? Just an update there, please.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. No, I mean, I think we've always described this business as having a certain amount of base organic growth that grows quite well. And then, we have sort of what we want to call those -- the blockbuster events or delivery events. And the only reason we slightly tweak guidance was because we didn't see any of those blockbuster events in the first 2 quarters. So we moved it down, the guidance down slightly than we anticipated. Hopefully, we don't want to in the back half of the year. But the regulatory environment continues to intensify out there, we continue to manage more and more events. And now our events are very well diversified among the different customer types, so we feel good about the business.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then I'll try on South Korea. It sounds like it's interesting. If you could please elaborate there.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Sure. Just a little some -- more information on South Korea. Obviously, 14th largest economy in the world. It's got a very strong regulatory and enforcement around regulated medical waste. It is a fragmented industry. So if you think about -- we talk about new countries that we want to go into, strong regulations, fragmented industry. Certainly, South Korea has both and as well as a sophisticated and an expanding health care market. And just to give some color around the market opportunity, we estimate the market opportunity being between $200 million and $250 million.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro at Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I want to ask another one about health care, specifically -- just in general, specifically with regards to health care reform, the ACA. It didn't sound like you're seeing a whole bunch of impact here from medical waste volumes tied to new coverage. But just curious if you had any updates on your plans in trying to get some of that business as it shows up and just your general views on how that'll pace in the back half of this year.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. I think we saw some good growth rates in the domestic business. I don't essentially tie that to the Affordable Care Act. I think, at this time, we see no material effect. I think, longer term, as we see more come into the ranks of insurance, we think that will grow, especially near the SQ space. We see it now on the retail clinics that are being built and run. We think there'll be opportunities for more of our services. I'd like to bring back to the Con Sol, when you see us sign a large East Coast health care system, specifically their clinics. As hospitals consolidate and start to branch out outside of the traditional 4 walls of large hospitals, those services specifically within Communication Solutions, play really well on that space, both after-hour answering, appointment reminders, call overflow. Those are traditionally services you would see in the SQ, but we're getting traction for them from our LQ customers as the lines blur between SQ and LQ in the U.S. health care market.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. Maybe a follow-up on that would be to your point on SQ. You obviously have a trend in the major retail pharmacies, where they are becoming more of these sort of mini clinics, if you will. I have to imagine that will create an opportunity for you guys to get closer to that channel. So be curious when you think that will be significant. How are you trying to pursue the opportunity?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. We still have -- we have some already today. As I said, that gives us an opportunity to get some hazard waste opportunities on StrongPak. We're starting to cross-sell the other way now where StrongPak is starting to get at the opportunity on medical waste coming from the retail side. It's a little bit too early. But I think when that segment grows, and it is growing, we're really in a great position to address that market, I think.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis at Morgan Stanley.", "James Francescone - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "This is actually James in for David. You did a nice job earlier of walking through the impact of PSC on the gross margin line. I was wondering if you can help us think through what the implications were for SG&A as well, which, obviously, had a nice tick down from the first quarter to second quarter. I mean, how much of that is organic improvement versus the impact of PSC? And how does PSC or any synergies you're expecting from there impact that line going forward?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "Yes. It's a great question, James. Thanks. In the quarter, PSC benefited our SG&A line by 25 basis points. And then, internally, we also improved about another 18 basis points and then you saw a little bit of improvement from partial quarter of some of the other acquisitions. And that's how we came in at 18.9%. Going forward, next quarter, I think you'll see about another 15 basis points improvement. We still believe that for the year, 19% SG&A is a good number.", "James Francescone - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then for the tax rate, we're still thinking 34.5%?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "For the year, 34.5%, yes, is a good tax rate. So that's going to put you in the second half somewhere in the 35% to 35.2% range.", "Operator", "And your last question comes from Sean Dodge, calling in from Morgan Stanley (sic) [Jefferies].", "Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "It's actually Jefferies. Charlie, we had talked previously about some changes you are testing to the Steri-Safe program here domestically, where you're going to be expanding your compliance offerings beyond just OSHA. So wondering if you could just flesh that out a bit for us. And what else is there compliance-wise you guys can help physicians with?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. Over the years, we've always looked to enhance the Steri-Safe offering. In recent years and really now, we have both HIPAA compliance program and hazardous waste disposal [ph]. Those are the ones that are part of the regulatory requirements for, especially, the SQ practitioners that just don't have the wherewithal and the expertise on their staff. We've been looking and have already launched an enhanced Steri-Safe offering. So we're looking at Steri-Safe as no longer just OSHA compliant. It's really safety and total compliance program for our customer base.", "Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay. I think I missed the last part, so this is something you've already rolled out here? And is it something you can charge a higher fee for?", "Charles A. Alutto", "We started to roll out, and there are some additional fees associated with the new program that we've got [ph] correct.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of David Manthey at Robert W. Baird.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Question on the Com Sols business. Could you give us an idea of, like, a Beryl Health or a NotifyMD, what are the average monthly revenues per customer or per doc that they're experiencing right now?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. Usually, we look at it, Dave, on a per-physician basis. And in general, when you look at after-hour answering service or appointment reminder, in general, anywhere between $90 to $100 per physician per month. But there are other charges in there depending on how many calls and how many minutes, time that we use. So that's really from a NotifyMD. On the physician referral line or post-discharge call for Beryl Health, it varies. It could be tens of thousands of dollars per hospital. But it really depends on which service offering they're taking. More of that is based on how many agents we're going to have on and how many minutes we might be on the phone. So that varies per hospital.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. So not too far off from your targeted ranges. When you said it's contributing to the overall growth of the company and then you mentioned that it's growing in line with the overall growth rate of the company, did I hear that right? It would seem that you'd be seeing better growth there off a smaller base? Or is that not right?", "Charles A. Alutto", "No. I think, if you think about that business, it's growing in the overall growth rate of domestic, not SQ, but domestic internal growth rate. So it's in that mid-single-digit range of growth for that business. Remember, we really are still consolidating a lot of the sales teams and just now leveraging the Stericycle team.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Right. And when you offer that broadly, obviously, you'll expect that to grow much faster?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Correct. It should, correct.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then final question on StrongPak. When you -- if you get a new StrongPak customer, a retailer, for example, let's say, 1,000 storefronts, do you count it as 1 customer or 1,000 customers?", "Frank J. M. Ten Brink", "We cover that as 1,000. We do everything by locations that we service, sites.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Sites, correct.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions. I'll return the conference to the presenters.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Thank you. And we appreciate everyone taking time to participate on today's call. We will see some of you on the road later this quarter. Have a great evening, and enjoy the rest of your summer. Take care.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you, and I would now like to turn the conference over to Sean McMillan, Vice President of Corporate Finance.

Alutto", "Thanks, Sean. We are very excited to report our fourth quarter and year-end results. As you will see, our strong fourth quarter closed out another successful year for Stericycle. Our business continues to do well on a number of fronts, especially in the areas of internal growth, acquisitions and free cash flow. Joining me on today's call to review our fourth quarter and year-end results will be Dan Ginnetti, CFO; and Brent Arnold, COO.", "I will now turn it over to Dan.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti", "Thank you, Charlie. The results for the fourth quarter are as follows. Revenues were $676.9 million, up 19.2% from $567.9 million in Q4 2013. And internal growth, excluding returns and recall revenues, was up 8%. Domestic revenues were $479.7 million, of which $462.7 million was domestic-regulated waste and compliance services and $17 million was recalls and returns. Domestic internal growth, excluding recalls and returns revenues, was up 7.3%, consisting of SQ, up 8%; and LQ, up 7%. International revenues were $197.2 million. And internal growth adjusted for unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $17 million was up 10%. Acquisitions contributed $93.1 million to the growth in the quarter. Gross profit was $285.4 million or 42.2% of revenues.", "SG&A expense, including amortization, was $124.2 million or 18.3% of revenues. Net interest expense was $18.1 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $82.5 million or $0.96 per share on an as-reported basis and $1.12 adjusted for acquisition-related expenses and other adjusted items.", "Now for the balance sheet. Our covenant debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.22 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of the revolver at the end of the quarter was approximately $577 million. In the quarter, we repurchased 264,574 shares of common stock in the open market in the amount of $33.7 million. At the end of the quarter, we have authorization to purchase 4.7 million shares. Our CapEx was $20.2 million. Our DSO was 63 days. Year-to-date as-reported cash from operations was $448.5 million. When adjusted for recall reimbursement and one timers, cash from operations was $502.6 million.", "I'll now turn it over to Brent.", "Brent Arnold", "Thanks, Dan. In 2014, the team made great progress in all areas of the business. Let me highlight a couple of the accomplishments.", "We increased our regulated waste operational infrastructure, enabling the continued growth of our retail and SQ regulated waste business. We expanded our international operations, completing 27 acquisitions in 10 countries, including a new geography, South Korea. We upgraded the pollution control systems across our U.S. network of incinerators and complied with new EPA Title V standards, reducing our emission significantly. In the quarter, we closed 9 acquisitions, 5 domestic and 4 international. The international acquisitions were 2 in Brazil and 2 in Argentina. The revenues from the 9 acquisitions were $7 million in the quarter and annualized, approximately $43 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust, with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business.", "I'm pleased to report that the integration of the PSC acquisition continues to be on track and that the business is performing well. As we have mentioned in previous calls, as PSC synergies take effect, our margins will continue to improve.", "Our international business delivered strong internal growth in the quarter. The team remains focused on multiple revenue opportunities in all geographies. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 601,000 accounts, of which 579,000 were small and the remainder were large.", "Looking ahead, we remain excited about our expanding growth opportunities. Whether the customer is a physician practice, a large hospital system, a Fortune 1000 company or a retail chain, Stericycle provides multiple services to help them improve their operations and to achieve their goals. As we execute on this strategy, we can more than triple our customer revenues.", "In closing, I would like to thank each member of our worldwide team for their focus on our core values, commitment to our customers and strong performance for our shareholders.", "I will now turn it over to Charlie.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Thanks, Brent. I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2015. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements, and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration, acquisition-related and other adjusting items.", "Our current 2015 guidance does include an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange of approximately $17 million in revenue and $0.06 in earnings per share. For 2015, we believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.63 to $4.69. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2015 will be in the range of $2.8 billion to $2.85 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and negative impact from foreign exchange rates.", "We anticipate 2015 internal growth rates to be: SQ, 8% to 10%; LQ, 5% to 8%; international, 6% to 9%; and recall and returns revenues between $95 million to $120 million. We believe analysts will have estimates for 2015 free cash flow between $445 million to $456 million. 2015 CapEx is anticipated to be between $96 million to $100 million. We expect the full year as-reported tax rate to be approximately 36%.", "In closing, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results and remain excited about our multiple growth opportunities for 2015 and beyond.", "Thank you for your time today. We'll now answer any questions. [Operator Instructions] Jennifer, you can now open the queue.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Dan, given all the moving parts in the quarter, I was hoping you could start with maybe the gross margin bridge sequentially that gives us the various puts and takes.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti", "Yes, absolutely. So versus the prior quarter, gross margins were up 30 basis points. We're favorably impacted by about 45 points when you combine the PSC synergies and our normal business improvements. The acquisitions in the quarter were unfavorable for about 6 basis points, and we had an unfavorable 9 basis point impact with fuel and energy reductions that were offset by increases in insurance and benefits. So a nice 30-point improvement for the quarter.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. And then, Charlie, I guess my follow-up is just a bigger question -- bigger picture question. With all the stuff we're hearing about ACOs and shifting risk to providers and Medicare Advantage capitation rates for providers, are you changing your patient communication strategy to help hospitals with HCAHPS scores or do patient surveys or drive more preventive business? Just how are these macro trends that appear pretty big shifting your view on that opportunity as you look forward?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, a great question, Ryan. I think obviously, we talked about this before. Some of the benefits of the Communication Solutions offering that we have are to increase customer satisfaction and outcomes. And that has to do with the post-discharge call and making sure that somebody shows up on time for an appointment. As an example of that opportunity, we were just recently awarded a significant Communication Solutions contract for a very large Midwest IDN, really centered around our automated appointment reminder. So that obviously gets the patient there to help the health care facility in making sure that productivity remains high but also an increasing productivity and satisfaction.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "First off, Charlie, by my calculations, looking at currency back in October relative to where it finished the year, it's looking like maybe you lost $0.01 relative to that. And then when we look at the RMS shortfall, it looks pretty similar to last quarter, where I think you said it was about $0.04 relative to your expectation and should be kind of in the low to mid-$20 million range. Are those fair?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti", "Yes, I'll take that, David. Good question. The recall business was down about $0.04, as you expected, from the quarter. The foreign exchange, combined with a little bit of impact in -- our international recall was about $0.02, actually, when you combine the 2. Cash in the quarter offset that, and our core business was right at guidance.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Right, okay. Great. And then second, maybe if you could give us a status update on the Communication Solutions IT platform unification and then if there's been any consolidation of facilities yet or if there's a time line you should talk about.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Sure, David. In fact, I just came back from our national sales meeting last week, where the ComSol team -- our Communication Solutions team presented to our team members on the service capabilities and our operational improvements. And of course, those operational improvements include the platform infrastructure. It's important because as we make improvements in our operation, it really -- we've said this before. It differentiates our service in the marketplace. Certainly, we're on track. We gave a lot of details to it on the last call and all the different aspects of that operational infrastructure, how we're going to be piloting that now and some -- and implementing some of that through 2015. And I'll tell you we're right on track of that, and I was really pleased on the presentations that took place last week at our national sales meeting.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to start with the PSC acquisition and get an update on the integration. I know you've said it's \"going well.\" But we're probably now in the Phase 2, and maybe if you'd just take a step back and give us some of the pluses and minuses that you've seen from the transaction.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, I think when you think about PSC, certainly, Brent having the opening comments they're on track. But to give you a little bit more color on what do we mean by that, most of our legacy-regulated waste volume has now been internalized. So we've internalized that into the TSD structure -- TSDF structure that we've acquired in PSC. Really, we remain excited about the future opportunity that, that infrastructure has given us. So from that standpoint, I think the high expectations we had about the growth of this business with the infrastructure that PSC had is coming to fruition. The teams are fully integrated. All the teams are working together, and we're really kind of under one umbrella now, which we've newly branded Stericycle Environmental Solutions. The one thing I'll remind everybody about is the seasonality in that business. We've talked about it a little bit, Al, on the call right after the PSC acquisition. The project work of that, which is about 20% of the PSC revenue, does tend to come out slow in the first quarter and build up as the year goes on. So we anticipate that same seasonality going in 2015 and that project work building as the year goes on.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Right. My follow-up would be, can you comment, based on some of the input or fuel cost, energy cost, I would have thought we would have seen or we should begin to see some benefit in the model? If not the case, could you help us appreciate the contract structures and whether it's surcharges or fuel benefit or how that works in terms of the contracts?", "Brent Arnold", "Yes, I think it's important just to remind everyone when we look at fuel, we actually look at total energy, and that was 5.3% for the quarter. And that's calculated only on the sectors where we have fuel and energy apply. So that's kind of the impact on the quarter. I think it's also important to remember that we've got surcharges for our fuel and energy, and those will fluctuate. And really, they're mandated by the contract, and we adjust those appropriately. As you probably saw in Q4, while gasoline dropped pretty significantly, diesel lagged behind it and really didn't have that big impact in the quarter.", "Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Brent, can you remind us, though, which of the, say, services or businesses or contracts have the energy component to it?", "Brent Arnold", "Sure. It's around our regulated waste and compliance solution. So it'll be things like Med Waste, the PSC acquisition that we have in the United States. Those are one where there are heavier transportation business, Al.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets.", "Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "In the prepared remarks, you made a comment we've heard before that if you sold everything to all your customers, you could triple revenue. I guess can you give us a sense, just an update, I haven't heard one in a while, how that breaks down? How much of that is more of the regulated medical waste and compliance versus stuff like the hazardous waste and patient communication? And is there plenty of room in all 3 areas, really, is the question.", "Brent Arnold", "Yes, I think if you look in -- and I will guide you to our Investor Relations site. We have a pretty good detail on how that breaks out, and it really hasn't fundamentally changed. On the medical waste side for small practice, the Steri-Safe program, at the highest levels, can more than double our revenues. When you add in things like appointment reminders, live call center work, after-hours answering, that has an opportunity to take that up almost 6x. And in haz waste, even on the SQ side, for certain pharmaceutical drugs that are hazardous upon disposal and even nonhazardous pharmaceutical drugs, that can add additional revenue as well. So on the SQ side, it's probably conservative saying that it can more than triple the revenue. And a lot of those -- or really, virtually all of those additional services still have plenty of runway to go, and some of them are new service offerings for Stericycle. On the hospital side of the business, a little bit different. You're dealing with contracts that have an annual revenue of $30,000 to $35,000 on medical waste. Sharps Management can more than double that revenue. Pharmaceutical waste can more than double that revenue as well. And hazardous waste can go anywhere between $15,000 to $25,000 in revenue, not double it but certainly increase it. And then the Communication Solutions, which, on that slide that we gave in the Investor Relation presentation, doesn't really account for that. Although we are looking to update that slide because we are getting some nice wins with some IDNs on the ComSol side. So I think it's a conservative number. Certainly, not every medical waste customer can be sold every one of those services, but there are a lot of customers that can be up-sold to those additional services.", "Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And how are you progressing overseas layering in more stuff? Any real update there? Is it incremental at this point? Or did you make some good progress in '14?", "Brent Arnold", "Well, overseas, we don't call it Steri-Safe. We call it Clinical Services, and we've really seen some really nice adoption internationally. The last country we rolled it out in was Spain, and we're really pleased with the adoption we're seeing to date.", "Charles A. Alutto", "And I think it's evidenced in some of the internal growth numbers you've seen in the last couple of quarters internationally.", "Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And can I just sneak in one quick numbers one? What's the breakdown of the $93 million acquired -- LTM acquired revenue between domestic and international?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti", "Yes, in the quarter, there are 9 deals. There were 5 domestic deals, 4 international. That was $7 million in acquired revenue in the period and $43 million for the year.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, it's not a 9 -- it's a $43 million number for the quarter, Gary, and we don't have the breakout.", "Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "The LTM, $93.7 million LTM contribution to revenue growth, I think in the past, sometimes, you've given us, how much of that was within the U.S. business versus the international business?", "Charles A. Alutto", "We're going to come back to you, get that for you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Actually, I want to follow up a little bit more on what Gary's talking about. So you've had improved strength internationally. Can you talk about some of the drivers over there and what's taking a hold? And you've mentioned in the last couple of calls, but maybe is there anything in addition over there? And maybe just review what's driving some of the strength there.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Sure. I think obviously, a good international growth number of 10% for the quarter. International growth rates continue to be strong across, really, multiple geographies. We're not just seeing it in one area. It is slightly lower from Q3, but it was slightly impacted due to lower international recalls. Recall -- remember that we do not break out recalls on the international segment. It's included in the business. And quarter-to-quarter, when acquisitions roll on to the base, that might impact the growth rate calculation. But organic growth is very good. I think it's -- obviously, we talked about patient transport services in the U.K. Brent touched on Clinical Services being adopted now in Spain. There are some markets overseas like Canada, Ireland and the U.K. where we have our Sharps Management program. It just depends, really, on the maturity of a country and how many different additional services are rolled out. But we're seeing growth, good growth across the board, Shlomo.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then I would like to just follow up one more on the PSC acquisition. Could you talk about progress you've made in terms of growing that business? I know you don't break it out separately, but you had your own StrongPak business. You've got that business. Are you seeing some any kind of revenue synergies and putting that under the Stericycle name after about 9 months or so?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, I think from a very high level business, it's on track with the expectations with respect to revenue. Right now, we're integrating both PSC and the StrongPak to the legacy Stericycle business. So it's tough to say is the Stericycle name helping us. We think it is. We think branding it Stericycle Environmental Solutions will help. Obviously, the retail is in that business. And with respect to upside, you see now 2 quarters in a row where the project work has been a surprise for us. A little bit higher and kind of a negative impact a little bit on gross margins. But certainly, we've evidenced over the last couple of quarters that the revenues is doing a little bit better than expected.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti", "And this is Dan. I'd like to hop in and clear up Gary's question. Gary, I think what you were talking about beyond just the revenue and the acquisitions in the quarter, what you're looking at is the acquired revenue in the quarter, which would include either acquisitions coming in. That split is about 70% domestic, about 30% international.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to hit on RMS briefly. Obviously, a little light in the quarter, yet I see you maintain the 2015 outlook revenue guidance. Just if you guys can provide a little bit of color on -- it was soft, I think, in third quarter as well, but feeling confident going into the next year. Just thoughts there.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes. And Scott, you've followed Stericycle for a long time. If you think back to 2009, it was low on the recall business as well. We were lacking large recalls in 2009 like we have in 2014. But 2010 rebounded to be a record year for that business. So it is an uneven business. But obviously, in our guidance in 2015, we believe that we're going to be within that guidance. And we're confident and comfortable with the guidance that we put forward on today's call of $95 million to $120 million. We're at a record number event in 2014, and I think this demonstrates that our awareness campaign is gaining traction. We're just missing those -- we're lacking those large recalls. We don't think they're happening in the marketplace. We're not losing them to anybody. It's just that they're not out there right now.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "And just following up on that. Are you seeing indication that those are coming? Or is that just the guidance says, well, just by our past history, we would expect 1 or 2 probably coming in the future year, so there is, perhaps, some risk, but not a huge amount of risk? Just whether you see it now or whether it's just assumed over the 12 months.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, I think obviously, the high end of our guidance assumes 2 to 4 very large recalls in 2015. You don't get much visibility when those come. They tend to come right away. But obviously, I think by our guidance, we have sent the message that we feel really good about the number for 2015, even though we've had 2 slower recall quarters the last 2 quarters.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "And just following up on Shlomo's question on international drivers. Obviously ticked up the growth rate, international organic growth rate. In third quarter, you announced the big patient transportation win. And in response to his question, you talked about some of the things that were going well. Is the move higher purely that -- the patient transportation? Or are there other components that are contributing?", "Charles A. Alutto", "It's certainly a contributor, but there are other contributing factors. As we said before, Clinical Services and multiple services in other countries. And as I said, the international growth rate is strong across multiple geographies.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just a quick question on the tax rate guidance you gave. I mean, if I look at the numbers here, your tax rate has kind of come down steadily over the last, I think, 4, 5 years. And your guidance here is coming from a pretty sharp rebound. I was curious why that was the case. And is that something to do with the geographic mix this year or another dynamic here that would drive it higher?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti", "If you remember, we gave you guidance last quarter of 35% to -- 35.5% to 36%. The reason for that is we don't give guidance on onetime nonrecurring events. And those would be such things as tax rate changes that we don't know about, some of our work on our international entity structure, our tax optimization plan or even things that are released from statute that we don't know until they actually -- so the tax rate that we give you is strictly off our core business. Now in going into the rest of the year, I think it's better to move your tax rate up a little bit closer to 36%, and the reason for that shift to the higher end of the range we gave you is, in fact, is the foreign exchange changes that are taking place.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it, okay. And then just a follow-up on the FX dynamic. Really, as it relates to your M&A plans, I mean, the current kind of exchange rate picture would suggest that maybe some of the assets you're looking at overseas are, perhaps, less expensive. So do you feel like the current rates in the environment give you maybe a little more opportunity to be aggressive on M&A overseas?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Certainly, there's an advantage with the strengthening of the dollar when we look at certain markets. All of our deals go through the necessary IRR calcs, does it fit in -- is it strategic fit for the company. But there is a certainly a benefit now with the strengthening dollar to be maybe more aggressive on acquisitions. But as you know, Isaac, sometimes, it's a timing issue when the seller is ready to sell the business. And really, we can't give any more guidance other than that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Barbara Noverini with Morningstar.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "So with StrongPak and PSC doing well domestically, can you talk a little bit about your expectations for replicating that kind of business internationally? Which of the international markets most closely resemble the U.S. with respect to retail and retail pharmacy, hazardous waste? And will this be an important strategy in growing the international SQ customer base in the future?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, I think it's too early to start rolling out across the board in the international markets. But certainly, from a country that's very similar now to the U.S. with respect to a framework or regulations, same type of retailers. In fact, sometimes, the same retailer will be Canada as one of those marketplaces. But we continue to explore the markets we think, longer term, that could be an opportunity. Right now, the focus is on the U.S. and Canada.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten with Macquarie.", "Adam Baumgarten - Macquarie Research", "Just wondering if you could break down the 9 acquisitions by service type?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti", "Yes. Eight of those acquisitions were in the regulated waste field, and there was one recall acquisition.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Erin Wilson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "It's Erin. You gave some color on the sequential trend in the gross margin. What was the underlying growth margin trend on a year-over-year basis, like excluding the acquisition-related impacts? And how should we think about the quarterly progression of that trend?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti", "I think it's very difficult, Erin, to look at it that way with all the acquisitions and the movements, especially in a year where we have the PSC acquisition. They really move that up and down. So I think you'd be better to look at the sequential improvement that we looked at in the fourth quarter.", "Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And how should we think about, I guess, the quarterly progression going into 2015 on that trend?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti", "I think going into Q1, we think we've moved to about a 43.15%. And then after that, you're going to get your about 10 to 15 basis points after that. The reason for the jump in the first quarter is there is expectation that the recall business will come back. Also, that some of that project work that is a question whether it will come back or not. If it doesn't, that gross margin will go up. And then foreign exchange impact will benefit about 25 basis points. And then there's a little bit of a headwind or unfavorable from acquisitions of 11 basis points. And then our core business of PSC will pull up. I think at this point, also, it would be very good when you go into Q1, it's very important to look at it flat, as we've given guidance before. And in this case also, for EPS, I think I'd like to guide you to about $1.10. And the reason for that is we are -- we certainly just shared with you some foreign exchange headwinds. We're going to have some normalization of our tax rate. And then with recall coming back and our core business improvements, I think $1.10 is a very good starting point and then the 3 quarters following that, about a $0.04 per quarter increase quarter-over-quarter. And that should put you right into our guidance level.", "Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great. That's excellent color. And then we've seen some high-profile data breaches in health care of late with the news of Anthem today. Do you have any exposure there, particularly, and I guess, on the patient communication side? Or maybe is that even an opportunity for you as potential customers seek, I guess, HIPAA-compliant communication services?", "Charles A. Alutto", "I mean, obviously, we don't feel we have an exposure. We monitor it closely. We have safeguards for our Communication Solutions business. As an opportunity as a business, Erin, we've looked at it. There are a lot of players in that space. We continue to monitor, but I don't see us entering that space anytime soon or possibly never entering that space from a compliance standpoint.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.", "Scott Lange", "It's actually Scott Lange in for David. Dan, I guess how should we expect SG&A to trend over the coming years? On one hand, we might expect some G&A leverage on a company that's growing sales so quickly. On the other hand, you do run a fairly tight ship to begin with. To what extent -- can you share with us to what extent will investments and kind of ancillary services or other growth drivers start to show up in the P&L?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti", "Yes, I think if you are looking into 2015, about 18.5%. Really, throughout the year is a comfortable level. I think you hit the nail on the head. You'll see a little bit of both. You'll see some investments. At the same point in time you're going to see us as we're moving into some of these new avenues with PSC and other, we begin to see leverage. And I think right now, about 18.5% is a good position for us for the year to accomplish both our leverage and our investments.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, and I think, Scott, certainly, we're a bit discipline of SG&A, but we've shown in our history that if we've got a hot hand, we're going to make some of those investments over time to feed the hot hand in the business.", "Scott Lange", "That's perfectly understandable. And then, Charlie, I guess, for you, as you think about kind of future targets for M&A, can you share with us kind of how you think about it in terms of balancing investments to build scale in markets that you already have a presence in versus, say, entering into new markets or new verticals?", "Charles A. Alutto", "I think to answer that question from a regulated waste standpoint, when we enter a new market, we try to buy a larger player because we want to buy some of that infrastructure. And you've seen that in the recent acquisitions in Japan, in Brazil, in South Korea, the most recent. And then from there, look at strategic acquisitions that can leverage off that infrastructure from a tuck-in strategy. It varies by country. We try to test first before we double down. But certainly, when it comes to buying scale, we've done it before in Communication Solutions, and we've done it in our international strategy for our regulated waste business.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Kevin Steinke with Barrington Research.", "Kevin M. Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Just wanted to clarify with the 2015 guidance. Basically, you're taking $0.06 out of the previous guidance for currency and EPS, right? That's the way to think about it?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Correct, Kevin, yes.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti", "Yes, that's correct.", "Kevin M. Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "And then revenue, you're increasing by the acquisitions completed in the quarter plus some better performance internationally, and then you take out $70 million in currency.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti", "Yes, let me bridge you on both of those. Those are great questions. Let's start with the revenue first. If you look at our prior guidance, acquisitions contributing next year about $43 million and then approximately $70 million of headwinds due to foreign exchange, and that's how you're going to get to the $2.8 billion to $2.85 billion. From an EPS guidance, you're absolutely right. Prior guidance was $4.69 to $4.75. We had the $0.06 of foreign exchange headwind and then the acquisitions of about $0.02. That was offset by some higher costs and benefits and stock options. So that's where you're going to get to the $4.63 to $4.69.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Richard Close with Avondale Partners.", "Richard Collamer Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "As we look at 2015, I mean, I guess try to get your perspective on what do you think are the biggest opportunities for you as the year progresses. And as you look out, what are you most concerned with in the coming year?", "Charles A. Alutto", "I think from an opportunity standpoint, obviously, the PSC platform or the Stericycle Environmental Solutions gives us a great opportunity to grow that part of the business and stay within that internal growth rate, obviously. All the growth rates that we have are very important, so I think the opportunities are Environmental Solutions, our compliance services and our Communication Solutions helping us get to our internal growth rates, remaining focused on M&A and making sure that we do deals, that those deals are a strategic fit for the business. To your point around what are some of the uncertainties, certainly, there are business risks in anything that we do. We want to make sure that as we continue to grow, we have the right people in place and the right culture to continue to grow this business for many years to come.", "Richard Collamer Close - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then with acquisitions, are there any countries or additional services that you think may come into the fold over the next year?", "Charles A. Alutto", "We certainly are looking at countries that we're not in today, in regions that we are in today would be the most logical expansions for us. We obviously don't disclose which countries they are, and it's hard to predict timing of when we'd enter those countries. But certainly, it wouldn't be out of the realm of possibilities that in a couple of years, we're in new countries. From a service aspect, we've talked about this before. Sometimes, we have services that work in the U.S. and we can take those overseas. They can cross into other countries. Sometimes, we find services like in Spain with the dosimetry services that work in that country that also work maybe in that region. So we're open to not only taking stuff in the U.S. and sharing it overseas but also learning in some of the markets that we're in and taking those services and taking them into other countries in those regions.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Sean Dodge with Jefferies.", "Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "So going back to the patient transport contracts you guys signed in the third quarter. Last we spoke, you mentioned some structural changes to that market that could possibly create some more opportunities like that. Has anything changed about the outlook there? And what's the likelihood we'd see some additional transport wins over the next several quarters?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, I think what you're referring to is my comments about how we have a combo of Communication Solutions and patient transport opportunity. We're taking some of the different Stericycle capabilities, Communication Solutions with our patient transport, and we're really offering a differentiated products in the marketplace. That remains on track. There's really no fundamental change from that, that premise. From the ERS perspective, it continue to be contributors to the international growth rate. We've talked about how we've had success on NHS contracts, and the team is really implementing those contracts well. And so we're excited about building on our multiple service strategy in all the different geographies that we're in.", "Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then -- so realizing your international segment is spread over a bunch of countries that are all in various stages of being built out, if we look at just the most mature of the foreign markets, so maybe like an Ireland or a U.K., how did the margins in those countries compare to what you're earning in the United States currently?", "Charles A. Alutto", "Yes, I think we look at it regionally. So obviously, from a regional perspective, the margins are different. They're less. We're not as mature in some of the service offerings that we have in the United States. Certainly, when you look -- and we've talked about this before. In some of those markets, the LQ margins are better than the LQ margins in the U.S. But our SQ margins in the U.S. are better than those SQ margins internationally. As we roll out additional services, we hope to bring up the entire margin profile of our international business.", "Operator", "And we have no further questions in queue at this time. And I would like to turn the conference back over to our presenters.", "Charles A. Alutto", "Thank you, Jennifer. Thank you for your time. We appreciate your continued support of Stericycle. We'll speak to you again in April and hopefully see you on the road over the next couple of months.

Sean McMillan, Vice President, Corporate Finance, you may begin your conference.", "Sean McMillan", "Welcome to Stericycle's first quarter 2015 conference call.", "I will now read the Safe Harbor statement.

We feel confident about our 2015 guidance, as all lines of business remain on track, despite headwinds from extreme weather in the quarter and the continued pressure from foreign exchange.", "Joining me on today's call to review our first quarter results will be Dan Ginnetti, CFO; and Brent Arnold, COO.", "I'll now turn it over to Dan.", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Thanks, Charlie. The results for the first quarter are as follows. Revenues were $663.3 million, up 16.4% from $570 million in Q1 2014. Internal growth, excluding returns and recall revenues, was up 6.8%.", "Domestic revenues were $472.2 million, of which $452.3 million was domestic regulated waste and compliance services and $20 million was recalls and returns. Domestic internal growth, excluding recalls and returns revenues, was up 6.4%, consisting of SQ up 8% and LQ up 5%.", "International revenues were $191.1 million. And internal growth, adjusted for unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $23.1 million, was up 8%. Acquisitions contributed $86.3 million to the growth in the quarter.", "Gross profit was $281.3 million or 42.4% of revenues. SG&A expense, including amortization, was $128.3 million or 19.3% of revenues. Net interest expense was $18.6 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $75.5 million or $0.87 per share on an as-reported basis, and $1.08 adjusted for acquisition-related expenses and other adjusted items.", "Now for the balance sheet. Our covenant debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.09 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of the revolver at the end of the quarter was approximately $867 million. In the quarter, we repurchased 100,713 shares of common stock on the open market in an amount of $13.8 million. At the end of the quarter, we have authorization to purchase 4.6 million shares.", "Our CapEx was $21.4 million. Our DSO was 63 days. Year-to-date, as-reported cash from operations was $132.6 million. When adjusted for recall reimbursement and one-timers, cash from operations was $145.3 million.", "I will now turn it over to Brent.", "Brent Arnold", "Thanks, Dan. Worldwide we continue to use our strong free cash flow to drive our growth through acquisition. In the quarter, we closed 15 acquisitions, four domestic and 11 international. The international acquisitions were three in South Korea, one in Brazil, one in Mexico -- I'm sorry, three in South Korea, two in Brazil, two in Mexico, two in Romania, one in Ireland and one in Spain.", "Revenues from the 15 acquisitions were $7.5 million in the quarter, and annualized are approximately $42.5 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business.", "This week marks the one-year anniversary of the PSC Environmental Services acquisition. We are very pleased to report the synergies we discussed in the areas of long-haul transportation, route density and disposal cost has been achieved. The integrated business, which will be branded as, Stericycle Environmental Solution, is positioned for future improvements, investments and growth.", "On the international front, the team continues to drive strong internal growth. We recently returned from a trip from Latin America, where we reviewed our strategic growth plans, numerous continuous improvement projects and newly acquired businesses. The international team has made significant progress in many areas, and we remain excited about our growth opportunities in all geographies.", "Looking ahead, we continue to see expanding growth opportunities, as Stericycle provides multiple services to help our customers improve their operations and achieve their goals. As we execute on this strategy, we can more than triple our customer revenues.", "As we celebrate Earth Day this week, we would like to thank all of our worldwide team members for their continued commitment to helping customers promote health and safeguard the environment.", "I'll now turn it over to Charlie.", "Charles Alutto", "Thanks, Brent. I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2015. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements, and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration, acquisition-related and other adjusting items.", "For 2015, we believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.64 to $4.69. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2015 will be in the range of $2.81 billion to $2.86 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and negative impact from foreign exchange rates.", "We anticipate 2015 internal growth rate to be; SQ, 8% to 10%; LQ, 5% to 8%; international, 6% to 9%; and recall and returns revenues between $95 million to $120 million. We believe analysts will have estimates for 2015 free cash flow between $445 million to $456 million.", "2015 CapEx is anticipated to be between $96 million to $100 million. We expect the full year as-reported tax rate to be in the range of 34.5% to 35%.", "In closing, we are very pleased with our first quarter 2015 results, and remain excited about our multiple growth opportunities for 2015 and beyond. Thank you for your time today.", "We will now answer any questions. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question as necessary. Amy, you can now open the Q&A queue.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels from William Blair.", "Nick Hiller", "This is Nick Hiller in for Ryan Daniels. I was just wondering if you could provide an update on the communication services business. I guess I had a two-fold question. One, how is the 2015 sales pipeline shaping up there? And two, any update on the new IT platform? As I think that's been piloted for some time now, so just curious what benefits you're seeing, and if it's ready for a broader rollout.", "Charles Alutto", "I think on the sales pipeline, Nick, obviously right now, Comm Sol, we talked about before is growing at domestic averages. With our new operational improvements that are ongoing and our recently trained sales force, we believe there is upside for that business. We're really excited about the building sales pipeline we see for Communication Solutions.", "With respect to your question on the platform, if you remember, we talked previously last year about the piloting and ongoing implementation of our infrastructure, how that was going to take place at the end of 2014 and also run through 2015. I'm really excited to report that that is on track. The team is making really good progress on the new systems and platform for the Communication Solutions business.", "Nick Hiller", "And a related question. Are the IT improvements here increasing your conviction about the ability to integrate this business more effectively and maybe thus increasing your appetite for acquisitions in that area?", "Charles Alutto", "Great follow-on question, Nick. Absolutely. I think its two things. Obviously, the platform -- we're buying a lot of companies that are running on antiquated and outdated systems, they lack scalability. So first benefit we get is running on a system that runs more efficiently is up and running, not running down. So it helps the existing business. We feel it gives a better customer experience to our customers.", "But in the end, as we get all of those systems aligned, get all the call centers on the same systems, it does make the ability to integrate much easier and hopefully reduces the turnaround time to integrate the Communication Solutions acquisition.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee from RBC.", "Gunnar Hansen", "This is Gunnar Hansen in for Gary Bisbee. I just had a quick question. I guess, with regards to the U.S. business, obviously saw some deceleration there, excluding returns and recall. Could you help kind of bridge some of the deceleration there and what gives you confidence to kind of reaccelerate that throughout the year?", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Yes, I think you're looking at really the revenue compared to guidance. We were about $13.8 million off of guidance. The majority of that was really due to the extreme weather impact that we had and its impact on seasonality, as well as the lower energy surcharges that we got in Q1. And that was combined about $11.1 million impact.", "We also had foreign exchange impact in the quarter that was unfavorable by about $3.5 million. The lower recall revenues were really offset by the Q1 acquisitions and improvements in the business, and the net of those was up about $800,000.", "Gunnar Hansen", "And I guess just more broadly speaking, can you guys kind of give an up update on the penetration, I guess, within Steri-Safe, particularly in the SQ customer base?", "Charles Alutto", "I think when you look at the growth drivers for our SQ customer base in the U.S., there are several growth drivers that drive our organic internal growth. Steri-Safe is one of them. Communication Solutions, our hazardous waste, our Environmental Solutions business Brent talked about, the recently completed integration of the PSC, really they all contribute.", "We continue to improve the Steri-Safe offering, which gives us an ability to increase value for our customers and opportunity to also accelerate revenue growth and profitability.", "Gunnar Hansen", "And just lastly, just kind of a housekeeping question. Any particular reason for the lower tax rate in the quarter? I guess, what kind of drove the lower tax rate there?", "Daniel Ginnetti", "The tax rate really comes from some really great execution by our tax team on the entity structure and our tax optimization strategies. And so that had great impact within the quarter. That lowered it. Going forward, we don't give guidance to those one-time events, the releases of statute, or other entity structures. So I think for Q2, you were going to look in the range of about 35.5% to 36%; and again for the year, which will include the great work in Q1 of about a 34.5% to 35%.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Steinke from Barrington Research.", "Kevin Steinke", "Congrats on getting the PSC synergies done and in place. Just kind of wondering what's next as you look forward with PSC. Do you expect to continue to see margin improvement there as the business is just further integrated into your overall operations?", "Charles Alutto", "Thanks, Kevin. As Brent alluded to on the opening comments, we feel really good about the integration. It is complete. The areas where we said we would get those integration expenses, we hit those. That's a long haul transportation. It's the route density. It's the disposal options that we have, the waste disposal business.", "Most of our legacy volume that Stericycle had pre-PSC acquisition has been integrated. We remain really excited about the future opportunity, because this new infrastructure gives us a unique ability in the marketplace. And obviously now going forward, we really want to go with the brand, which is Stericycle Environmental Solutions.", "We talked about on the last call certainly we think there is an opportunity to increase margins. Right now, those margins for ComSol are -- I'm sorry, Environmental Solutions is the mid-20s gross margins and even in the low teens. We think over a longer period of time, we can raise those to the high 20s and low 30s and EBIT margins in Environmental Solutions in the mid-to high teens, so certainly an opportunity there in the long run to improve the margins of that business.", "Kevin Steinke", "And my second question is just around the gross margin sequentially, the puts and takes there. And I think on your last call, you talked about recall potentially helping that gross margin sequentially, but just wondering how recall impacted gross margin and just the puts and takes sequentially.", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Let me take you through the Q-to-Q gross margin roll. We're very pleased with the performance in the quarter. Gross margin expanded 26 basis points Q-over-Q. You'll recall, Q4 gross margin was at 42.15. There was some unfavorability of about 45 basis points from acquisitions and the weather's impact on seasonality. Those were offset by favorable impact of about 44 basis points from foreign exchange and the lower revenues from our lower energy surcharges, or from the surcharges and project work. Our core business improved by about 27 basis points.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "Can you go over, what was the recalls revenue? From the front pages, kind of the organic growth calculation, it looks like its $16.1 million, but I thought I heard something like $20 million?", "Charles Alutto", "I'm going to repeat that a little bit, Shlomo, because you're coming in very low. I think your question was the front page of the press release -- ", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "Can you hear me now?", "Charles Alutto", "I can hear you much better now, yes.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "Sorry. Front page of the press release, it looked like the recalls revenue was $16.1 million in the quarter, and I thought you said it was $20 million. So I'm wondering if I read something wrong or heard something wrong.", "Charles Alutto", "No, you got it right. The actual number came in at $20 million. The press release says $16.1 million, because the additional revenue came from that recall acquisition that we announced in Q4. And so that wound up in the acquisition bucket on the press release, but the actual number for RMS was $20 million.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "So when I'm looking at the waste management kind of bucket of revenue, I'm looking at a sequential decline of revenue of like $11.5 million. And we don't usually see that in your business. So I'm just trying to understand -- I understand there was weather-related items, but I go back 10 years in the business, you just don't usually see that. Is there something particularly impactful in this last quarter?", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Yes, Shlomo, I'll take that. When you're looking at just the raw numbers out there, you did see a quarter-to-quarter decline of $13.8 million. But rest assured there was really some good growth in our core business within that. So let me take you through the bridge to that $13.8 million.", "There was an $11 million of increase in revenue from acquisitions that was offset by $11.1 million decrease due to weather and its impact on seasonality, as well as the lower energy surcharge. Also, foreign exchange was a decrease of revenue by $12.6 million. And also, Shlomo, when you're comparing quarter to quarter, there was one less business day in Q1 compared to Q4, and that was about a $5 million impact. And so when you net that down, we had some organic growth of $3.9 million.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "So I'm not looking at ForEx, I'm just looking at the domestic numbers right now. So when I take the domestic numbers, right, so last quarter, if I take everything excluding the recall, returns and recalls, you should be -- where was that, about 463.6 or something, and coming down to 452.2, I believe, this quarter. So that's what I'm comparing right now. I heard kind of a weather-related impact of kind of $11 million would get you around flat. I'm looking for the bridge to after that.", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Yes, so with the growth that you saw in there, I think it was the $8.3 million decline, about $3.4 million of that was due to acquisitions. Obviously, there's no foreign exchange when we're talking strictly the domestic number. And about half of the working days was $2.5 million. And the rest of that is offset with the seasonality and then the growth within that. So the seasonality was a little bit larger, but the growth within it was really able to offset a good chunk of that.", "Charles Alutto", "And the $1.5 million approximately in the fuel surcharge that came off, Shlomo, in Q1 that came off in Q1, that was on in Q4.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "And then I'm going to want to follow up on that offline, because I can't follow the numbers exactly. But can you give me more detail on what the planned conversion expenses are? Is this the incinerator in Utah or is this something to do with PSC?", "Daniel Ginnetti", "You're talking about the restructure line?", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "Yes.", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Yes, so that's a combination of a number of things. That restructure will reflect some facility and plant closures. That will be some write-off of some permits, as well as we took this opportunity from a restructure basis to really realign our business and better set us up for growth into the future.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Following on the restructuring question, I'll go with that up front. Is that something that we're going to see again in next quarter? I don't anticipate you guys announce these things ahead of time. But will it have a sizable lag effect into the second quarter or perhaps --?", "Charles Alutto", "Let me take it a little deeper on t he restructure, and then I can answer your question around whether or not you'll see it in Q2, Scott. We have experienced, obviously, experienced a large growth over several businesses the last couple of years. Following the integration of the PSC acquisition, we took the opportunity to kind of balance and optimize our structure over all of our lines of business if the US.", "We intend to reinvest those savings, primarily in the area of sales and marketing, across all of the lines of business. And Scott, you know, we talk about this all the time, we continually kind of reassess where we are, feed the hot hand with respect to reassessing our resources and allocations. From time to time, we have things that happen in the Q. We don't expect anything sizable in the next quarter.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Switching it up, with the acquisitions in the quarter, certainly very geographically disbursed. Could you just address, four U.S., 11 international, kind of hone in a little bit on was it all med waste? Were there any more communication solutions, just kind of a feel for what types?", "Brent Arnold", "All 15 of the acquisitions we did was in the regulated waste and compliance services. And as we mentioned, four of them were domestic, 11 were international.", "Scott Schneeberger", "And when you say regulated waste, does that mean medical and hazardous, or were they all medical?", "Brent Arnold", "Yes, about two of those were in the hazardous area and the rest in the medical area.", "Scott Schneeberger", "And those were domestic, I would assume, on the hazardous?", "Brent Arnold", "Correct, Scott.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Manthey from Robert W. Baird.", "David Manthey", "First off, I guess on this tax rate, as I'm looking at the adjusted EPS here, if the tax rate had been more of a mid-30s kind of number, you would have reported a number that would be less than $1 I think. And the reason that I ask is you say that everything's on track, but yet next quarter, if the tax rate goes back to that mid-30s range, operationally you have to get $0.09, $0.10 better than you were this quarter. Now, I'm just trying to square that circle in terms of it would seem like operationally this quarter there was some slippage. I didn't hear what's going to change $0.09 to $0.10 between this quarter and next quarter that's going to unwind that.", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Let me take you through that. So the Street estimates was at $1.10. We did have $0.08 of favorable result in the quarter, with our continued tax optimization strategy. What that did is that really offset the lower recall volume, the FX headwinds that we experienced and the majority of the impact from the weather", "This was no doubt, a very tough quarter. I'm very pleased with the team. They did a magnificent job of pulling together and executing on our optimization strategy. But if you think about it, a lot of the areas where we adjusted down, we fully expect that to be rebound into the next quarter. And that's why what you've seen is our guidance has remained unchanged from an EPS standpoint.", "David Manthey", "Could you just run us down, just so I have this clear here, in terms of the negative impact, maybe EPS standpoint, if it's easier for you to talk about, the returns and recall business, FX, and then fuel, if there's any impact there. Could you give us those items in EPS just so we know what unwinds as we go forward?", "Daniel Ginnetti", "So the weather and the seasonality, really the extreme weather was about $0.03. The recall was about $0.04. We really anticipate both of those to rebound very nicely. And then there's $0.01 in FX. That was all offset -- and so the seasonality and weather combined to be about $0.05. We call for FX, one, and we really expect the seasonality, the weather and the recall to rebound and really offset the impact of FX.", "David Manthey", "Last question, on the international 8%, remind me, is that local currency or does that include the impact of FX?", "Charles Alutto", "It's excluding FX. It's local currency.", "David Manthey", "That's what I thought.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk from Wedbush Securities.", "Al Kaschalk", "I want to focus on the strategic review that you guys did in Latin America. Can you give us a size of that business relative to just in probably percentage terms, what that business comprises? And then is that a market where you're, quote, most excited about? I would appreciate any additional color you could share on that.", "Brent Arnold", "Overall, we don't disclose what the size per country is. I would tell you that we are excited about things we saw both in Argentina and Brazil, where our trip took Charlie and I to both locations. One exciting thing we saw was the opening of a brand-new bio systems facility in Brazil. And it was nice to see them secure some customers for that new facility. We also saw the expansion of our clinical services business in both countries.", "But they're doing a really nice job, particularly in Argentina, of expanding that. So overall, I think we're excited about the different growth engines in South America, but also all of our countries. They've got a lot of exciting things going on in Europe, as well, with the different services they're expanding there, as well.", "Charles Alutto", "And as you know, Al, we break out Europe and other international. So LATAM is in obviously part of that other international. It's a big part of that other international business, because the other parts of that are the Asian market, which are much smaller.", "Al Kaschalk", "And then my follow, or second part question, maybe it's a bigger picture, maybe we all already appreciated, but the weather impact, help me understand why this was so impactful here. Is this because sort of the Tennessee, Kentucky, down south and east, was freezing rain and therefore trucks and routes were disrupted, or add a little more maybe Business 101 commentary on that. And then if you could tie into that what percentage of your contracts have a fuel and energy surcharge associated with them.", "Brent Arnold", "Well, let's start with weather first. This was probably -- I've been here a decade, and this is probably the worst winter I have seen while being at Stericycle, especially from an operational perspective. It hit us both on revenue and from a cost perspective. So from a revenue perspective, you mentioned it, every single month, January, February, and March, we had several days in each of those months where we literally could not get the trucks out at several domiciles, whether it was ice storms -- and I would tell you the ice storms probably hurt you more than the snow storms, because as we know, those Midwest states, the Tennessee's, the Kentucky's of the world, the Missouri's, are just not prepared to handle that kind of weather. So we literally had several days we couldn't get the trucks out.", "And then when we did get the trucks out, only a small percentage of the trucks could actually make all the stops, which then kind of rolls over into the cost perspective. I'm now going and picking up those stops the day after, the day after that, the next week, and I'm paying overtime to get those pickups.", "Probably the most interesting cost that we incurred this year is that I've never seen before, we literally had to shovel the roofs of several of our facilities, both plants and transfer stations in different locations. And if you've never paid for shoveling a roof, it's a very big bill, as you not only have to shovel the roof, but you then have to haul the snow away. And I got the pleasure of seeing those bills over several states and several facilities.", "Charles Alutto", "I know as you sit in out California, Al, you kind of don't appreciate some of the weather out for the folks in the East Coast.", "Brent Arnold", "From a fuel and energy, you also asked that, as well. Overall, our fuel and energy was about 5.1% for the quarter. And as you know, we don't break out kind of how many of our customers have the surcharge. But as Charlie, I think alluded to earlier, we did face a $1.5 million headwind, as our surcharges, as we address by contract were reduced in the quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro", "Maybe just to switch gears a little bit and ask about the big picture environment for the business. I'd curious we've seen a couple of hospitals and labs report on overall healthcare volumes in the U.S. I'd be curious if you could maybe opine, I know it's not a direct correlation to your business, but in general what you're seeing both regards to the overall environment, but also just the extent to which healthcare consumption has become more seasonal. If we just kind of try to normalize for the weather impact, how you think healthcare volumes looked and what your expectation is moving into the middle part of the year.", "Charles Alutto", "Isaac, I think that's a good question around, is there a seasonality component now to healthcare. It's tough when you're dealing with all the things that Brent just talked about on weather, and how much truly is a weather impact and how much is it that there is a feeling out there that there could be some seasonality in healthcare and a growing seasonality component to healthcare.", "I think it's a little too early for us to say if there is seasonality and does it impact our business. Certainly on the SQ side, where we have fixed fees on some of the contracts, seasonality doesn't play into it. But when you're talking about large IDNs, large customers, you certainly, you want to look at that. I think it's a little difficult, given the quarter we just had on weather to say that it is definitely some more seasonality.", "I think seasonality for us, when we talk about seasonality it impacts a little bit more on the ESol business. We previously discussed ESol and the experiences that we have in seasonality in Q1. It's important to understand that seasonality is a function in Environmental Solutions on both volume and weather. And with the severe weather we had in Q1, it resulted in a larger than anticipated reduction in volume.", "And to Dan's point around the bridge and what we think is going to happen in the future, we fully anticipate, based on historical knowledge that we have in that space that a majority of that will rebound in 2015. And I think you see our overall confidence in the business for the year, we feel really good about the year. And that's what we want to kind of leave, that we are feeling good about the rebound in the business on both the weather and the seasonality.", "Isaac Ro", "Just one follow-up on M&A. You guys continue to build out the international footprint in multiple geographies. I'd be curious, now that you've had a few years here to sort of get some local knowledge in some of these markets and we're seeing some follow-on deals, and I think you said Spain, and other parts of the EU, et cetera. Can you talk a little about where you think it makes sense to deploy more resources versus less, given what you've learned and where we should expect you guys to be maybe more concentrated as you build the scale?", "Charles Alutto", "I think if you look at the strategy in Asia with the three small tuck-in acquisitions in South Korea, this also marks the one-year anniversary of our deal in South Korea. That integration is on track. We feel really good, at this point, to add in some of those acquisitions. From an investment standpoint, it does make sense to look at the markets that we're in today, because that brings on a better IRR versus the local hurdle rate.", "And then overall, we continue to look at new markets. As you know, we're disciplined and opportunistic when looking at those, and occasionally, we'll add on a new country. But really the focus is on the countries that we're currently in. And I think to your point, a good example of that is the 11 international acquisitions we closed in countries that we're in, in the last quarter. We had a really strong acquisition quarter. We're proud of the team, the M&A team and the integration team, what they pulled off in Q1.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Erin Wilson from Bank of America.", "Erin Wilson", "Can you speak to the impetus for the GXP acquisition? And can you also speak to what else you might add to that GXP business? Should we assume that this should help to explain future acquisitions potentially in that area or with that sort of customer base?", "Brent Arnold", "Yes, good question. That acquisition is a small acquisition we completed in Q1 in Ireland. And where it really fits is our expert solutions business. As you know, we're already serving the pharma market, as well as the device manufacturing market in that space. So this is just a complementary compliance and auditing service that we can add to that portfolio of services to further help those customers. Again, it's early on, we're still testing the space, but we're excited about the opportunity.", "Erin Wilson", "And then on the Environmental Solutions unit, I guess that's what you're calling it, is that something you'd be able to break out sometime in the foreseeable future or think about providing greater disclosure on? Does that even make sense to break it out?", "Daniel Ginnetti", "It really doesn't. There is so much overlap in our business, both from a routing standpoint, the back office support we have. We share customers in both. It would be virtually impossible for us to be able to break that out to the level that would be able to give you any kind of credible information to make any kind of analysis on your part.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten from Macquarie Capital.", "Adam Baumgarten", "Just some of the moving pieces on margins, with weather and things like that. Can you walk us through how we should expect gross margins to ramp throughout the year, especially now that you're lapping the PSC acquisition?", "Daniel Ginnetti", "I can take you through that. For Q2, I think we expect gross margins to be in the range of about 43.2% to 43.3%. And I think that would put you at a full year in the range of 43.4% to 43.5%.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sean Dodge from Jefferies.", "Sean Dodge", "Going back to the Environmental Solutions business, how is the revenue in that part of the business split between small quantity and large quantity accounts, roughly?", "Charles Alutto", "I think when you look at SQ, LQ, Sean, the estimate is around 60% SQ and 40% LQ.", "Sean Dodge", "And then, in your recent filings, you guys cite this business as being one of the two primary drivers of organic growth in the small quantity base. Are you willing to put some book ends around that? Is Environmental Solutions now driving half of your domestic SQ growth now or is it more or less than that or is it a lot more or less than that?", "Charles Alutto", "No, I think if you look at the growth engines on the SQ side of the business, Steri-Safe still provides a majority of the growth on the SQ business. And then Com Sol, Communication Solutions and Environmental Solutions add some additional growth there.", "On the LQ side of the business, again, a majority of the growth is coming from our sharps management program and our pharmaceutical waste programs. We think over time there's a lot of overlap with pharmaceutical waste, where it lends us to get more hazardous waste out of the hospital business. But that's something that obviously we needed the infrastructure first, before we can really take advantage of that opportunity across the country.", "Sean Dodge", "And then, just my last one, you guys rolled out a broader suite of compliance solutions to the physician market. I think it was middle of last year. Can you talk a little bit about the initial adoption of the non-OSHA focused services? And maybe something about the incremental revenue opportunities you get physicians signed up for those?", "Brent Arnold", "One of the services we've expanded to now, and our suite of compliance services that we brand is overall Steri-Safe. Obviously, you're familiar with the OSHA compliance services. One that we've had a lot of success with is HIPAA services, where we can help our customers better understand those regulations, set them up with the policies and procedures they need to make sure that they are appropriately living up to the guidelines. So that's just one of many other compliance services that we're offering to our customers in the SQ space.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Richard Close.", "Richard Close", "You made the acquisition on, I guess, the hospital side, on the communications with Beryl, a couple years ago. Can you talk a little bit about how that expansion has gone over the last several years since you acquired it?", "Charles Alutto", "I think, as you know, the Beryl Health acquisition, probably over two years now, really got us into the more of a hospital or the LQ space in Communication Solutions. Prior to that, the platform that we had bought was NotifyMD, it was more of an SQ play.", "We've seen some good growth on Beryl. It's not really combined. So we don't look at it as LQ, SQ anymore, we kind of look at it together. And the reason for that, Richard, is really some of the services, like appointment reminders, are applicable to both the LQ and the SQ space.", "So again, those services can be sold to doctors' offices. They can be sold to medical practices that are associated with hospitals. They could be sold to hospitals. So we kind of look at them combined now. But the Beryl acquisition was an important acquisition for us a couple years ago, and it's done well for us.", "Richard Close", "And how do you guys get paid on all this? Is it on a per call basis? Just help us out with that.", "Charles Alutto", "It varies, depending on the service. For instance, on an after-hour answering service, a typical contract would be set up as a flat monthly fee per physician per month. And for that, they'd get so many minutes. And if they go over that minutes, there is overcharges they get for time that was over, what was included in the standard contract.", "For a same service, let's call it a service like an appointment reminder service, there might be a flat monthly fee, again, per physician per month. And we make so many outbound calls, texts or e-mails, and again there is so much that are allotted to that monthly fee. Any overage would be charged extra at the end of the month. So it's a combination of a flat fee and a fee for volume.", "Richard Close", "So as we think about Communication Services, I understand that its large quantity and SQ are combined. But how do you go to market on the hospital side? How do you sell that product? Is it just following along with the waste side of things or how do you get into the hospital to sell that product?", "Brent Arnold", "We use kind of an account manager specialist model. So as we talked about last quarter, all of our account managers have been trained and certified to introduce this new service to all of our hospital customers, and we do that typically to our key decision makers during business reviews. They then pull in the specialist for Communication Solutions, and then they do a joint presentation of the overall benefits of the service for the account.", "Richard Close", "Earlier you talked about weather being $0.03 negative impact, and then there was something about seasonality being $0.02. So the combination of, I guess, those two of $0.05. What exactly is seasonality?", "Charles Alutto", "Rich, I kind of talked about it a little bit on our earlier question. I think it's tough to figure out how much is seasonality and how much is weather. So if we think back to the previous call when we're talking about PSC and now our Environmental Solutions business, we had discussed that the Environmental Solution business does experience seasonality in Q1.", "And seasonality is a function of volume and weather. But because there was severe weather in Q1, it resulted in a larger than anticipated reduction in volume in Environmental Solutions. We fully anticipate that will come back.", "To give you a little color there, just on the Environmental Solutions side, there was some of our operating locations that we lost one to two days of business per week for two months straight, where we were just non-productive. So we had in our estimate, in our guidance, we thought there will be some seasonality.", "The severe weather made seasonality worse. That's why we're saying so much is weather, so much might be seasonality. We think the two are integrated and are connected. And that's why I think the look at that is $0.05. And we think all of that is going to come back, obviously, as the weather improves throughout the year.", "Richard Close", "And then with respect to the international internal growth, can you comment a little bit more in terms of what exactly is driving that? Is that just, once you get these acquisitions integrated and in for a year, you're able to really just ramp up and expand the current services or is that more layering in maybe the Steri-Safe and the sharps and stuff on the international front as well?", "Brent Arnold", "I think you nailed it at the last part of that question. Additional services, they really follow the same model that we do in the States, where we build that customer relationship and then we introduce new services, whether that's on the SQ side, clinical services and continuing to expand that offering with our customers.", "We haven't talked about it in this call, but we mentioned it in the past, the dosimetry services have been a real hit for us in the Spain market and Portugal market or the biosystems, the additional services in those regard. So what we like to do is follow the same playbook in the U.S., which is build that customer relationship, add additional compliance services and continue to expand that relationship with our customers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Levine from Imperial Capital.", "Scott Levine", "Just a question on the RMS target. You're affirming the full year target, I believe, and came in at $20 million here for the quarter. Just traditionally with these large projects, I know are needle movers, I mean is there something with respect to the underlying business there that gives you the conviction in that target and/or do some of the recent acquisitions you've made? Maybe give you that confidence coming off of what looks like a somewhat light quarter operationally in RMS?", "Charles Alutto", "So Q1, we had a record number of new customers and a near record number of events. The revenue, as you see was up a little bit, it has to do with the acquisition we made, and that's more call center volume. So it does come in at a little lower margin. But I got to tell you, we're only three weeks into the second quarter, but we're doing really good. We're off to a great start there. And that's why we're confident to leave that guidance at $95 million to $120 million. So we feel really good about the start to Q2.", "Scott Levine", "And then, maybe as a follow-up. Just the leverage you're kind of trending down towards 2x and very active on the acquisition side. But is there a level at which you feel like the business is maybe underlevered? And maybe just some thoughts about whether you might look to get more active in deploying capital to create value if leverage bleeds below, say, 2x or just some thoughts around that?", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Yes, Scott. I think we've always felt very comfortable in the range to 2x to 2.5x. We certainly aren't going to spend money just for the sake of spending money. We continue to be very disciplined around our acquisitions. We have a very robust pipeline.", "And I wouldn't look at these from a quarter-to-quarter basis, really you got to look at the acquisitions that we do more on an annual basis. These things tend to come in surges. So we were good in the range there, and we feel very good about both our acquisition and our capital structure.", "Operator", "There are no further questions. I will turn the call back over to Sean McMillan.", "End of Q&A", "Sean McMillan", "Thank you, Amy. Well, we appreciate everyone taking time to participate on today's call. I want to remind everyone that this is Administrative Assistants Week, so if you've not already recognized those individuals that work so hard for you, often time behind the scenes, don't forget them.", "For the executive team at Stericycle, we want to thank Kelly, for everything she does to make us better.", "Have a great night. We look forward to seeing you out on the road in the next couple of months. Take care, guys.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.

My name is Blair, and I\u2019ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Stericycle Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Sean McMillan, VP of Corporate Finance, you may begin your conference.", "Sean McMillan", "Welcome to Stericycle\u2019s second quarter 2015 conference call. I will now read the Safe Harbor statement. This conference call may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control - for example, general economic and market conditions. Our actual results could differ significantly from the results described in the forward-looking statements.", "Factors that could cause such differences include changes in governmental regulation of the collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of regulated waste; increases in transportation and other operating costs; the level of governmental enforcement of regulations governing regulated waste collection and treatment; our ability to execute our acquisition strategy and to integrate acquired businesses; competition and demand for services in the regulated waste industry; political, economic and currency risks related to our foreign operations; impairments of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangibles; exposure to environmental liabilities; and compliance with existing and future legal and regulatory requirements, as well as other factors described in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "As a result, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results or trends. We make no commitment to disclose any subsequent revisions to forward-looking statements.", "I will now turn it over to Charlie Alutto, CEO.", "Charles Alutto", "Thank you, Sean. We are pleased to report our second quarter results. As expected, our business rebounded from the severe weather and seasonality we experienced in Q1. In addition, our recall and returns business had a very strong Q2, which included a record number of recalls handled in the quarter. All of our lines of business continued to perform well. Joining me on today\u2019s call to review our second quarter results will be Dan Ginnetti, CFO, and Brent Arnold, COO.", "I will now turn it over to Dan.", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Thank you, Charlie. The results for the second quarter are as follows. Revenues were $715.7 million, up 11.7% from $640.8 million in Q2 2014. Internal growth excluding returns and recall revenues was up 7.7%.", "Domestic revenues were $518.2 million of which $489.9 million was domestic regulated waste and client services, and $28.3 million was recalls and returns. Domestic internal growth, excluding recalls and returns revenues was up 6.6%, consisting of SQ up 8 and LQ up 5%.", "International revenues were $197.5 million, and internal growth adjusted for unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $27.3 million was up 10%. Acquisitions contributed $58.9 million to growth in the quarter.", "Gross profit was $305.3 million or 42.7% of revenues. SG&A expense including amortization was $135.7 million or 19% of revenues. Net interest expense was $16.4 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $60.5 million or $0.70 per share on an as-reported basis and $1.14 adjusted for acquisition-related expenses and other adjusted items.", "Now for the balance sheet. Our covenant debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.32 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of the revolver at the end of the quarter was approximately $685 million. In the quarter we repurchased 574,807 shares of common stock on the open market in an amount of $77.4 million. At the end of the quarter, we have authorization to purchase 4.1 million shares. Our CapEx was $25.4 million, our DSO was 66 days. Year-to-date as reported cash from operations was $178.7 million. When adjusted for recall reimbursement and one timers, cash from operations was $203.7 million.", "I will now turn it over to Brent.", "Brent Arnold", "Thanks, Dan. Worldwide we continue to use our strong free cash flow to drive our growth through acquisitions. In the quarter we closed eight acquisitions, six domestic and two international. The international acquisitions were in the Netherlands, which represents a new country for us and Canada.", "Revenues from the eight acquisitions were $10.1 million in the quarter and annualized are approximately $48.3 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies in lines of business.", "Last year we expanded our recall business with the acquisition of a company specializing in the automotive industry. Our combined capabilities allow us to offer our unique recall solution to the automotive sector. As a result, this contributed to a nice rebound in our recalls and returns business in the quarter.", "On the international front, our success in selling multiple services resulted in strong organic growth in the quarter. We have now fully launched the Sharps Management service in both Brazil and Chile. Now that this solution is available in these markets our customers can begin to enjoy the safety, compliance and sustainability benefits provided by the service offering.", "Looking ahead, we continue to see expanding growth opportunities as Stericycle provides multiple services to help our customers improve their operations and achieve their goals. As we execute on the strategy, we can more than triple our customer revenues.", "As you all know, last week Stericycle announced the acquisition of Shred-It International. This exciting new platform provides us an excellent opportunity to continue our organic growth, acquisitions, and international expansion for many years to come. We would like to thank all of the Shred-It and Stericycle team members for all of their hard work and dedication they've demonstrated in making this acquisition possible.", "I will now turn it over to Charlie.", "Charles Alutto", "Thank you, Brent. I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2015. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration, acquisition-related and other adjusting items.", "For 2015, we believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.64 to $4.69. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2015 will be in the range of $2.84 million to $2.88 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and impact from foreign exchange rates.", "We anticipate 2015 internal growth rates to be SQ 8% to 10%, LQ 5% to 8%, international 6% to 9%, and recall and returns revenues between $100 million to $115 million. We believe analysts will have estimates for 2015 free cash flow between $445 million to $456 million.", "2015 CapEx is anticipated to be between 96 million to 100 million. We expect a full-year as reported tax rate to be in the range of 34% to 34.5%.", "In closing, we are very pleased with our second quarter 2015 results and we remain excited about our multiple growth opportunities for 2015 and beyond. Thank you for your time today.", "We will now answer any questions. As a reminder please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question as necessary. Blair, you can now open the Q&A line.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We\u2019ll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels from William Blair. Your line is open.", "Ryan Daniels", "Yes, thanks for taking my question. Maybe I'll start with one on the LQ growth. I know it's been 5% at the low-end of guidance for a couple of quarters. And I'm curious if we should be thinking of that is kind of a more sustainable growth rate throughout the year if there's any initiatives you have on cross-selling or any new product launches that might skew that upwards a little bit as we start looking forward?", "Charles Alutto", "No, really no change to the guidance. Obviously, all I think the growth engines performed well, Ryan, both LQ and SQ. Keep in mind though, as we continue to have a headwind on fuel surcharges, that does bring down the growth rate again this quarter, roughly about 1% both LQ and SQ.", "So it's really more of a factor of the headwind associated with build to chart as we don't protect what fuel will do for the third and fourth quarters, so that's why the growth rates will remain the same for the rest of the year.", "Ryan Daniels", "Okay. Now that's helpful color. And then I guess Dan, my thought would be for you, just on gross margins could you talk a little bit about the bridge you sometimes provide and then any color on the absolute level I think might be just a touch below what we are modeling? Thanks.", "Daniel Ginnetti", "I'll first give you the bridge to Q-to-Q. So we are very pleased with our third straight quarter-over-quarter increase in gross margin. Our increase over Q1 was 25 basis points. So if you start with a Q1 gross margin of 42.4, the returns on the recall business rebounded from the weather and seasonality, and that increased our margin by about 55 basis points.", "Those more than offset the unfavorable impact of about 15 basis points from acquisition, and about 30 basis points due to our benefits related to healthcare claims. Our core business improved by about 16 basis points from efficiencies and slightly lower fuel expense. So our Q2 gross margin was 42.6.", "And I think you asked to compare that to your expectation, and I think if we look at the street models they were about 43.3%. And if you bridged it at acquisitions in the quarter were about 30 basis point headwind.", "Customer mix, both in our recall and our international business, unfavorably impacted us slightly by about 16 basis points. And then as I mentioned before, increases in our benefits related to healthcare claims were unfavorable by about 30 basis points. And then we saw some great improvements in the business of about 12 basis points over the expectation set in our prior guidance.", "Ryan Daniels", "Okay, perfect. Very helpful, thanks guys. I'll hop in the queue.", "Charles Alutto", "Thanks, Ryan.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Manthey from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.", "David Manthey", "Great. Thank you. On the change in the revenue outlook, I assume that's pretty standard acquisitions being offset by worsening FX. And can you put any numbers around the FX piece?", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Yeah, I think you're looking at the bridge to our revenue and the change in guidance there. And our previous guidance was about 2.81 to 2.86. But we had a really nice quarter. We beat the street estimate by about $7 million so we raised it by about $7 million there. The acquisitions that we completed in Q2 will contribute about $24 million to the year. And then we slightly narrowed the recall guidance by raising up the bottom end, and then we lowered the top end each at about $5 million. So new guidance is 100 to 115 and that gives you the 2.84 to 2.88 guidance. ", "Charles Alutto", "So there really was no impact from foreign exchange on the guidance going from this point forward, David. ", "David Manthey", "Okay. And then second, I guess it's a little over a year since the acquisition of PSC with synergies and accretion up to your expectations. Could you talk at all about the year-to-year growth rate that you saw in the combined PSC strong pack LTE has waste business this quarter? ", "Charles Alutto", "Yeah, I think as you said I mean we came across the one year mark on the last quarter, integrations went really well. From a growth rate perspective, they are really in line with the overall growth rates of the business. Certainly it\u2019s an additional service that adds to both LQ and SQ. So it\u2019s a contributor to both the LQ growth, the size of that 6% to 8%, 8% to 10% growth and the LQ of the 5% to 8% growth.", "So it's growing nicely. It's a lot of SQ work that we get; we do have some project work that's included in there. And I think overall, though, the good news there is we saw a lot of seasonality and weather impacting that business in Q1, and it came back like we thought in Q2. So they performed really well in the quarter. ", "David Manthey", "Great, thank you. ", "Charles Alutto", "Thanks, David.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.", "Al Kaschalk", "Good afternoon everybody.", "Charles Alutto", "Hi, Al.", "Al Kaschalk", "Yes. Just a question here, more maybe philosophical. The recalls and returns business is actually increasingly becoming a small piece. I was wondering why, or perhaps are we going to see some additional disclosure or guidance on some of the other service lines, particularly what we just talked about on the industrial side business? ", "Charles Alutto", "Yes, I think when you think about our other businesses, it gets hard to break those out because we share so many of the resources in that business. So we have operational synergies, back-office synergies that we use and support that business, a lot of shared services where the recall business kind of from an operational perspective does operate independently, Al, and that's why it's always kind of been reported out.", "One of the reasons why that's been reported out separately, so right now there is no plans to report out other segments of the business. We do get some recall outside of the U.S. but it's not material and those numbers get reported into the specific countries in our international results. ", "Al Kaschalk", "Okay. And my follow-up then, the automotive has actually been a good market. I noticed that the number of recalls you had was a record number, but the dollar level still is pretty low. So how should we be thinking about the -- your direction on this particular segment, and then both domestically or North America? And then, obviously there's fairly growing market opportunity in places outside of North America.", "Charles Alutto", "Yes. I think the revenue number actually was really good, Al. It was 28.3 for the quarter. That's the highest it's been in the previous \u2013 for the six quarters. So, certainly, that is a good number, a nice rebound over Q1 which is at $20 million.", "As far as the auto sector, as Brent mentioned in his comments, we did a small acquisition in 2014 that gave us exposure to that sector. Matching the -- and leveraging those relationships with our call center capabilities, it obviously provides our customers now with a unique solution and we believe the sector is an opportunity for both our customers and Stericycle.", "If you think about our capabilities, we used to serve \u2013 we were serving the pharmaceutical industry, the medical device industry, consumer products and the food and beverage industry. We really weren't exposed to the automotive sector. Now by having that exposure to that sector, if you think about a recall event now in the U.S. really for that matter in any part of the world, we have that experience and the exposure now to all of the sectors. It really rounded out our service offering and the team put up a great number in Q2 at the 28.3 million level, which was a nice improvement over Q1. And like I said the biggest number we put up in that space since beyond 2014 -- before 2014.", "Al Kaschalk", "Thank you.", "Charles Alutto", "Thanks Al.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman from Stifel. Your line is open.", "Brian Butler", "This is Brian Butler in for Michael.", "Charles Alutto", "Hi, Brian.", "Brian Butler", "Hello. Just wanted to ask one on the working capital side, could you talk about that in the quarter? It looked like DSOs were up a little bit and working capital was fairly high, and how to think about that in the second half and where you end the year?", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Yes. So, as we mentioned before, we had an incredibly strong revenue period, in fact our growth quarter-over-quarter was up $52.3 million. And so when you look at our DSO, about two days of it went up, which was attributed to the growth in the quarter that really came in the latter half of the quarter and in areas that do have slightly higher DSO. We had a one-day impact which is really timing of adding acquisition to the balance sheet. They don't always coincide with the new revenue coming in. But we remain focused on this area. We really believed it will come back by the end of the year. And we\u2019ve maintained our free cash flow guidance as a result of that.", "So, I think what you're going to see is the working capital that's been a strength of this company, no change to the guidance, and we'll continue to put it to work with the acquisition share repos or maintaining our debt levels.", "Brian Butler", "Okay. And then a quick follow-up on growth, just domestically on the SQ. Can you given any color on the breakdown kind of between what is the incremental services you're selling to current customers versus kind of new customers?", "Charles Alutto", "Sure, Brian. This is Charlie. SQ growth as we always \u2013 as we\u2019ve stated in our guidance is 8% to 10% growth there really hasn't been a significant change to those contribution to those growth rates. Again, about 40% to 50% of that organic growth is related to price and volume. And then 50% to 60% of that, so the remainder of that growth is in the additional services, whether that's Steri-Safe, hazardous-waste disposal, Communication Solutions, they all contribute to the SQ growth.", "Brian Butler", "Great. Thank you.", "Charles Alutto", "Thanks, Brian.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Thanks, good afternoon. Going back to RMS, could you speak a little bit more about that the auto acquisition and what actually are the \u2013 is the auto activity recall activity you're seeing? And then is that passing through and active here at the end of the quarter and end of July? And beyond that, what else in RMS is it still active, is the trend strong into the third quarter? Thanks.", "Charles Alutto", "Sure. This was a small acquisition in 2014. They had some capabilities in items related to recalls in the auto. They did not have a call center capability. So really when you say where are we taking it now, we\u2019re taking it more as you know, Scott, we got great capabilities in call center, not only in our communication solutions, but also in our recall and returns division.", "So it's taking that and leveraging those relationships over those capabilities that we have. It certainly contributed to the growth in Q2, I wouldn't say that we had other contributors as well, we had a record number of recalls for the quarter. We are building momentum in the auto sector, and we do anticipate that that momentum will continue for the remainder of the year.", "Obviously we brought up the low-end of the guidance, we\u2019re still missing some of those multiple blockbuster acquisitions and that's why we brought the top end down a bit. But we think the momentum especially in the auto sector will continue for the rest of 2015.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Thanks. A couple more. Still on the acquisition topic, you had eight total, six U.S., two international, Dutch Canada, could you talk about what they were LQ SQ, other in U.S. and international please?", "Charles Alutto", "Yes. As you mentioned there were six domestic, two international. There were six in the compliance services, two in consult [ph]. The split of the rev SQ LQ is about 35% SQ, 65% LQ.", "Scott Schneeberger", "The comp saw both in U.S., I assume? ", "Charles Alutto", "No, there was one in U.S., one in international.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Okay, thanks. And lastly, just if I could sneak one in on tax rate, it was a little lower than we had anticipated in the quarter, the guides 34 to 34.5. Just I guess we can back into what second half looks like now, but just thoughts on bumpingness in tax rate. ", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Yes. So, it's a great question, Scott. The guided tax rate for the quarter was in fact 35.5 to 36. And while you did see an as-reported tax rate of 33.6, this was primarily a result of a large settlement that we had discussed and done an 8-K earlier on in the quarter. When you adjust for the settlement, the tax rate in the quarter is actually 35.5% right in line with guidance. And so as a result we got no EPS benefit on our adjusted EPS that we reported. Going forward in Q3 I think still the 35.5 to 36 rate is a good rate to hold and based on the benefit that we saw in Q1, that would give you an annual tax rate of about 34 to 34.5.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Jay Hanna", "Hi. This is Jay Hanna in for Gary.", "Charles Alutto", "Hey, Jay.", "Jay Hanna", "Hey. What do you guys expect to be the real driver to increase your cash EPS from 2016 and 2018, is it going to include debt reduction and lock on M&A?", "Charles Alutto", "Yes, I'm glad that you brought up the cash EPS, and obviously we talked about that on the PSC or on the Shred-It call that we had and the acquisition coming up. And really by eliminating that deal related amortization we think it better represents our operating performance. Really all that we are doing is we are taking out the amortization, and then in that.", "And so the growth in our EPS really goes back to the core fundamentals of our business, continuing to be able to have strong revenue growth, sell across multiple lines of service, execute on synergies and efficiencies, and that will really drive the accretion you're looking for. I want to make sure it's the question that you are asking because we talk about cash EPS. Some people believe its -- our cash flow per share, and that's not the cash EPS that we are referring to. More often you are seeing cash EPS is nothing different than the adjusted EPS that we report, and then removing the deal related amortization.", "Jay Hanna", "Right, no, we understand that. How do you feel about synergies driving that going forward as well?", "Brent Arnold", "Hey, Jay, this is Brent. There is really two categories of synergies that we are looking at. First there's the Cintas synergy, as Shred-It acquired Cintas back in 2014. They're doing really well with regards to achieving those through Q1 they are 29% of the way home. Keep in mind too, they had two different operating systems and whenever you have that it makes it hard to accomplish certain synergies until you get on the same platform.", "I'm happy to report that all of their locations now are on SAP. So things like route density, moving customers from on-site shredding to off-site shredding to their facilities which are actually under capacity, which will be a nice pickup for us as we use that available capacity. All those things will contribute to growing our overall EBITDA.", "Jay Hanna", "Okay, thank you. And one more quick question, how much of the revenue lost last quarter from bad weather did you guys get back in Q2?", "Charles Alutto", "Yes, I would say we got back everything. We talked about weather, and weather-related seasonality again, a new phenomenon with us with the PSC acquisition. We feel like we've made both the weather and the seasonality in this quarter, Jay.", "Jay Hanna", "All right. Thank you.", "Charles Alutto", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sean Dodge from Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Sean Dodge", "Good afternoon, thanks. The returns and recall business, can you give us a sense of the size of the fixed cost space there, and how quickly can you flex that up and down as you go through periods we have a few events and then quarters like this where you have many?", "Charles Alutto", "Yes, I think we talked about it before. The fixed cost the team has done a really good job. The fixed cost is more involved in the facilities, the call center facility that we have also the warehouse space that we have, and we take product back. When we start to get to the low 20s or high teens, it's hard to make up that fixed cost. So we saw that was a driver of margins down in Q3, Q4 and a little bit in Q1 of this year. Then once we get past those low 20s, millions that is in revenue those fixed costs now are covenant and obviously additional margins on that.", "So when you talk about other cost going up there, the variable cost is more labor. It\u2019s the retrieval labor that we have of independent contractors that go out and grab the product or the nonperforming assets, if the call center agents that we have a large influx of call-center work, but I will tell you that high -- when he gets to the low 20s, it's tough to cover that those fixed costs, and then the customer mix obviously would also impact the gross margin as well.", "Sean Dodge", "Okay. And then your international segment is comprised of multiple countries that are all in various stages of being built out. What\u2019s roughly the difference in margins between the most mature markets and some of your newer ones? And are any of the margins in your foreign markets approaching that of the United States? ", "Brent Arnold", "Well Sean, this is Brent. Overall from an international margin perspective, as you know its greater LQ than SQ, so the good news is there LQ margins are higher in international than our share domestically. But overall that provides a challenge for them. We are always working to improve the SQ/LQ mix, and one of the main ways we do that is through our Clinical Services. This quarter we actually had a really good Clinical Services performance that helps bring more margins to our business and helps to grow that.", "And we are always focused on different types of acquisitions, new services that will continue to drive our margin. Another good example of that would be our Dosimetry business that we got in Spain and Portugal. So again, there may be a little lower than we like, but I think we are focused on raising them and a lot of that will come from SQ business. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten from Macquarie. Your line is open.", "Adam Baumgarten", "Hey guys, can you just give an update on the comp sell platform and how that's going and should we expect as that rolls out you guys accelerating acquisitions on that front? ", "Charles Alutto", "Yes Adam, it\u2019s Charlie. The Shred-it connected to our new operating platform for communication solution business; it's on track and will be completed at the end of the year. We now have production clients on Shred-it, connect [ph] today and we are adding new clients every week. We also are ramping up to have all of our call answering services clients on the new platform by the end of 2016.", "We said this previously this new platform obviously provides better quality calls and will also come with operational efficiencies, but are not available with the current legacy systems we are operating. I think the team -- kudos to the team of doing a really great job they are really focused on -- they were focused on the development and now focused on the deployment. And we really excited about that platform.", "And that will help us obviously integrate faster, so once we have the platform set, we have all the customers on it that really gives us the confidence from a sales perspective, but also from an acquisition and integration standpoint as well.", "Adam Baumgarten", "Great, thanks. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Barbara Noverini from Morningstar. Your line is open. ", "Barbara Noverini", "Hey, good afternoon everybody.", "Charles Alutto", "Hey Barbara.", "Barbara Noverini", "Can you comment on whether there are any operational synergy between recalls and returns and PSC Environmental? Specifically I'm thinking about retail pharmacy, perhaps pharmaceutical returns, have those entities been able to share resources or access or are there operation still really need to exclude those? ", "Charles Alutto", "Well actually that's how we got into the business. We are in recalls and returns, Barbara as you know, since 2005. And what really spearheaded us into it is that team had done an acquisition of the company called strong environmental, gave us additional capabilities for some hazardous waste offerings, also gave us some capabilities on the LQ side. But they had a business called StrongPak.", "We had the relationships, we meaning Recalls and Returns have the relationships with retailers and that's really the team that built that business up for us which led us to the PSC acquisition. We've done a really good job on the sales and marketing side of that business. But we were lacking in the operational infrastructure. And as you know one of the main attractions of Stericycle to PSC was that operational infrastructure that they brought to us.", "So there were synergies there. There were opportunities to leverage relationships and we continue to leverage those types of relationships really across all of our businesses today.", "Barbara Noverini", "Got it. So if that's the case, then why do you actually break out recall and returns? Why is that not [indiscernible] one into the other?", "Charles Alutto", "Because operationally they are separate. We do leverage the relationships there, but we do run that separately. There is not a lot of operational synergy. When you go and pick up a retail pharmacy for whether it be medical waste or whether it's reoccurring hazardous waste or former StrongPak, which is now part of environmental solutions, we leverage that operational infrastructure.", "And then Recall tends to be lumpy and uneven business. That's one of the good reasons why we've always kind of called it out. From a shareholder perspective, they get clarity over that number. So, but we don't share operational infrastructure. They are two separate businesses. ", "Barbara Noverini", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Charles Alutto", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Isaac Ro", "Good afternoon. Hi, guys.", "Charles Alutto", "Hey, Isaac.", "Isaac Ro", "First, I just wanted to start off with one more on recall and returns. I\u2019m just trying to figure out if there would be any sort of follow-through from the current upside this quarter that you guide into 3Q and 4Q. I kind of looked at sort of the range by which you raise your guidance for that business versus kind of where your numbers came out on total top line versus consensus. And it seemed like there might be a couple million dollars of wiggle room. So I'm just trying to figure out what to assume for 3Q and if there's anything in 4Q as well.", "Charles Alutto", "Yes. It's always a lumpy business. The team would tell you they get frustrated because it's really hard to predict quarter to quarter. We do think, though -- we feel good about the second half of the year. I think it's more related to the auto sector where we continue to gain momentum, and that's why we feel good about the second half of the year.", "And really the record number of events in Q2, we've always said some of the things that we look at are signs of are we on the right track. We continue to have a record number of events. Some of them are small, but we know that those large blockbuster events will eventually come.", "And if we continue to gain market share and get people to rather than do it themselves but to outsource it to Stericycle that we really have a good chance to build momentum in that space. So it\u2019s, again, very tough to predict, but we do feel good about the second half of the year.", "Isaac Ro", "Got it. So it sounds like it's sort of the lumpiness, not any one contract or a couple big ones there.", "Charles Alutto", "Not at all very lumpy, not really, it's one contract.", "Isaac Ro", "Okay. Helpful. And maybe just one follow-up on the tax rate. It looked like your guidance came down a little bit for the year. I wasn't sure why that was, and if you could put any color on that. Thank you.", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Yeah. Actually the tax rate guidance is for Q3. It remains the same. The annual number is really an impact of the lower tax rate that we experienced in Q1, which was a result of some consolidation of entities and some one-time tax benefits. So the tax rate as I mentioned this quarter, when you normalize it for the litigation settlement, came in at exactly where we estimated it to be. And we think Q3 we will be about the same.", "And the reason also it was slightly higher has to do with foreign exchange impact and some of the lower revenues internationally, which is lower tax rate countries. And so that's why we kind of pushed up both in Q2, and subsequently in Q3 and into the rest of the year at the higher end of 35.5 to 37.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason Rogers from Great Lakes Review. Your line is open.", "Jason Rogers", "Good afternoon.", "Charles Alutto", "Hey, Jason.", "Jason Rogers", "I apologize if I missed this, but did you give the total number of accounts large Q and small Q?", "Brent Arnold", "Hey, Jason this is Brent. The total overall accounts are 610,000 and from an SQ perspective, 588,000 were SQ, the remainder were large. ", "Jason Rogers", "And you talked about Shred-It being on an SAP system, is Stericycle on the same system, and what's the process of combining the two? ", "Charles Alutto", "You know, right now Stericycle is not on that operating system. We\u2019ll -- it's too early to tell what system we ultimately go to, to run the combined business. Obviously we have a lot on the line with the Cintas Shred-It synergy. So we want the team to focus on that, no decision has been made on the ultimate system. We're going to learn over the next coming months more about the SAP system. As Brent kind of said in his comments that was critical for a lot of those synergies was to get the former Cintas business on the Shred-It SAP platform. ", "Jason Rogers", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Steinke from Barrington Research. Your line is open.", "Kevin Steinke", "Good afternoon. I just wanted to make sure I understood that EPS guidance bridge here $4.64 to $4.69 in line with the previous guidance and the revenue guidance came up a little bit, just if you could give that bridge? ", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Yeah, sure, happy to do that. So the prior guidance, as you know was $4.64 to $4.69. We had $0.03 of improvement that we expect to happen in the back half of the year in EPS from acquisitions. And the interest that you will see at a reduced rate for the rest of the year but those will be offset by some of the increases that we talked about in healthcare benefits, and then remember we did lower the top end guidance on recall.", "So as a result, the guidance remained unchanged at 4.64 to 4.69. And just for those of you that are kind of anticipating the change to a cash EPS, the equivalent would be 4.90 to 4.95. And I think if you kind of building this out ramping up from $1.18 in Q3 and then so on out of your models is probably the best approach.", "Kevin Steinke", "Okay. Great, thank you. And then when you announce the Shred-it acquisition, you talked about 52 million of remaining synergies from the combination with primarily with the Cintas business.", "Now that they're both on the same SAP platform, do you see them working down a meaningful chunk of that 52 million of synergies within the next three to four months before you close the deal? And then post-close, what's the timeframe for getting whatever is remaining?", "Charles Alutto", "Overall our plan is to have by the end of this year we hope to have 50% of the synergize -- the synergies realized of that remaining 52 million, and then over the course of the next year we hope to get all the projects completed to get 100%. But realize some of that will bleed into 2017, so while the projects will wrap up in 2016, the financial impact will bleed over in 2017.", "Brent Arnold", "Just to clarify a little bit, the total synergy between Cintas and Shred-it was in the low 70s, 72, and by the end of the year it will be 50% of that 72 million Kevin, and the remainder will be realized into 2016.", "Daniel Ginnetti", "And just a clarity. The total overall was 73, they had 21 realized already, 52 is remaining through 2017.", "Operator", "There are no further audio questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters.", "Sean McMillan", "Great. Thanks, Blair. We appreciate everyone taking time to participate on today's call and the continued support of our long-time shareholders. Enjoy the rest of the summer; we'll see everybody on the road later this quarter. Have a great evening. Thanks everybody.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.

My name is Dan and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Stericycle Third Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to VP of Corporate Finance, Sean McMillan. Please go ahead.", "Sean McMillan", "Welcome to Stericycle's third quarter 2015 conference call. I will now read the Safe Harbor statement. This conference call may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control -- for example, general economic and market conditions. Our actual results could differ significantly from the results described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences include changes in governmental regulation of the collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of regulated waste; increases in transportation and other operating costs, the level of governmental enforcement of regulations governing recommended waste, collection and treatment; our ability to execute our acquisition strategy and to integrate acquired businesses; competition and demand for services in the regulated waste industry; political, economic and currency risks related to our foreign operations; impairments of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangibles; exposure to environmental liabilities; compliance with existing and future legal and regulatory requirements; as well as other factors described in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "As a result, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance. Investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results or trends. We make no commitment to disclose any subsequent revisions to forward-looking statements. I will now turn it over to Charlie Alutto, CEO.", "Charlie Alutto", "Thank you for joining us on today's call. In the third quarter, our results were unfavorably impacted by the following key factors, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, lower hazardous-waste volume from our industrial customers and some higher-than-anticipated expenses in certain lines of business.", "Although we're disappointed with the results and the third quarter, the long-term fundamentals of the Company remain strong. We're encouraged by our continued success in selling additional services to our existing customer base and are growing the recall solutions business.", "Furthermore, we're very excited about the future growth provided by the recent Shred-It acquisition. Joining me on today's call to review our third quarter results will be Dan Ginnetti, CFO; and Brent Arnold, COO. I will now turn it over to Dan.", "Dan Ginnetti", "Thank you, Charlie. The results for the third quarter are as follows. Revenues were $718.6 million, up 7.6% from $667.9 million in Q3 2014; and internal growth, excluding returns and recall revenues, was up 6.3%. Domestic revenues were $523.5 million, of which $493.2 million was domestic regulated waste in compliance services and $30.3 million was recalls and returns. Domestic internal growth, excluding recalls and returns revenues, was up 6%, consisting of SQ up 7% and LQ up 4%. Growth rates were unfavorably impacted by lower fuel surcharges and lower hazardous-waste volumes from our industrial customers.", "International revenues were $195.1 million. And internal growth, adjusted for unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $33 million, was up 8%. This growth rate was also unfavorably impacted by lower hazardous-waste volume. Acquisitions contributed $33.3 million to growth in the quarter. Gross profit was $299.7 million or 41.7% of revenues. SG&A expense including amortization was $138 million or 19.2% of revenues.", "Net interest expense was $17.4 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $41.8 million or $0.47 per share on an as-reported basis and $1.08 when adjusted for acquisition-related expenses and other adjustments, including the recent legal settlement.", "Now for the balance sheet. Our covenant debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.17 at the end of the quarter which includes the equity from the recent mandatory convertible preferred issuance. The unused portion of the revolver at the end of the quarter was approximately $875 million. In the quarter we repurchased 88,376 shares of common stock on the open market in an amount of $11.9 million. At the end of the quarter, we have authorization to purchase 4 million shares.", "Our CapEx was $25.8 million. Our DSO was 67 days. Year-to-date reported cash from operations was $293 million. When adjusted for recall reimbursement and other items, cash from operations was $353 million. I will now turn it over to Brent.", "Brent Arnold", "Thanks, Dan. The quarter we closed 10 acquisitions, three domestic and seven international. The international acquisitions were three in South Korea, two in Spain and two in Romania. Revenues from the 10 acquisitions were $2.2 million in the quarter and annualized are approximately $14.3 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust, with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business.", "In the quarter we experienced a solid growth in selling additional services to our existing customer base. This growth came from retail hazardous waste, sharps management, pharmaceutical waste and communication solutions. For example, we're seeing increased adoption of our pharmaceutical waste service by physician practices. By utilizing our existing customer relationships along with our environmental solutions infrastructure, we're able to deliver a simple and cost-effective service that keeps our customers compliant and helps protect the environment.", "We also experienced solid growth in our recall and return business. The combination of our recall expertise and the relationships in the automotive sector are creating many opportunities. The team has done a terrific job of flexing up our call center capacity to meet the demands of several large engagements. This has resulted in our best recall and returns quarter in the past three years.", "On October 1 we closed the Shred-It acquisition. The acquisition team is off to a quick start, driving operational synergies and laying the groundwork for long-term growth. Today less than 20% of our existing Stericycle customers utilize Shred-It for secure information destruction services. This acquisition provides another value-added service for our customers and an exciting growth opportunity for Stericycle.", "We would like to take this opportunity to welcome the Shred-It team members to our Stericycle family. Additionally, we thank all of our worldwide team members for their continued commitment to our customers, our shareholders and our values. I will now turn it over to Charlie.", "Charlie Alutto", "Thanks, Brent. I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2015 and preliminary guidance for 2016. Please keep in mind these are forward-looking statements and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration, acquisition-related and other adjusted items. The current 2015 and preliminary 2016 guidance also includes the recently closed Shred-It acquisition, the related increase in share count and the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar.", "For 2015, we believe analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.38 to $4.41. We believe that analyst revenue estimates for 2015 will be approaching $3 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and negative impact from foreign exchange rates.", "We anticipate 2015 internal growth rates to be, SQ, 7% to 9%; LQ 4% to 7%; international, 7% to 9%; and recall and return revenues between $100 million and $110 million. We believe analysts will have estimates for 2015 free cash flow between $417 million to $426 million. 2015 CapEx is anticipated to be between $104 million to $110 million. We expect the full-year as-reported tax rate to be approximately 33.5% to 34%. This assumes the tax rate for the remainder of the year to be approximately 36%.", "Now I would like to provide preliminary guidance for 2016. As a reminder, in 2016 we will be reporting on a cash EPS basis. For modeling purposes, our 2015 EPS guidance of $4.38 to $4.41 is equivalent to $4.69 to $4.72 on a cash EPS basis. For 2016 we believe that analyst cash EPS estimates will be in the range of $5.28 to $5.35, using a share count of approximately 92 million which we're comfortable with.", "For comparative purposes, when 2015 cash EPS is normalized for tax rates and foreign exchange impact, this represents a cash EPS growth rate of approximately 17%. We believe analyst revenue estimates for 2016 will be in the range of $3.65 billion to $3.72 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and negative impact from foreign exchange rates.", "We anticipate 2016 internal growth rates to be, SQ, 7% to 9%; LQ, 4% to 7%; international, 6% to 9%; and recall and returns revenues between $95 million to $120 million. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow in 2016 between $470 million to $485 million. 2016 CapEx is anticipated to be between $125 million to $140 million. We expect the 2016 full-year as-reported tax rate to be approximately 36%.", "In closing, although disappointed with the results in Q3, we're confident about the long-term fundamentals of our business and remain excited about the growth opportunities in 2016 and beyond. Thank you for your time today. We will now answer any questions. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, as necessary. Dan, you can now open the queue.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels. Your line is now open. ", "Ryan Daniels", "Maybe the first one I can ask you to provide a bridge from the $1.18 you were thinking about for earnings per share in Q3 to what you reported, maybe highlighting the haz waste impact and then higher expenses? And perhaps a little color on what those both were?", "Dan Ginnetti", "Sure, let me help you with that. So the estimates out there were $1.19, anywhere from $1.18 to $1.19. Our guidance was $1.18. There's about $0.01 difference between that. We saw a $0.025 headwind from the additional equity and the continued FX impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar. The slower-than-anticipated worldwide project work, along with the shift in customer mix in the recall business, created about a $0.05 headwind. SG&A investments and growth drivers, some higher professional fees and some higher-than-anticipated cost of revenues contributed to about $0.025 of that miss. And that is how you would get to $1.08.", "Ryan Daniels", "Okay. And then I guess my follow-up would be just looking at the cash EPS guidance for 2016. If we're assuming $0.10 accretion for Shred-It, so $0.47 cash EPS on the $470 million midpoint this year, it looks like the core business EPS growth is going to be pretty muted next year. So can you talk a little bit about that? Maybe I am doing some of the math wrong, but any color there?", "Dan Ginnetti", "Let me help you a little bit with the math and then I think Charlie can add a little bit of color to the future growth. When you look at the equivalent cash EPS that Charlie provided you from all-in purposes, that was the $4.69 to the $4.72 -- again, this year on from a cash perspective, we had two large legal settlements which significantly lowered our tax rate.", "We also had some great entity consolidation that we did earlier in the year which provided a much lower tax rate. So when you normalize for that tax going to the 36%, because we don't expect those are going to replicate, that is about a $0.12 difference.", "Also, the continued foreign expense or foreign exchange escalation throughout the year is about another $0.04. So when you normalize for that, you would look at about a $4.53 to a $4.56 -- on average, $4.55. And what that provides you is about a 16 to 17.5, probably 17 at the middle, year-over-year growth.", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes, I think another way to look at it, Ryan and obviously, we're being conservative with our guidance and that is related to the strengthening dollar, the reduction in the industrial waste volumes and further investments in the long-term growth engines. This guidance will allow the Stericycle management team to focus on those areas that provide predictable revenues and outcomes. And these areas include environmental solutions, Shred-It, communication solutions, as well as our medical waste and compliance services. If the industrial waste volumes rebound, that will be an addition to our strong growth that we're experiencing in the overall business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman. Your line is now open. ", "Michael Hoffman", "Well, I guess I am flummoxed which doesn't happen very often. The forecast seems about $100 million to $150 million light to me on the revenues, when you think about you're ending this year at about $3 billion and there is -- $725 million is the number that was in the presentation for Shred-It. And you have got to grow the $3 billion and $725 million has got to grow. So help me gap that difference.", "Charlie Alutto", "Well, I think when you look at it, we think that -- Michael, first of all, we think some of the industrial waste weakness that we've seen in Q3 is going to continue on and probably accelerate a little bit more in Q4. So we're being very conservative on the industrial waste. If you think about our industrial waste part of the business, we've got about $125 million to $200 million of our regulated waste services that we feel is directly related to project or industrial waste business.", "So we think that slowdown which we saw accelerate in Q3, is going to actually get worse in Q4 and then level off in 2016. Then we had the additional effect of the foreign exchange. Dan can walk you some of those bridges, but we certainly have the additional foreign exchange headwind that not only affected us this quarter, but if we were to use this rate going forward which we do, it has an impact going into 2016 as well.", "Michael Hoffman", "So just to be clear, out of your roughly $520 million of hazardous waste, $125 million to $200 million is project-based and you see that number becoming what?", "Charlie Alutto", "We think a number for next year will be -- well, for next quarter it could be down anywhere between $14 million to $20 million -- $18 million to $20 million. And we were impacted roughly by about $8 million to $10 million in this quarter. So if you take that weakness that we were showing and Q4 and you take that out into 2016, that right there is anywhere between $60 million to $70 million.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Manthey. Your line is now open. ", "David Manthey", "I guess here, too, I am wondering on the gross margin -- maybe you could break that apart a little bit. Some of the items that you mentioned here in terms of SG&A, investment and professional fees -- clearly those are more SG&A related. And on the GP, we've never really seen a drop like this. Is it that the profitability of this industrial waste is much higher than average? Or it's just a lack of absorption? What the underlying cause of that -- of the gross margin weakness?", "Dan Ginnetti", "Sure, David. I'll tell you what, why don't I start with the bridge and I will add a little bit of color to that. So Q2 gross margins were 42.66%. We did have some acquisitions, but the impact of that was offset directly with foreign exchange. We did have 40 basis points of unfavorable impact that came from the lower-than-expected project work. And we had some higher-than-anticipated cost revenues about 51 basis points of unfavorability.", "What those were, David, since you asked about them, those were redirection of waste flows required from two facility fires; payroll adjustment required by unions due to inflation in two Latin American countries; we've experienced some higher operational costs from running our newly compliant Title V incinerators.", "Regarding the project work, yes, that does come out at higher. We have a certain amount of -- a significant amount of fixed costs that are tied to the industry and when revenue comes in, we're able to leverage those resources and go at them.", "We do have a plan going forward that Charlie will talk about on how to maybe flex that a little bit. But when that revenue comes off, we have to maintain the integrity of our fixed costs in our fleet to be able to continue to service that reoccurring business.", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes, I think as Dan said, David, the current fixed cost structure in environmental solutions, coupled with that unexpected lower revenues, unfavorably impacted revenues. I think the biggest question is, what are we going to do to mitigate that in the future?", "Well, we're certainly going to implement plans to reduce those fixed costs within the business. If you think back, this is very similar to our approach and success we had in our recall business, where they solely have a business based on project work. So we do need to mitigate that in the future by lowering those fixed costs on our environmental solutions side of the business.", "David Manthey", "Okay. And then on the SQ, LQ and international, unless I missed something, it seems like you adjusted those ranges. Is that correct or did I miss something here?", "Dan Ginnetti", "No, you are correct on that. The growth engines performed well when we looked at it from an additional services perspective. But certainly we had headwinds related to fuel surcharges and those hazardous waste volumes. So we have adjusted the domestic LQ and SQ growth rates for 2015 and 2016, based on our assumption that the headwinds which we've outlined, will remain -- will be in effect for 2015 and remain for 2016 as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee. Your line is now open. ", "Gary Bisbee", "Let me add to that. The industrial waste and project work, can you give us a little more color, exactly what that is? I assume that came through PSC and was not something you built organically. But it begs the question, is that really something we should be in, given what seems like pretty -- essentially volatile? In two out of three quarters, this was a factor that led to a miss.", "Charlie Alutto", "So our Q3 industrial waste volumes worldwide were less than we anticipated. And, Gary, that includes project work and lower volumes from the industrial waste customers. Obviously, we feel the shortfall on the projects and these volumes are directly related to the drop in energy and commodity prices. And I think you kind of said it, that we've acquired assets over the last several years that included industrial waste customers. And these customers and volumes are now included in our base business.", "So certainly from a guidance perspective, since we thought that this pressure would not only continue but get slightly worse for the remainder of 2015, level out in 2016, that is why we took it out of our guidance in 2015 and for 2016. But it's -- certainly the acquisitions we made were a portion of the business inside there.", "You're absolutely right about that should not be our focus. All along we have talked about building an SQ reoccurring revenue model. We're certainly going to do that. We will look at that with a little more gusto now that we have seen that project work fluctuate more than we would like.", "We saw it fluctuate in Q1. It came back in Q2. We thought we were going to be right there in Q3 and Q4. So this told us obviously it builds during the quarter. But the focus will be over time. It's a transition -- it's project and industrial waste work which is not our core focus, to a more SQ reoccurring revenue model -- for instance, like Steri-Safe for hazardous waste customers.", "Gary Bisbee", "And then the follow-up question, just on Shred-It, can you -- within that guidance, I realize you may not break it down in a detailed fashion going forward, but can you give us a sense what is implied for Shred-It, whether that is on the revenue line or the EBITDA line? Or just give us -- help us get to this new guidance. Frame what's in there for Shred-It.", "Dan Ginnetti", "Sure, Gary. I think when you are modeling for 2016, about $716 million is an appropriate range. Looking at their EBIT and I would urge you to look at us from an EBIT perspective as well -- as we transition Shred-It which was a Canadian-owned Company, over to U.S. GAAP, IFRS to GAAP requires some changes.", "So you will see potentially some movement within gross margin and SG&A. But EBIT should be consistent. So I would model it about 16.7% for their EBIT. The depreciation in their model and amortization is about $56 million depreciation and $30 million amortization. And then figure about $35 million to $45 million in interest.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger. Your line is now open. ", "Scott Schneeberger", "You just mentioned on the last question that the hidden industrial waste came on quickly; it caught you a little off guard. Could you take us a little bit more in depth into what exactly happened? What exactly is it? And you are speaking to stabilization in 2016. Could you elaborate a little bit on -- you know, it is going to get worse in fourth quarter from third? Stable in fourth quarter? Please kind of speak to what happened and what gives you the outlook of stabilization next year?", "Dan Ginnetti", "Yes, so I think just so I paint the picture clear, we had obviously an impact in Q3. We think that impact boded slightly worse in Q4. And then it will stay at that level into 2016. So it will stay at that low level. That's at least from a guidance perspective. And we might prove out to be too conservative on that, but we think it's prudent to have that view of the business at this point.", "To give you an example, Scott, on what do we mean by that type of work -- I will give you kind of two examples. And I think if you think through, as I said before, although we don't directly work with energy or mining companies, many of our customers do work for these industries. So the rate of decline, when we look at these customers, was much faster than we anticipated. And it declined rapidly in the quarter.", "So two examples I think we look at, we have been some servicing a customer for several years that provides generators to the oil and gas industry. This customer provided very steady volumes over the last several years. Their business was down by over 70% when we look at that specific example Q3 year-over-year.", "Another example, we had a contract with a customer that provides equipment cleaning services for the energy in the mining industry. In Q3 we experienced an 80% decline, again related to the energy and commodity prices. So those are just two examples. Obviously, we have been negatively impacted from this. And I think as we stated, we just really want to be very conservative on the guidance. That's why we're taking guidance down for the rest of the year and having that continue for the business in 2016. If it comes back, it will just be additive to our growing core business.", "Scott Schneeberger", "And Charlie mentioned, worldwide, could you give us a little bit of help on what is domestic and what is outside the U.S.? And in the U.S. geographically, are we -- in the oil patch is where this is mostly occurring? And the commodity is the international? Just a better feel for -- and you gave some splits before on what impacted third quarter, what you think will impact fourth quarter. Just if you could give some splits around that, please, it would be helpful.", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes, I think if you think back, Stericycle has built an environmental solutions business not in the U.S., but in other parts of the Americas as well. So when we think about the business for us, it's the U.S., it's Canada, it's Latin America. And when you look at where we're seeing this impact, we're seeing it -- we're seeing it evenly across. The business is bigger domestically, obviously. So when you look at the split, is about an 80%/20% split, 80% affecting the U.S., 20% affecting international. And that is just because of the scale of the business, Scott.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk. Your line is now open.", "Al Kaschalk", "Sorry, I think that's Al, right? On the expense items that were elevated, I'm not sure if I understood what those were, if there was just lower utilization. Just maybe a little bit more color on helping to explain the $0.03, $0.04 there that I think you, Dan, articulated.", "Charlie Alutto", "Absolutely. We had a couple of fires in plants, both internationally -- and that does require, when you have that, to temporarily redirect waste for a period of time. And that will carry forward into Q4 and that does come at a cost to be able to move those waste flows.", "Also, you have seen large inflation pressures in certain Latin American countries in which there are large unions that cover our workforce down there. And we're required by regulation and within our union contracts due to the inflation to do a large, kind of unexpected payroll increase. Again, obviously, that is going to continue through.", "The other thing that we've learned is as we've upgraded the compliance of all of our domestic incinerators that meet Title V requirements, that does come in operating at a higher cost. And I think Brent could probably touch on a little bit of color to help you better understand why that happens.", "Brent Arnold", "Yes, as we meet these new emissions standards, what we're finding is we're experiencing higher operating costs, particularly associated with the ongoing maintenance of this new, more stringent equipment to reach these levels. Examples would be our higher supply costs; increased maintenance costs; and then, when we have downtime, just the cost of moving it from one waste processing facility to the other is where we're experiencing that higher cost.", "Al Kaschalk", "So does that allow -- are these costs that you are going to absorb and not be able to pass along? Or, say, in 2016, 2017, over time you will be prudent on getting the higher operating costs in your business out to your customers?", "Charlie Alutto", "I think this is something that over time we can pass on to the customers, especially those customers that utilize incineration, although we will have to look contract by contract. And certainly a lot of this increases go when we have the contract come up for renewal. So certainly, it is something that we feel that we'll get, but we think there will be a lag in when we will be able to get some of these costs back.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Erin Wilson. Your line is now open.", "Erin Wilson", "Can you just -- not to belabor the topic, but can you just speak to the visibility on that industrial waste business and how concentrated is that? You mentioned several projects, the vast majority of it concentrated and is it really an inherently lumpy business? Does it ever make sense to break it out similar to what you do in the returns business, given the volatility there?", "Dan Ginnetti", "Yes, I think, Erin, if we think about visibility for it, it came in Q3. And historically in Q3, even in our medical waste service, July and August tend to be slower months for us. We see a bit of a revenue decline even on the healthcare side as people take vacations. And we have an increased cost of a lot of overtime that takes place in July and August.", "So as we were looking at the business, we saw the normal slowdown. Usually in the medical waste business, it bounces back like it did. On the industrial side, it didn't. The project work is very lumpy.", "When you start making these take-ups and you see the volumes significantly lower, that is when you see that you are not getting that industrial waste volume that you would like to see. And I think the fact of where it happened in Q3, we were looking at our normal July and August. We just did not see the bounce-back, especially in the United States in that September time period.", "Charlie Alutto", "Erin, just to add on, I really don't think it does make sense to break that out. We're utilizing the same sales force, the same transportation fleet, same facilities. It is a percentage of the overall business that we service. And it would be very difficult to break that out.", "Erin Wilson", "And then on the recalls business, kind of going forward, I guess it's kind of your standard guidance there for 2016. Is there -- how much of it was automotive in the most recent quarter? And how should we think about that component of the business going forward? Could that offer upside, I guess?", "Charlie Alutto", "No, thanks, Erin. Certainly we continue to see a rebound in the recall business. If you recall, we started the year at about $20 million. And as Brent said in his prepared remarks, we had the highest amount in the quarter in three years of $30 million. We continue to see uneven business, but the auto sector continues to create opportunities.", "And Brent even talked about it in his opening comments. A lot of that is coming around the call center work. That does have some related lower margins. But we feel really good about where we're in that business, certainly for 2015 and for Q4 and for our 2015 results. When you think about the auto recalls -- why we're excited about that? Obviously there is a heightened sensitivity to auto recalls in general. And if you think about Stericycle, we offer a turnkey solution to these manufacturers to help them assist their customers. So what do we do? We help them in notifying and we help to get their response rate up. And that is where they are getting a lot of pressure.", "So we think it further adds to the solutions in the recall space. We don't break out, certainly, where we're getting these recalls from. But auto recall helped us get to that high level of a little over $30 million in the quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Levine. Your line is now open. ", "Scott Levine", "I don't recall if you gave the gross margin bridge that you typically gave. If you did, I apologize. If you didn't, if you could offer that up? I'm just trying to get a better sense of the gross margins implicit in your guidance. If you back out some of the fees, the fires, etc., costs that were kind of nonrecurring in the quarter -- just trying to get a better sense of what the jumping off point is and whether we should continue to expect that underlying 10 to 20 basis points of sequential gross margin going forward? Or maybe a little bit more color around what Shred-It does for the margin outlook there?", "Dan Ginnetti", "Sure, let me first give you the bridge. I did give it before, but certainly we would be happy to do that for you again. The Q2 gross margin was 42.66%. And when you add the 40 basis points of unfavorability that came from the lower-than-expected project worldwide, we did have those higher costs that I gave a lot of color on. And that was 51 basis points. So that is how you get to the 41.77%.", "If you want to look at the guidance going forward, I would urge you to -- for your modeling, let's focus on EBIT. As we work through mapping Shred-It expenses into Stericycle structure, from IFRS to GAAP, you're going to see changes in gross margin and SG&A. So with that, I think it's more important if you just look at it from an EBIT perspective.", "And I think the model going forward has about a 268 basis point impact when we bring in Shred-It right now. So if you look at our EBIT, it was Q3 23.6, about a 268 basis point impact when you include Shred-It into that number. You will see about 55 basis points of improvement. So, certainly, while we expect some of this to continue, you do see some nice expansion going in there as we work towards the plan Charlie talked about. And I think for your model purposes, about a 20.6 EBIT for Q4. And that would put you at about a full year of 22.3.", "Scott Levine", "And as a follow-up, very quickly, I think last quarter you announced in your international business some new markets for clinical services in Latin America. Any noteworthy trends in your international business generally -- outperformers, just outliers and any additional traction within clinical services to be aware of?", "Brent Arnold", "Scott, this is Brent. Absolutely. We continue to see good growth of our sharps business in Latin America, where we have opened up some new facilities there. We talked a little bit more about that last quarter but continue to see real strong progress both in Brazil and Chile. And then from a clinical services, continue to be pleased by adoption rate and what the team is doing both in Spain and the other parts of Europe.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro. Your line is now open.", "Isaac Ro", " I wanted to start, maybe, Dan, with a question on CapEx and free cash flow. If we sort of look at the guidance you have given for 2016, it doesn't look a bit of a step-up here. I'm wondering the extent to which that might be a one-time increase or is it sort of a new run rate that we should think about for the long-term?", "Dan Ginnetti", "A step up in guidance for free cash flow? Are you talking for Q--?", "Isaac Ro", "Well, not in guidance, just on the absolute number year on year. It's a material increase year on year. I'm curious if that is the run rate or is it sort of a one-time thing as it relates to getting Shred-It integrated and all that?", "Dan Ginnetti", "Yes, I think a big chunk of that obviously is going to come from Shred-It. I think what you're looking at is the guidance year-over-year of about a 13% increase which is in line with the growth that we will give you. Remember, we helped you normalize for what the real performance was and is going to be over that tax and foreign exchange.", "Seeing about a 13% increase. I think that is in line. I think it is conservative, as we usually are coming out in 2016. And we will continue to work on things such as our DSO and to prove that out and continue to bring the cash that will help us continue to grow the business.", "Isaac Ro", "And then maybe just a general question on the overall operating environment. Specifically with regards to pricing, just curious what your assumptions are for 2016 versus 2015. Any change there? And maybe help us understand or remind us how the pricing environment in the Shred-It business may differ from the core. Thank you.", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes, nothing overwhelming in the pricing where we feel going into 2016 as compared to 2015. And as we said before, one of the things we like about Shred-It and their service -- it is truly not volume-driven. So it really fits in well with our normal SQ business, where you go to a stop; you check certain bins.", "It's more about bin tips and collections than it is about volume. And if you think about it, that's very similar to some of our SQ offerings, like Steri-Safe; and even some of our communications solutions offerings which are not really volume-based. So Shred-It, as we said on our calls when we first did the acquisition, from a pricing and a service, it logically fits in to the Stericycle offering.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten. Your line is now open. ", "Adam Baumgarten", "I believe, just to clarify, you gave guidance for 2016 including $750 million in revenue from Shred-It. Correct?", "Dan Ginnetti", "Yes, about $750 million.", "Adam Baumgarten", "And what does that represent growth-wise versus 2015 for just that business?", "Dan Ginnetti", "It is roughly about 4% to 5%.", "Adam Baumgarten", "Okay. And that assumes some FX headwinds, as well, I guess, into next year?", "Dan Ginnetti", "Yes, we did factor that in.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to the presenters.", "Charlie Alutto", "Thank you, Dan. In closing, we're excited about our growth engines going forward. I want to thank everyone for taking time and joining today's call. We will see everybody on the road later this year. Have a great evening. Thanks, everybody.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

My name is Skinner, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Stericycle Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.", "I would now like to turn the call over to our host, Sean McMillan, Vice President of Corporate Finance.", "Sean McMillan - Vice President-Corporate Finance", "I will now read the Safe Harbor statement. This conference call may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. For example, general economic and market conditions. Our actual results could differ significantly from the results described in the forward-looking statements.", "Factors that could cause such differences include changes in governmental regulation of the collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of regulated waste or the proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information, increases in transportation and other operating costs, the level of governmental enforcement of regulations governing regulated waste collection and treatment or the proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information, our obligations to service our substantial indebtedness and to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our private placement notes, term loan credit facility and revolving credit facility, our ability to execute our acquisition strategy and to integrate acquired businesses, competition and demand for services in the regulated waste and secure information destruction industries, political, economic and currency risks related to our foreign operations, impairments of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangibles, variability in the demand for services we provide on a project or non-recurring basis, exposure to environmental liabilities, fluctuations in the price we receive for the sale of paper, disruptions in or attacks on our information technology systems, compliance with existing and future legal and regulatory requirements, as well as other factors described in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "As a result, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results or trends. We make no commitment to disclose any subsequent revisions to forward-looking statements.", "I'll now turn it over to Charlie Alutto, CEO.", "Charles A. Alutto - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Sean. We are pleased to report our fourth quarter results. Overall, our business performed very well in the quarter and remains on track despite foreign exchange headwinds and lower hazardous waste volume from our industrial customers.", "In the quarter, we've made good progress on the Shred-it integration and our team members are working together to help realize the many synergies from this acquisition.", "Joining me on today's call will be Dan Ginnetti, CFO; and Brent Arnold, COO. I will now turn it over to Dan.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Charlie. The results for the fourth quarter are as follows: revenues were $888.3 million, up 31.2% from $676.9 million in Q4 2014. And internal growth, excluding returns and recall revenues, was up 5.2%.", "Domestic revenues were $651.1 million, of which $626.8 million was domestic regulated waste and compliance services; and $24.3 million was recalls and returns. Fourth quarter domestic internal growth, excluding returns and recalls, revenues was up 4%, consisting of SQ up 6% and LQ up 2%. As anticipated, growth rates were impacted by lower fuel surcharges and lower hazardous-waste volumes from our industrial customers.", "International revenues were $237.2 million. And internal growth, adjusted for unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $26.9 million, was up 8.1%. This growth rate was also impacted by lower hazardous-waste volume.", "Acquisitions contributed $200 million to growth in the quarter. Gross profit was $380.4 million or 42.8% of revenues. SG&A expense, including amortization, was $203.6 million or 22.9% of revenues. Net interest expense was $24.9 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $78.9 million or $0.80 on an as-reported basis; and $1.11, when adjusted for acquisition-related expenses and other adjustments.", "Now, for the balance sheet. Our covenant debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.45 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of the revolver at the end of the quarter was approximately $686 million. In the quarter, we repurchased 240,468 shares of common stock on the open market in an amount of $28.646 million. At the end of the quarter, we have authorization to purchase 3.7 million shares.", "Our CapEx was $42.2 million, which included accelerated spending to support 2016 immigration associated with Shred-it. Our DSO was 64 days. Year-to-date, as reported, cash from operations was $390 million. When adjusted for recall reimbursement and other items, cash from operations was $501 million.", "I will now turn it over to Brent.", "Brent Arnold - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Dan. We're widely continuing to use our strong free cash flow to drive our growth through acquisitions. In the quarter, we closed 10 acquisitions, six domestic and four international, including Shred-it. The international acquisitions were one in Canada, one in the Netherlands, one in Mexico and one in Spain. Revenues from the 10 acquisitions were $176.4 million in the quarter and annualized are approximately $728 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust, with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business.", "In the fourth quarter, we continue to see strong growth in our pharmaceutical waste compliance program. Both our SQ and LQ adoption rates continue to increase, as customers look for a compliance solution for this waste stream. This program not only helps our customers manage their pharmaceutical waste, but it often paves the way for Stericycle to manage all of their hazardous waste.", "Our Shred-it integration efforts remain a priority across the organization. The Cintas Shred-it synergies are on track, focusing on routing efficiencies and on-site to offsite conversion. The Stericycle Shred-it integration is gaining momentum and the team has kicked off a number of exciting cross-selling pilots. As a reminder, less than 20% of our existing Stericycle customers use Shred-it for secure information destruction. This represents a tremendous growth opportunity for Stericycle.", "To assist with the integration, we're working with a consulting firm to help us optimize our long-term organizational structure. The goal is to maximize our growth opportunities and to better serve our customers. We're anticipating implementation to start later this year.", "Looking ahead, we continue to see expanding growth opportunities as Stericycle provides multiple services to help our customers improve their operations and achieve their goals. As we execute on this strategy, we can more than triple our customer revenues.", "In closing, I want to thank each member of our worldwide team for their strong performance and continued commitment to our customers, our shareholders and to our core values.", "I will now turn it over to Charlie.", "Charles A. Alutto - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Brent. I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2016. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration, acquisition-related and other adjusted items. As a reminder, our 2016 EPS guidance is adjusted for amortization expense.", "For 2016, we believe analysts' EPS estimates will be in the range of $5.26 to $5.33, reflecting the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and the share count of approximately 92 million, which we're comfortable with. We believe analysts' revenue estimates for 2016 will be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.67 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates.", "We anticipate 2016 internal growth rates to be: SQ 7% to 9%; LQ 4% to 7%; international 6% to 9%; and recall and return revenues between $95 million to $120 million. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow in 2016 between $460 million to $480 million. 2016 CapEx is anticipated to be between $125 million to $135 million. We expect the 2016 full year as-reported tax rate to be in the range of 36% to 36.5%.", "In closing, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter results and remain excited about our multiple growth opportunities for 2016 and beyond.", "Thank you for your time today. We'll now answer any questions. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question as necessary. Skinner, you can now open the question queue.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Absolutely. Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels from William Blair. Your line is now open.", "Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Yeah. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Dan, maybe I'll start with one for you. Just trying to get a better feel for the cadence of EPS progression through the year, given paper prices, the Shred-it integration and synergies in industrial waste work. I guess I'm trying to figure out, might this be more of a backend loaded year, or should we think of it being relatively consistent to years past?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. I think we've done a lot looking at that. And if you were to look at where we finished the year at $1.11, when you factor in also the amortization that's going to be excluded (10:31) out next year that jump-off point really equates to $1.24. We have $0.03 of non-recurring EPS that won't repeat itself; and that really brings the jump-off point to about $1.21. And then we have about $0.03 of normal seasonality we would expect in Q1 and additional $0.01 of headwind to tax. So I think you're best to jump off the year at about $1.17 and then ramp up throughout the course of the year, probably evenly dispersing it from there on.", "Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. That's very helpful. And then the recent weakness in recycled paper pricing, has that impacted your thoughts on how you're guiding for that going forward or are you still assuming an uptick in the back half of the year, so using more of a blended estimate?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So if you remember, much like foreign exchange, we only give guidance based off the current rates; and the current rates that we had at the time was $126 per ton. That equated to about an $0.08 impact in 2016. But from some work in the operational efficiencies and some favorability in depreciation, we were able to exactly offset that. So there's been no guidance change for that going forward as from an EPS perspective. And so, throughout the course of the year, we really don't anticipate any change; and that's just assumes at $126.", "Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. So in effect, your fundamental earnings performance is a little bit higher, but that's being offset just by the paper pricing and some FX headwind. Is that the good way to think about it?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. So why don't I just take you through the EPS bridge for the $5.26 to the $5.33 that we gave you. So you remember, the jump-off point was $5.28 to $5.35. We saw $0.08 of headwinds from the paper directly offset by depreciation. The foreign exchange, the $48 million due to the current rate is about a $0.05 to $0.06 headwind, offset by $0.02 to $0.03 of interest, favorability and about $0.01 on the acquisition. So really if you look at the impact of the paper and the foreign exchange, we really only changed the guidance about $0.02.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets.", "Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hi, guys. Good afternoon.", "Charles A. Alutto - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Gary.", "Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "The first question, so can you give us update on the second derivative energy-exposed revenue that you talked about last quarter and maybe more broadly that base of manufacturing, industrial projects-based work. Any change in the other part, from the $70 million that you focused on last quarter?", "Charles A. Alutto - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. No, if we think about \u2013 when we talked about last quarter and the reality of Q4, it was right on what we expected. We thought the full quarter impact was going to be about $18 million. That's roughly 80% domestic, 20% international. That came in as expected and that obviously has an impact on growth rate. The other part of the business I think you're talking to is that other part of the project in industrial waste work that's not affected by commodity; and that performed as expected in the quarter. We didn't see any pullback in that part of the business.", "I think Brent talked about it in his comments, RX waste specifically. That is hazardous waste, a good portion of that hazardous waste upon disposal. The team had a really good quarter in Q4. And again, to remind everybody, our focus in hazardous waste is on healthcare hazardous waste, it's on retail hazardous waste and SQ hazardous waste. And those parts of the business are doing well.", "Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay, great. And then just taking a step back from what's been going on with Shred-it and haz-waste, I guess your international business has had margins well below the U.S. for, I guess, ever since you got into it. I know there's structurally probably some reason you'll never have the scale. But what are you doing? What's on the game plan, thinking about the next couple of years to try to close that gap or improve the international profitability? And is that something that you think can happen or are we much more focused on Shred-it, getting haz-waste fixed and growing in terms of the near-term opportunity? Thank you.", "Brent Arnold - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hey, Gary. It's Brent. The answer would be all of the above. We want to improve it across the globe. But I think it's good to take a step back and really just remember that usually when we enter a new country is with LQ. And we usually will go there to establish a base. Over time, we look to improve the mix via tuck-in acquisitions and new services. A good example of that would be Dosimetry.", "So that's usually the way we'll try to work it. We'll also try to continue to sell things like clinical services to continue to improve those margins. So the team is very focused on that. We're making some good progress in other areas. But I think you also have to take into account that these markets have been difficult markets over the last several years. And the team's I think done a really good job to make sure that we continue to stay focused on improving our margins.", "Operator", "And our next questioner is David Manthey from Robert W. Baird.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hi, guys. First of all in the returns and recall business, I think you indicated that that was $24.3 million. On the press release, the adjustment you make is $20.4 million, I believe. Am I missing something there?", "Charles A. Alutto - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I think there might be the acquisition effect on that, David, that's why you see that being lower. The reported is the $24.3 million, that's correct; and the difference is the acquisition that happened. I believe it was actually fourth quarter of last year.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "I see. Okay. And then the $0.08 of paper impact offset by depreciation. Dan, could you just tell me what that means? I'm not sure exactly what the mechanisms you're referring to there.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. So we saw a $14 change in paper prices. And actually if you looked at the quarter, about $1.33 is what the average was, but we're looking at $126 going forward. Our guidance was at $140. That equates to about an $0.08 impact.", "But as part of our normal process of purchase accounting and booking and opening balance sheet, after the closing we did a fair market study of Shred-it's fixed assets and then actually reduced the revenue expectation \u2013 or I'm sorry, the depreciation expectation we had for the year, and it happen to directly offset the decline in paper prices. So right now, there's no EPS impact to the Shred-it business assuming paper prices continue at $126 per ton.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "I see. So it's kind of a one-time thing, but it canceled it out for the current year. Then the last question I have for you, Dan, in terms of the other income expense line, you've been reporting an other expense of about $800,000 for the past two years or three years on average, and this quarter was other income of $4.5 million. What was that?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. We had the opportunity to renegotiate a seller note; and in doing that we're also able to negotiate it into an alternative currency, and that generated about $0.03 along with some favorability in the interest. So that combined generated about $0.03. The interest will repeat, but the note was obviously a one-time effect that will not repeat going forward.", "Operator", "And our next questioner is Al Kaschalk from Wedbush Securities.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Good afternoon, guys. I want to focus on the commentary about the good progress on the synergies related to Cintas. Can you give us a little more color on that?", "Brent Arnold - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Absolutely. Al, this is Brent. I've had an opportunity to visit a lot of Shred-It locations over the last several months and I'm really pleased so far with the integration; and, overall, everything is on track. To-date, we've completed over 50% of our reroutes, which is terrific. But the team continues to improve that process and refine that as we go forward, as well as the on-site to offsite conversions are also on track. So, overall, we're very pleased with the efforts. The team members are I think fitting in great with our company and we're really excited about where this is headed.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Can you put a little more quantification around the progress on \u2013 I think you said the first 12 months you were focused on capturing the Cintas synergies; and the commentary was you've also started to make some progress on the Stericycle synergies. So I'm just trying to gather how much of that \u2013 I don't know if it was $52 million or $57 million \u2013 you've captured this quarter and how we're on track for the next nine months?", "Brent Arnold - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. When we last spoke, I think it was about 30% of the way with regard to the Cintas Shred-It synergies. And, to-date, we're just shy of 50% of the way with regard to those synergies. So the team continues to make great progress.", "Charles A. Alutto - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And I think on the Stericycle Shred-it synergies integration, we told you that that was going to be more at the back end of 2016, Al, and moving forward into 2017.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Thanks. Good afternoon. Guys, just circling back on the RMS question. It looks like you were light on the year. I'm just curious \u2013 but you maintained the 2016 outlook. Did something not come through in the fourth quarter? And how is the momentum entering the year to maintain the guidance? Thanks.", "Charles A. Alutto - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. As you know, Scott, that's a lumpy business for us. It's really uneven. It's hard to predict. So it's hard to say coming into the first part of the year if we're going to take guidance down. If you look back, the last three quarters for recall and returns, or our RMS part of our business, has been really well. The team has done solid. We think that will continue into next year. So there was no reason at this point to change the guidance.", "I mean, it all comes down to blockbuster events. If we can get larger recall events in 2016, we'll be on the higher end of the range; and if we don't see those come in, we're confident on the low end of the range. So, again, the range is around $95 million to $120 million, and that's unchanged. And that obviously is within \u2013 the year finished at $102.8 million. So we were in the range, and we feel confident about the 2016 guidance there.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And I know automotive was helpful this past year. Is that going to be a driving force next year or will \u2013 there may be other sources in pharma, or you just don't have that visibility yet?", "Charles A. Alutto - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No, it's a good call-out, Scott. I mean there certainly \u2013 we did that acquisition last year to get an entry into the auto recall space. There's obviously a lot of heightened sensitivity to auto recalls. We can offer a turnkey solution to manufacturers. That helps them assist their customers with both notifications and increasing their response rate. So still early stages with respect to our automotive recall capabilities. We're doing a great job. The team continues to win some deals in that space and we feel really good about that acquisition and about the outlook for 2016.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "All right. Thanks, Charlie. And could you guys just hit on real quick, your ability to surcharge on used paper price, how much has that been rolled out and how is that influencing the guidance update? Thanks so much.", "Charles A. Alutto - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. We already have that factored into the guidance update. Our plan though is over time is to mitigate the sorted office paper revenue fluctuations through contracts terms and conditions. This is going to take time. This will be addressed on a customer-by-customer basis. Certainly, in Shred-It the average contract is between two years and four years. So this will take us several years to get through all the customers. But we think we'll make progress as we get further into the integration.", "Operator", "And our next questioner comes from Scott Levine at Imperial Capital.", "Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "Hey. Good afternoon, guys.", "Charles A. Alutto - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Scott.", "Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "Hey. I don't know if you gave the gross margin bridge, Dan, but I was hoping you might be able to go over that. The margins rebounded nicely on the gross line. And then also quantify the impact of fuel and how much of a positive that was in the quarter?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Let me take you through the gross margin. And I want to remind you that as we spoke last time and we were going to integrate Shred-It into the business, that we fully expected that they were going to see some puts and takes, you'd see favorability on the gross margin line, and then you'd also see a little bit higher of an SG&A as a result; and that there was going to be a lot of moving parts on that. So I think it's probably more appropriate if I take you through the EBIT bridge. And that'll take a little bit of the noise out, but certainly we did see favorability on the gross margin line. That was nice.", "But from an EBIT perspective, Q3 EBIT was 22.6%. Shred-it impacted the EBIT by about 245 basis points, which is actually better than what we had anticipated. And then improvements in the overall business really offset the lower revenues, slightly lower revenues that we saw and some of the challenging economic conditions in Latin America. So those offset each other and I would say the better performance. We're very pleased with the results of the EBIT and the gross margin, for that matter.", "Brent Arnold - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "And then, Scott, with regard to the impact of fuel with regard to our profitability, as you recall, we're on the fuel surcharge for a great portion of our business. So what we typically will see is as fuel comes down, so will the surcharges for that; and that's an offsetting effect with regard to the lower cost. So really it's a net push with regards to the benefit of the business.", "Charles A. Alutto - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Wash it down at the EBIT line.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And, Scott, what you'll see on the gross margin and the SG&A line is that those puts and takes have ironed out a little bit. And those are pretty good jump-off points for building the bridge and going forward on that.", "Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "Got it. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, given the comments you made about the reduction in D&A associated with the change in accounting, can you give us a sense of what we should be assuming in our models on a go-forward basis as the add back to arrive at cash EPS on a quarterly basis in 2016?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. I think for depreciation about $44 million and for amortization about $36 million.", "Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital LLC", "Got you. Thank you.", "Charles A. Alutto - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Scott.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Barbara Noverini.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Research", "Hey. Good afternoon, everybody.", "Charles A. Alutto - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Barb.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Research", "So you've guided organic revenue growth rates in 2016 that are pretty similar to business as usual. So what gives you the confidence that the weakness in the industrial hazardous waste volumes won't accelerate through the year? How good is your visibility into those project pipelines?", "Charles A. Alutto - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Well, I think when we give \u2013 it's important that when we give guidance, it's an annual guidance for our growth rate. So if you think about where we are today with growth rates last quarter of 62%, had we normalized that for fuel surcharges and a reduction in hazardous waste volume, we would have been at SQ at about 8%, LQ at about 7%.", "When we look forward to next year, we know that we'll have a tough comparable in Q1 and Q2 and part of Q3, but then we won't have that in the backend of the year. So as far as confidence, we think obviously we'll be at the lower end of the range for growth rates in the first half of the year, and then we'll have improvement in the latter part of the year. But, overall, when you look at the annual growth rates, we think we'll be between that SQ of 7% to 9% and the LQ of 4% to 7%.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Research", "Got it. Thanks. And then can you remind us what the business mix is in hazardous waste? What percentage of sales is associated with industrial versus retail versus healthcare hazardous waste?", "Charles A. Alutto - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. When you think about our business, hazardous waste worldwide, it's roughly $650 million. And we called out that we have project work in large industrial waste customers of anywhere between $125 million to $200 million. So that's that portion of the business. We don't really break out the other portion of the business, but retail hazardous waste certainly is a major contributor as is our healthcare hazardous waste and our SQ business as well.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Research", "All right. Thanks very much.", "Charles A. Alutto - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Barb.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs.", "Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks, guys. It's actually Joel in for Isaac.", "Charles A. Alutto - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Joel.", "Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "So how should we be thinking about the incremental opportunities for M&A in the paper shredding business? Is it too soon to be thinking about how you guys are going to be? Are you guys doing any major deals here? And then what types of assets in terms of size or capability or geographic footprint would you be looking for?", "Charles A. Alutto - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I think one thing that we did this quarter is, besides the Shred-it acquisition, we made four acquisitions of other secure information destruction companies. So we certainly \u2013 it's part of our game plan. Shred-it obviously had a pipeline, and we were able to complete those deals in Q4.", "From a geography line, certainly any country where we currently have operations, those have the best returns; and that's where the focus will be. And then we'll also look at countries that Stericycle is currently in on the waste side of the business and see if there are opportunities to enter into those secure information destruction markets as well.", "Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great. Thanks. And then I think it's about six months since you guys went live with the Title V compliant incinerators. Any change to the plans to push those incremental operating costs to your customer base as the contracts roll over? And if so, to what extent do you think this would be somewhat of a competitive disadvantage as these contracts expire?", "Brent Arnold - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, with regard to competitive disadvantage, I don't really see that happening because our incineration and the fact that we're vertically integrated there really helps us provide the best possible value for our customers to manage their pharmaceutical waste. So with regard to overall cost, as we've talked about before, as those contracts renew, we're able to accelerate those. And if there are regulatory changes, we're also able to oftentimes go back and renegotiate those with our customers.", "Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Sean Dodge from Jefferies.", "Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC", "Afternoon, thanks. Charlie, on the core hazardous waste business, if we strip away the $125 million to $200 million of project-based and industrial exposure there that you had mentioned, can you give us an idea of how organic growth rates in that core part of the hazardous waste business have trended over the last few quarters?", "Charles A. Alutto - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. And, Sean, we didn't strip out the whole $125 million to $200 million. We roughly thought, and I think we were fairly accurate, that about 50% of that \u2013 between the $125 million and the $200 million, so about $80 million of that was project or industrial waste-related. I will tell you, there are parts of those businesses, like retail haz-waste, that have growth rates that are actually higher than our current growth rates or our organic growth rates. So it varies by business line. But the business itself, if you take out the project and the industrial waste parts of the business, it's growing at or above our company average.", "Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Thank you. And then Rich had mentioned in the prepared remarks that acquisitions had contributed about $176.4 million of revenue to the quarter. How much of that was Shred-it?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "There was only about $1.6 million outside of Shred-it. So the acquisitions that we did outside of that were more towards the end of the month.", "Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC", "Got it. All right. Thank you very much.", "Charles A. Alutto - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Sean.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Larry Keusch from Raymond James.", "Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hi. Good afternoon. Wondering if you \u2013 I mean, I know it's been a relatively brief period that you've had the Shred-it business in-house, but would you mind talking about anything perhaps surprising versus your expectations going in?", "Brent Arnold - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Overall, I would tell you that we haven't had any major surprises. I think the common themes that we've seen is, one, the service is very complementary to our existing compliance services. So that works well for us. Two, I continue to be very impressed with the people and how similar their culture is to ours. So, so far, it's been great to work with them. Where I continue to get most excited is the cross-sell opportunities. We've got multiple opportunities everywhere you look to cross-sell their services into our customers. I was just at the National Sales Meeting last week and our LQ team, who's had a great deal of success selling additional services into hospitals like our SMS or our RX waste or hazardous waste, all of them now are trained and ready to go with regards to selling that service into hospitals. And, again, I'm very confident we'll be successful there.", "We also have another several pilots going on with regard to their sales executives and selling into our existing Stericycle medical waste customers. And what they typically do is they go in and give them a compliance review, looking at how they manage all their secure information. Oftentimes when they do that audit, we can find compliance breaches. And it's a great way for them to switch to an outsourced service. And, therefore, we're selling multiple services. So, overall, I would tell you that we continue to be very encouraged, and the things that we thought going into this are turning out true. And, again, we think this will be a great long-term acquisition for us.", "Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay, terrific. And then just one other one, I just want to make sure I've got my math right. I'm pretty sure on the third quarter call you indicated in the 2016 guidance that you were assuming $760 million in revenues for Shred-It. So, A, I wanted to make sure that was accurate; and, B, is that still the case as you think about 2016?", "Charles A. Alutto - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. That was accurate for the guidance that we gave last time. Obviously we discussed the paper impact, which will be about $12 million. They also have about 25% of their business which is international. So they have (33:13) about an $8 million foreign exchange impact. And then \u2013 also on the lower fuel prices, they lose (33:18) a little there. I think you're better to look at about $738 million now next year. But the great thing is with some of that benefit, we saw an appreciation. From an EBITDA view that we gave you last time, at about $20.7 million, the new guidance is about $21.1 million. So really only about $1 million difference on the EBITDA line.", "Operator", "The last question comes from Michael Hoffman from Stifel.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hey. Thank you guys for taking my question. If I can follow up on that last one, so the other number you gave in the third quarter was \u2013 you actually focused on EBIT at 16.7% margins for EBIT in document destruction. Wanted to verify that was still the right number. And then I just want to make sure I caught the paper number you're saying is in the $740 million now or $738 million, is that still about $120 million of papers in that number?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "The first question on the EBIT line, we're looking at about a 16.2%. So that came down very modestly from the 16.7% largely due to the decline in paper. And right now, we said the change in the paper revenue was about $12 million based off the latest known rate, which is $126 per ton.", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then my follow-up on the hazardous waste business, the $650 million is the as reported 2015. So what was the exit rate of revenues and what percentage of that is in industrial overall and what percentage of that is project?", "Charles A. Alutto - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I don't have a breakout for that, Michael, on what is industrial. What was your second part of that, industrial and?", "Michael Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "So you said $650 million, but I'm assuming that's reported 2015. But you're exiting at a slower rate because it's down in the second half versus up in the first half, right? So am I entering the year really at a run rate that's more like $620 million, and then I've got $150 million as industrial, so I'm really talking $470 million as retail and medical waste and pharmacy? That's the way to think about it?", "Charles A. Alutto - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And you got some background noise. Sorry about that, Michael. When you're ending the year \u2013 first of all, it's approximately $650 million. And if you take the reduction in Q3, which was about $8 million, and the reduction in this quarter which was about $18 million, that's really what you take off entering into 2016; and then we'll see two more quarters of about $18 million each. So another $36 million. But if you want to do it annually, I would take 18 times 4. That's probably another way you can look at it for 2016.", "Operator", "And at this time, we have no more questions in queue.", "Charles A. Alutto - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, everybody, again for participating on our call. Depending on analyst models, revenues adjusted EBIT and EBITDA will all show growth in excess of 20%. It's going to be an exciting 2016. Have a great evening. We'll see everybody on the road in the next couple of months. Thanks for joining, everybody. Take care.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's call. You may now disconnect.

My name is Steve and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Stericycle First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.", "VP of Corporate Finance, Sean McMillan, you may begin your conference.", "Sean McMillan", "Welcome to Stericycle's first quarter 2016 conference call. I will now read the Safe Harbor statement. This conference call may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, for example, general economic and market conditions. Our actual results could differ significantly from the results described in forward-looking statements.", "Factors that could cause such differences include changes in governmental regulations of the collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of regulated waste or the proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information; increases in transportation and other operating costs; the level of governmental enforcement of regulations governing regulated waste collection and treatment or the proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information; our obligations to service our substantial indebtedness and to comply with the covenants and the restrictions contained in our private placement notes, term loan credit facility and revolving credit facility; our ability to execute our acquisition strategy and to integrate acquired businesses; competition and demand for services in the regulated waste and secure information destruction industries; political, economic and currency risks related to our foreign operations; impairments of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangibles; variability in the demand for services we provide on a project or non-recurring basis; exposure to environmental liabilities, fluctuations in the price we receive for the sale of paper, disruptions in or attacks on our information technology systems; compliance with existing and future legal and regulatory requirements as well as other factors described in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "As a result, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results or trends. We make no commitment to disclose any subsequent revisions to forward-looking statements.", "I will now turn it over to Charlie Alutto, CEO.", "Charles Alutto", "Thank you for joining us on today's call. In the first quarter, we experienced strong revenue growth, strong cash flow and solid sequential growth for the Shred-It acquisition. Results in the quarter were unfavorably impacted by the timing of the Shred-It synergies and lower industrial hazardous waste revenues. Despite the challenges in the quarter, we remain confident about our business.", "Joining me on today's call will be Dan Ginnetti, CFO; and Brent Arnold, COO. I will now turn it over to Dan.", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Thank you, Charlie. The results for the first quarter are as follows: revenues were $874.2 million, up 31.8% from $663.3 million in Q1 2015. And internal growth, excluding returns and recalls revenues, was up 5.6%.", "Domestic revenues were $649.7 million, of which $624.9 million was domestic regulated waste and compliance services; and $24.8 million was recalls and returns. First quarter domestic internal growth, excluding recalls and returns revenues was up 5%, consisting of SQ up 6% and LQ up 4%. As anticipated, growth rates were impacted by lower fuel surcharges and lower hazardous waste volumes from our industrial customers.", "International revenues were $224.5 million. And internal growth, adjusted for unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $23.8 million was up 7%. This growth rate was also impacted by lower hazardous waste volume.", "Acquisitions contributed $194.5 million to growth in the quarter. Gross profit was $369.2 million or 42.2% of revenues. SG&A expense, including amortization, was $207.3 million or 23.7% of revenues. Net interest expense was $24 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $66.7 million or $0.78 per share on an as reported basis and $1.11 when adjusted for acquisition-related expenses and other adjustments.", "Our covenant, debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.41 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of the revolver at the end of the quarter was approximately $584 million. In the quarter, we repurchased 327,952 shares of common stock on the open market in an amount of $37.693 million. At the end of the quarter, we have authorization to purchase 3.4 million shares.", "Our CapEx was $34.2 million, or 3.9% of revenues. Our DSO was 63 days. Year-to-date, cash from operations was $156.9 million. When adjusted for recall reimbursement and other items, cash from operations was $163.6 million.", "I will now turn it over to Brent.", "Brent Arnold", "Thanks, Dan. Worldwide, we continue to use our strong free cash flow to drive our growth through acquisitions. In the quarter, we closed seven acquisitions, five domestic and two international. The international acquisitions were one in Spain and one in Romania. Revenues from the seven acquisitions were approximately $1 million in the quarter and annualized are approximately $12.4 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business.", "In the quarter, the Shred-It sales team delivered strong new sales growth. As a reminder, Shred-It has over 350 sales professionals across North America focused on converting customers that either do not shred or shred themselves. This unvented market represents a $2.5 billion growth opportunity for Stericycle.", "We also are encouraged by the progress the combined sales teams are having in selling Shred-It SOLUTIONS. This quarter, the team closed eight health systems and multiple national accounts. Today, less than 20% of our current Stericycle healthcare customers use Shred-It as a secure information destruction provider, representing a nice growth opportunity for Stericycle.", "Our Shred-It integration efforts remain a priority across the organization. We are confident in our ability to achieve the full $73 million in Cintas-Shred-It synergies and our team has either completed or made solid progress on many of the integration projects.", "However, we have reassessed the original timeline associated with the reroutes and onsite-to-offsite conversions. While several regions have successfully made this conversion, the time to convert each region is taking longer than previously anticipated. In order to ensure high service levels and support ongoing new customer growth, we have decided to extend the rollout schedule going forward.", "The new timeline enables the reroute teams to provide the necessary support and assistance without negatively impacting our customers. Based on these changes, approximately $20 million of the anticipated reroute and onsite-to-offsite synergies will be extended into 2017 with a full impact in 2018.", "In our retail and healthcare hazardous waste compliance program, we continue to experience strong growth. The growth is fueled by increased enforcement of existing regulations and by Stericycle's strong customer relationships in both retail and the healthcare industry.", "Looking ahead, we continue to see expanding growth opportunities as Stericycle provides multiple services to help our customers improve their operations and achieve their goals. As we execute on this strategy, we can more than triple our customers' revenues.", "We would like to congratulate Stericycle's Parkersburg, West Virginia facility for receiving Congressional recognition as a Star Status site in OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program. This is the first medical waste facility to earn the VPP award, and it demonstrates the team's dedication to our corporate values.", "In closing, I want to thank each member of our worldwide team for their continued commitment to our customers, our shareholders, and our core values.", "I will now turn it over to Charlie.", "Charles Alutto", "Thanks, Brent. I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2016. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements, and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration and acquisition-related expenses, and other adjusted items. As a reminder, our 2016 EPS guidance is adjusted for amortization expense.", "For 2016, we believe analysts' EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.90 to $5.05, reflecting the unfavorable impact of the timing of the Shred-It synergies, softer industrial hazardous waste volume, and higher costs associated with our international operations. We believe analysts' revenue estimates for 2016 will be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.66 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and the impact of foreign exchange rates. We anticipate 2016 internal growth rates to be SQ, 7% to 9%; LQ, 4% to 7%; international, 6% to 9%; and recall and returns revenues between $95 million and $115 million.", "We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow in 2016 between $435 million and $455 million. 2016 CapEx is anticipated to be between $125 million to $135 million. We expect the 2016 full year as reported tax rate to be approximately 35.5%.", "In closing, although disappointed with our results in Q1, we are confident about the long-term fundamentals in our business and remain excited about the growth opportunities in 2016 and beyond.", "Thank you for your time today. We'll now answer any questions. Steve, you can open the queue.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open.", "Ryan Daniels", "Yeah. Good evening, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Dan, maybe one for you. Looks like about a 5% cut to EPS, and I'm hoping you could bridge that for us from the prior guidance and break down kind of the three impacts you outlined and how each of those is impacting the bottom line.", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Yeah, Ryan. I'd be happy to do that. So the prior guidance was $5.26 to $5.33. We had a $0.05 miss in the quarter, so that's obviously going to roll into the next guidance. There was some strength in paper prices and slightly lower interest rates, and we had some acquisition contribution and that was offset by some higher depreciation expense. That nets to about $0.01 to $0.02 of favorable expense \u2013 favorable EPS.", "The delay, as Brent mentioned in his dialogue, in recognition of Shred-It synergies, is anywhere between $0.07 to $0.12 unfavorable. International cost pressures in Latin America and the UK is between $0.07 to $0.10 unfavorable. And we had some softness in the industrial markets, and a mix of customers in ESAW business, that will be anywhere from $0.10 to $0.11 on the year unfavorable. So the new guidance from there will bridge you to $4.90 to $5.05. And I think when you're looking at Q2, I think it's best to pick a range between $1.16 and $1.20 and I think you'd be in a good position for the quarter.", "Ryan Daniels", "Okay. And then as my follow-up, can you go into a little bit more detail on the elongation of the Shred-It synergies? Do you think that's just going through two separate mergers, is kind of distracting that workforce or is it as you pushed some of the changes to route density improvements and moving to off-site has impacted customer churn or anything of that nature, such that you're trying to slow down and kind of elongate that? Just any color there would be helpful.", "Brent Arnold", "Hey, Ryan. This is Brent. Absolutely. This is not about if we can get the on-site to off-site and reroute synergies, but rather when we will get these. All of us here want to get these synergies as soon as possible. We just need to make sure we do it in a timeframe that does not negatively impact our customers. It probably makes sense to give a little bit of description of what we're talking about and what really goes into an on-site to off-site conversion.", "First, with all of the conversions of this type, you have to have clean data. You need to know things like service location, number of consoles, hours of operation, key contact information.", "Let me remind you that the team recently went through a merger of operating systems when Cintas joined Shred-It. And while that went well, there definitely is some items that still need to be cleaned up as part of that data clean-up. Then you notify the customers. So, you're notifying all the customers that are currently on-site, and you're letting them know that we're going to be switching their service from on-site shredding with a truck that has a shredder on it to taking that back to our facility and shredding back at our facility. So, you have to make sure you have all the right supplies, right, because we're switching trucks. So, you have to have that right number of box trucks, lift gates, consoles to transport the materials. So, all of those things need to be in place.", "Ultimately though, and this is really where we're noticing the biggest challenge is when you make the change, our team members now are going to new sites. So, imagine, Ryan, if a CSR is coming to your facility. The number of consoles you have across William Blair, and they've not serviced it before, you now are \u2013 while we have a description and location on the handheld, you still need to find those. And you need to find the best way to kind of wrap through your office to find all those consoles. So, there's a learning curve that our CSRs or drivers need to go through when we make these changes.", "Believe it or not, the first probably several weeks after re-route were actually less efficient than we were before the re-route. But as they go through that learning curve and that settles down, we start to get efficiency, and we ultimately will do a final kind of polishing re-route to really put as many stops on those routes as possible.", "So, again, our focus here is about how do we do this without impacting the customer, recognizing the synergies, and ultimately, doing it in a way that allows us to continue to close new business. The reason we're confident that we're going to get that $73 million, we've done this many times before. Our pilot market in Toronto, in Cleveland, in Charlotte, in Boston, in Detroit. There's a number of markets where we have successfully done this, but what we've decided to do is, you know what, this needs to be more of a 16-week process than an 8-week process and the timeline was just too aggressive. So in assessing that, we decided to extend it out ultimately because we do not want to disrupt service with our customers.", "Ryan Daniels", "Okay. Very helpful color. I'll hop back in the queue.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.", "Al Kaschalk", "Good afternoon, everybody.", "Brent Arnold", "Hey, Al.", "Al Kaschalk", "I appreciate the bridge on the EPS, but I guess I want to look at \u2013 take maybe a different angle at the mix of revenue that you have and maybe the profitability of that. And maybe there's some color you can provide us in terms of the percentage of industrial revenue that's international versus domestic and if there's any margin impact there.", "It appears to me just, again, on the surface that the business you've added isn't as profitable as you think it was or thought it was, or really the piece that's coming off on the industrial side is really pretty significant. So is there any color you can provide on that? And then second, I guess the follow-up to that would be, was there are further lag down in the first quarter on the industrial piece, specifically from when you exited 2015?", "Charles Alutto", "Yeah. This is Charlie. I'll take that. I think when you think about how this situation with Stericycle, roughly 80% of it is domestic, 20% is international. But if we dig down to the Q1 impact on what we call our environmental solutions business, hazardous waste volumes \u2013 that is excluding retail haz waste and healthcare haz waste. We're anticipating \u2013 we were anticipating that to grow at a seasonally \u2013 at seasonally adjusted rate of about 3%. It actually came in at a negative 4% for the quarter, so roughly speaking about $5.5 million soft on our industrial or our hazardous waste volumes.", "In addition, the mix of the waste that we did actually pick up in our projects resulted in a higher anticipated disposal expense of roughly about $1.5 million, and that has to do with some of the larger projects we did were direct disposal, and we have direct disposal as opposed to going through our facilities. We do incur a higher disposal expense for those accounts, and that's what Dan was referring to when he was talking about mix in the environmental solutions business or our hazardous waste business.", "So certainly we did see a lower hazardous waste volume. The good news, I think, though, and Brent talked about it in his opening, is where we are focused. That's the healthcare hazardous waste. That's the retail hazardous waste. That's the SQ hazardous waste. We had really strong growth there, but unfortunately we have a mix issue when it comes to the facilities that we've acquired to support this growth, and that is \u2013 has a very high fixed cost to it, and that's where you see it hurting us, not only on the revenue line but also on the profit line.", "Al Kaschalk", "Does that continue for \u2013 I know your annual guidance incorporates how that water falls off, but do we have another quarter? Do we have two quarters to go in terms of sort of normalizing it from an operations standpoint?", "Charles Alutto", "Yeah. We look at it as a conservative thing that that softness in hazardous waste will continue. We don't know. Again, the project work is unpredictable, but from a guidance perspective, for the year, it was around $0.10 or $0.11 spread now over the first quarter and then continuing into the rest of the quarter. So about $0.02 or $0.03 a quarter.", "Al Kaschalk", "Good luck, guys. Thank you.", "Charles Alutto", "Thanks, Al.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sean Dodge with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Sean Dodge", "Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks. So you guys talked about the extended timeline on the synergies related to the Cintas acquisition. Is there any \u2013 do you have any updated thoughts on the $20 million to $30 million of incremental synergies Stericycle thinks they can get? I think you initially said those would be an opportunity beginning in 2017. Is that \u2013 are those still on track?", "Brent Arnold", "Yes. Sean, you're thinking about that exactly right. We've got groups working on those now. We really feel like we'll start to see impacts with those in the back half of 2016 and throughout 2017, with the full-year impact in 2018.", "Sean Dodge", "Okay. And then is there any update you can give on the business optimization exercise or process you guys have undertaken?", "Brent Arnold", "Yeah. So as we talked about on the last call, we're working with an outside consultant. Really the focus has been how do we set up our business, coming out with the Shred-It acquisition and off the heels of the PSC acquisition. How do we set up our business for growth long term? We're looking across all of our businesses. In North America, our goal was to have this completed by mid-2016, which we're on track, and we're excited to be able to share more of that with you at the Q2 call.", "Sean Dodge", "Were there any costs associated with that in the first quarter that wouldn't necessarily be recurring but you haven't backed out?", "Daniel Ginnetti", "No. The costs that we have incurred on that, they're early on. Some of these costs are being captured in our integration expense because it really is about bringing these acquired organizations together with ours.", "Sean Dodge", "Understood. Thanks again.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Gary Bisbee", "Hey, guys. Good afternoon.", "Charles Alutto", "Hey, Gary.", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Hey, Gary.", "Gary Bisbee", "Hi. I guess I wanted to ask about the international business. Just looking at the 10-K, and in the Ks and Qs obviously you give more detail and that the margins there relative to the U.S business are like less than a third the amount. I know that got hurt last year by haz, like the U.S. did, but I guess the question is this, if what \u2013 is there a credible plan and strategy to narrow that gap in the next two to three years?", "And for years, you've talked about if you can move the mix more to SQ that will take care of it, but it doesn't seem to me that you've had much success with that, at least overall, because those margins are down several years in a row. And at that level of profitability, can you justify continuing to do M&A in the international waste business? It just seems like there's no way you're getting good returns if you can't really improve the profitability?", "Charles Alutto", "Yeah. I think I'm going to take that as two steps, one, I want to walk you through what are some of the pressures that we're facing currently, Gary, in that market. And then I'll take a stab at your question around long term, what do I think we can do there.", "So the pressure points and what we feel will be the pressure points for the rest of the year are in two distinct lines. It's first of all, it has to do with our patient transport business in the UK and obviously that's been one of our biggest contributors to our international cost pressures because it has rapidly grown over the last several years.", "We continue to experience an increase in the cost to operate certain contracts and as a result, that has had a pressure on the overall international margins. Just to educate everybody, most of that work was previously performed by the hospital, and as a result, it was difficult to get historical data prior to bidding. And what are we doing about that, how are we going to try to work on that? Well, the team is working diligently. They're working on these cost overrides, they're working on a contract-by-contract basis to see if these costs, some of them could be passed through our customers, and we may look at exiting some of those agreements. So that certainly is something that's been \u2013 it's a headwind in Q1. We think it will be a headwind for the rest of the year.", "The other issue we're facing is in Latin America. Obviously, the economic pressures in Latin America, especially Brazil, are impacting our business. The economic pressures are mostly in the form of now pricing pressure on government accounts. Just in Brazil alone, 58% of our medical waste volumes are tied to government contracts. When you think about Latin America, kind of a perfect storm for us. We have increased costs. We've talked about that last year. Usually, in Latin America, we can pass those costs along, but now we're experiencing some headwinds with respect to government accounts and being able to pass along those prices. So we'll continue to work on that certainly. The team is working on all fronts to improve margins over a longer period of time.", "Acquisitions, yeah, we'll look at certain markets and we will take a cautious stand on acquisitions. If it's a good tuck-in acquisition that has a good return in our core business, certainly, we'll look to complete that. We're not looking to add any new services, though, at this point until we can get the base business stabilized in some of the international countries.", "Gary Bisbee", "Okay. Thank you. And can I ask one quick follow-up just on the mathematical calculation for the share count and the converts? As I recall last quarter, you said that the beginning of period share price determines the formula, and I just don't get this 91.5 million shares based on the January 1 share price. I think the formula would say it would be more like 93 million. Is that -?", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Yeah. Let me take you through that, because I could see how you can get to that number. Remember, as a mandatory convertible, there's a range on this. So, anything below $136 \u2013 or let's put it this way. $136.25 is the maximum dilution of this, and that translates into 5.6 million shares. No matter where the price is below that, you will not see a greater converted share count. Anything above $136 up into $170 will then begin to become less dilutive and can actually go to as low as 4.5 million shares and never less diluted than that. So, Gary, at the level we're at right now, you will see no greater dilution than what it's at, and 91.8 million shares for the year is a good estimate to use.", "Gary Bisbee", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Charles Alutto", "Thanks, Gary.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Thanks. Good afternoon. Kind of segueing the discussion on international and acquisition, you made two in Europe. Is this just predominantly a Latin American issue where we wouldn't see acquisitions in that region for a while but you're still active in, I guess, ex-UK, the continent of Europe? Just some thoughts. And if you could talk about what those acquisitions were U.S. and international in the quarter. Thank you.", "Charles Alutto", "Yeah. Scott, the two acquisitions in Spain and Romania, I wouldn't read anything into that with respect to Europe or Latin America. They were two small tuck-in acquisitions around regulated medical waste. We'll look at acquisitions like we always have on a country-by-country basis, and if we feel that we need to do more integration work and improve margins before we do deals, then certainly that will come into our decision. So, I wouldn't look at it, acquisitions LATAM versus Europe.", "For the quarter, we had seven acquisitions. There were five domestic, two international. Brent gave you the Spain, Romania. Of the five domestic, one was regulated medical waste; four were secure information destruction. And as I've said before, the two international were regulated medical waste tuck-in acquisitions in Spain and Romania.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Okay. And if I could ask kind of a two part follow-up or...", "Charles Alutto", "Sure.", "Scott Schneeberger", "...it's probably two separates. Could you speak to RMS in the quarter? It looks like nothing too dramatic there versus trend. I saw you took down the high end of the guidance range for the year by $5 million, just what trends you're seeing. And then I'll ask my third question now with it.", "Just with \u2013 what should we expect to hear on the second quarter call, when you talk about working with the consultants and what you're assessing, what type of outputs are we going to hear? I mean, I know you're not going to quantify today, but what are the changes that are coming? Just if you could give us a taste. Thank you for answering both of those.", "Charles Alutto", "Sure, Scott. On the \u2013 your recall and returns question, we had solid growth this quarter versus the prior year's quarter, greater than 20% year-over-year. So the 24.8% compared to our 20% in Q1 of last year, so the team had a very good quarter. Obviously, it continues to an uneven business, difficult for us to even forecast.", "The only reason, to your question of why we brought the top end of the range down, which is after one quarter we still haven't seen that one blockbuster of really large recall. We would need a couple of those to get to the high end of the range, so we thought it was prudent just to shave the top end of the range down a little bit. But the team delivered solid quarter on all the industries: auto, food and beverage, pharma, med devices, consumer products. The team continues to do a really good job for us there, and we're excited about the opportunities in the quarters ahead.", "With respect to the consultant and what we'll talk about on Q2, I mean, obviously, we're looking at how best to organize the North America business. And it's all the businesses. It's ComSol and Expert. It's our Environmental Solutions. And more importantly, it's how do we take Shred-It and integrate that into all of our businesses and leverage the infrastructure that we have and really set us up for long-term growth. So I think when the Q2 call comes along, we'll talk about what the final outcome was. How did we structure ourselves? How are we going to have a better go-to-market strategy to utilize a better way to cross-sell our businesses?", "And at the same time, Dan and the finance team will look at, well, how are we measuring success in the new organizational structures internally and then how externally when we talk to our shareholders and our analysts about the different matrix on our business. So that's our anticipation talk track for the \u2013 I think we're set up well to talk about that on the July call, and those will be some of the topics we touch upon on our next earnings call.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Butler with Stifel. Your line is open.", "Brian Butler", "Thank you for taking my questions.", "Charles Alutto", "Hey, Brian.", "Brian Butler", "First one, just on the synergies, so you're looking at now $53 million in synergies in 2016. How does that play out over the quarters, and what is baked into the 2016 guidance from the perspective of the Stericycle synergies that you talked about in the back half?", "Brent Arnold", "Yeah. Brian. Let me kind of work with you on the synergy numbers. Our previous guidance was $51 million of synergies would be in 2016, with us pushing out these onsite-to-offsite conversions and reducing that by $20 million. We're now at $31 million we'll hit 2016. Those conversions will go throughout probably mid-2017. So we'll recognize the full $73 million in 2018.", "Daniel Ginnetti", "And, yes, those numbers are in the guidance.", "Charles Alutto", "And as far as the Stericycle synergies that you asked, Brian, the $20 million to $30 million, we've always said those will start in 2017 but be realized in 2018.", "Brian Butler", "Although you're going to start \u2013 so really, they're all 2017. You're not going to realize any of that in 2016?", "Charles Alutto", "Correct. And that is no change from the previous time we spoke about that.", "Brian Butler", "Okay. And is it possible to provide some kind of business line detail on either revenue and profitability, kind of going through the stuff outside of regulated medical waste such as the hazardous waste, the document destruction, patient communications?", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Yeah. Brian, I'll address that. And this really follows the conversation that Charlie just had below. I can give you certain averaging color. But remember, I think you should look for maybe some enhanced reporting once we go through the consultant review and how we run the business. We will report based on a true reflection of how we run the business. I think what you've asked for and that we have given historically is businesses like ComSol. From a gross margin standpoint, it's running at about company average with an EBIT in the low-teens, which is lower. It's more SG&A intensive, as you could imagine. Environmental Solutions has got gross margins in about mid-20s, and again, due to some of the costs that Charlie talked about, that's in the kind of the, probably just below double digits.", "And then Shred-It, where we've given you some historical on that and it's got EBIT margins in the \u2013 we tend to look at that, though, on an EBITDA, which is $16.5 million. I don't have the EBIT numbers for you but we've always talked to you historically from an EBITDA perspective and that's a low mid-$20 million business that we think over time from an EBITDA perspective, we can improve very well. So, I don't know if there's any more that you need on that, but I think that covers most of what we can give, really.", "Brian Butler", "Okay. And if I could just maybe tie one last one in there. On the regulated medical waste, on the domestic, at 5% growth organic, was there something \u2013 is that price or volume, and does that just \u2013 you see that recover just gradually through the rest of the year to kind of get into your targets, or is there something else that we've missed there?", "Charles Alutto", "Yeah. Keep in mind, Brian, the SQ growth and the LQ growth rate are not just medical waste. Over 50% of our SQ growth and 70% of our LQ growth comes from additional services, like ComSol, compliance services, Rx waste disposal, so that's not just medical waste. We actually did well on our growth rates. Although the SQ growth rates were 6% and 4%, if you adjust those growth rates for the impact of the fuel surcharge and the lower haz waste volume, it would have been more like a 9% and a 6% in the quarter.", "Brian Butler", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Joel Kaufman", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. It's actually Joel in for Isaac.", "Charles Alutto", "Hey, Joel.", "Joel Kaufman", "Just another one on the domestic medical waste business. Any update to your strategy with some of those large provider systems and IDNs, anything you guys may have learned from some of the deals you've struck thus far that you're using to negotiate any new contracts?", "Charles Alutto", "Yeah. I think you're referring to the Shred-It contract that we signed this quarter. I'll let Brent answer that, and I'll give you a little color on what we're seeing because I think you're also talking about IDNs, and I think we have some color there as well, but Brent can talk to you about what we're seeing early on, on the success in the secure information destruction for some of those LQ systems.", "Brent Arnold", "Yeah, Joel. Secure information destruction fits in really well with our LQ, our hospital sales force.", "As we've talked about in previous calls, we've got an account manager, a sales specialist model that has served extremely well for us to add on additional services with our customers, whether that be our Sharps Management Program, our pharmaceutical waste program or our hazardous waste program. This will feather in nicely with that as well. It's just one more solution we can bring our customers. We've had a lot of success adding on new services within healthcare and integrated networks. So, we're very bullish and confident we'll be able to do that very well.", "Charles Alutto", "And, Joel, just to give you a little color on just larger hospital systems in the U.S., we've always kept an eye on that. Obviously, you guys cover healthcare and you know the consolidation of SQ practices by hospital systems. We are starting to observe some longer sales cycles at these hospital-affiliated SQ customers.", "Remember, the decision-maker changes a little bit when the hospital acquires a doctor's practice. Where we've normally dealt with an office administrator or office manager, we're now dealing with more personnel from the hospital. So we believe we'll see some pricing pressure on hospital-affiliated SQ accounts as these contracts come up for renewal. But on the flipside, it does create an opportunity to sell a broader suite of more LQ-type services like pharmaceutical waste disposal, and our Sharps Management System.", "But \u2013 and to give you a little bit of color on that, we estimate that about 16% of our SQ accounts are now somewhat hospital-affiliated. Internally, Stericycle refers to that as a blend customer, and we certainly are keeping an eye on that consolidation and the decision-making process.", "Joel Kaufman", "Great. Very helpful there. Thanks. And then maybe one just for Dan. I think the interest expense came in a little light this quarter. Any update on what the expectation is for the year on the interest?", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Yeah. Interest was just a touch lower than guidance. And so I think if you were to look at the year, I think if you just brought it down about $1 million from what we shared last quarter from $106 million down to $105 million, I think that's a safe range to be in.", "Joel Kaufman", "All right. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Manthey with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.", "David Manthey", "Hi. Thank you. Dan, maybe you could give us Shred-It revenue, gross profit and EBIT contribution this quarter.", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Yeah. Let me take you through how they performed from a revenue standpoint. In the quarter, it was about $185 million, which is a good growth from last quarter. And remember, that number includes acquisitions, and so why I say good growth also, that's about up from $177 million, which was the acquired quarterly run rate. So pleased with the growth there.", "As we went through the bridge today, I did share with you that they had pulled some marketing costs forward. That affected the EBITA or EBITDA margins a little bit. And they saw some higher costs, but they're largely performing pretty well. I think from a guidance perspective in the rest of the year when you're looking at the model, they're running at an EBIT that when we delay the synergies now, I think it will be around 13.5% because we're moving those synergies out. We're going to pick those up next year. And then that accounts also for the changing paper prices. From an EBITDA perspective, just down by that about same amount, I think it was $200 million we gave you last time, about $184 million now.", "David Manthey", "Okay. Thank you. And then you mentioned Communications Solutions. Could you just give us an update there? I think STERICONNECT is fully implemented. When do you anticipate the growth inflection occurring in this service?", "Charles Alutto", "Yeah. Thanks, Dave. The new platform is live at STERICONNECT. Accounts, as we spoke about on the last call, are being transitioned on to the new system and this will continue throughout 2016. This is a very slow process, as we've said, to convert these customers onto the platform. Healthcare calls are very customized and they are customized on an account by account basis so it takes a long time to convert them into the new system. So far it's going well.", "At the same time, we'll be integrating our live voice infrastructure. That's the STERICONNECT system with our automated product portfolio, so things like automated appointment reminders, scheduling. So this will include a cloud-based automated scheduling and an automated appointment reminder service and this does put us in a very unique position vis-\u00e0-vis our competitors in the market. And actually, we had new growth for Q1 for ComSol and it was slightly ahead of our internal projections for the quarter. So they're off to a good start to the year.", "David Manthey", "Okay. Thank you. And then just lastly, Charlie, when you've talked about secure document destruction in the past, and the secular decline in paper overall, you've mentioned that once we get out there, say ten or 15 years from now, that the company will be providing additional data security services. I'm just wondering if you can give us a broad idea of what other non-paper based data security services you might be able to provide.", "Brent Arnold", "Hey, David. This is Brent. Some services, additional services that are available now that we look to expand is they've got hard drive destruction services. So while small, that's a new adjacent market that is a very large and profitable market we go after, and we also hope to develop the same type of compliance programs that we're very successful at selling to our SQ customers, and to roll that out kind of like a Steri-Safe for business \u2013 a business essentials package that we can take to those customers and hopefully sell through the large sales force they have, as well as our inside sales team.", "David Manthey", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Steinke with Barrington Research. Your line is open.", "Kevin Steinke", "Good afternoon, everyone. I think in the past you've talked about working to reduce your exposure to project-based industrial waste work and maybe even trying convert that to more of a recurring model. So is that something you're still thinking about or any progress on that front?", "Charles Alutto", "Yeah, Kevin. I think this is a good time maybe to take a step back and think about that business and tell you \u2013 and to really, by taking a step back and telling you why we got into and what the strategy is for the long run. If you think about it, six years ago, we identified two significant growth opportunities: retail and healthcare hazardous waste.", "And why do we think they're a good fit for Stericycle? They were a route-based business. They were SQ-type volumes. They came with complex regulatory issues for the generator of the waste, or the customer, and we had established relationships in a lot of those markets.", "So when we looked at it, we said the retail haz waste business was approximately $1 billion, and we still think that today. And the healthcare SQ haz waste market, we identified as at least a $1 billion market. And we quickly became the market leader in these growing segments, but unfortunately, as we spoke about before, we needed to add that operational infrastructure to support our growth.", "So we went out. We acquired PSC. We acquired other acquisitions to give us that additional facility in order to meet the demand of that growing business. Unfortunately, these acquisitions came with other hazardous waste streams: haz industrial waste, other hazardous waste, project work. And obviously, we're frustrated that this base revenue is shrinking, and most of this is really outside of our control and it's more market-driven. But we also have to look at what can we do better on the cost escalations on that business to make it better. But we needed the infrastructure. It came with some things that we didn't want to focus on.", "Where we're focusing, we are seeing really great growth in healthcare haz and retail haz. So, we continue to look at that as a focused part of the business, and we think over time, that will become a bigger part, and that will minimize the impact of this industrial and project work. And I think about why do we still think it's a good business. I mean, that's I'm sure a question of, should you guys be focused on this or not. And you think about recent enforcement action.", "Recently, Comcast announced a $26 million settlement in the State of California. It was related to two things. It was related to the improper disposal of hazardous waste and the disposal of secure information. So obviously, enforcement continues to build awareness, and I think this is a great example of how we have the ability to cross-sell a wide variety of compliance-related services over the customer base that we have or over one customer. So, that's really our strategy. It continues to be our strategy to focus on retail, healthcare, and SQ hazardous waste.", "Kevin Steinke", "Okay. That's helpful. And have you made any changes in the assumptions within your guidance for paper prices and do you continue to work on negotiating surcharges in contracts? I know that's kind of a longer term initiative, but any update there and also on what you're assuming for the paper pricing?", "Charles Alutto", "Sure. In Q1, started off as paper pricing increased by about $7.50 a ton from our last call. So last call it was at $126 as an average \u2013 at the end price of the quarter. At the end price of Q1, it's at $133.50 and that's what we assume now in our guidance going forward. Obviously, in Q1, you don't get the entire $133.50 because that grew incrementally over the quarter, but that's what Dan has used in the model right now is $133.50 or approximately $4 million for the rest of the year because of that slight increase.", "We are starting to look at contracts and make changes on agreements. That's done on a contract-by-contract basis. We know that will take us several years to implement and more to come on that in the coming quarters.", "Kevin Steinke", "Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Charles Alutto", "Thanks, Kevin.", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of [ph] Hansa Mizari with Sterne Agee. Your line is open.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hey. Good afternoon. Thank you. Just had one question. I know you guys are delaying some of the synergies to prevent disruption. But maybe if you could frame the upside, potential upside to synergies for investors longer term. Thank you.", "Charles Alutto", "Yeah. Let me take that, [ph] Hansa. I mean, when we think about, and one of the reasons we're going through the consultant study is that we think there will be an opportunity down the road when we're looking at markets that don't have density where we might be able to combine some routes. And have our drivers or the Shred-It drivers combine both medical waste and secure information on the same truck is by definition, those rural routes are not dense. They're not dense for secure information. They're not dense for regulated medical waste.", "So, one of the reasons we're taking up time on the study, one of those reasons we're taking time not to disrupt customers is because we know there will be opportunities over the next two, three, four years to improve both the operations of our Stericycle business and the Shred-It business. There will be things like we have a tech inside the hospital, collecting sharp containers.", "Our plan long term is to make sure if we have a hospital account to secure information destruction that that tech, while they're there, will collect all the secure information bins. So, we'll turn an account that used to take a secure information driver a long time to do, because they used to have to park their truck, walk throughout the hospital to collect all of these bins. We will have it waiting for that truck, and it'll be just another stop that they're picking up on their route. So, certainly, we're still excited about that. I think as we get closer to the Shred-It business, all the things we thought about, how closely it is related to Stericycle and what we do, we think there are things like that longer term that really set us up to improve the overall margin for Stericycle going forward.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Levine with Imperial Capital. Your line is open.", "Scott Levine", "Hey. Good afternoon, guys.", "Charles Alutto", "Hey, Scott.", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Scott.", "Scott Levine", "So, just to be clear, it sounds like the issues within the industrial haz waste are identical or very similar to the issues you experienced in 3Q of last year. I was hoping you might be able to confirm that, maybe elaborate on whether there's been any change whatsoever in either the types of customers that you're seeing the slowdown with or are there any differences between what you experienced here in 1Q versus what you experienced in 3Q of 2015?", "Charles Alutto", "Yeah. I think the big difference is what we experienced in Q3 was more fuel and energy related. And we saw that we were not going to pick up any part of that project or larger volumes in the foreseeable future. I think this is just we've seen a slowdown in the hazardous waste, excluding the retail on the healthcare haz, and we already knew that there would be some seasonality, and we adjusted for that. We just saw an actual decrease above and beyond seasonality. So I think that's the main difference. It's not as dramatic in this quarter.", "And then there's a mix issue where on the project works we did do, on the project works we did do in Q1, we did see a higher disposal expense related to that, just based on the type of project. And to be conservative, we wanted to make sure that we looked at Q1. And then we said, if that continues, what does that mean for guidance for the rest of year? Certainly, it's not as big as the drop-off in Q3, and I don't think it's related because I think Q1 was certainly related to fuel and energy, and this is just a softer hazardous waste market and manufacturing industry.", "Scott Levine", "And \u2013 sorry. Go ahead.", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Just to add to that, while we're facing all that, again, the focused areas that Charlie talked about, healthcare, hazardous and retail continue to have great growth.", "Scott Levine", "Understood. And is most of the pressure that you were assuming in the guidance change contained to Q1 or Q2, or are you kind of assuming this throughout the year?", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Yeah. As we gave guidance for the year, and I think Charlie already mentioned it, but it's about $0.10 to $0.11, and I would expect that to be spread evenly throughout the year.", "Scott Levine", "Got it. Great. Thanks, Dan.", "Charles Alutto", "Thanks, Scott.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Your line is open.", "Jason Rodgers", "Yeah. Just had a follow-up on the hazardous waste. How much revenue is left in industrial, in project work, and what is the expectation by year-end?", "Charles Alutto", "Yeah. If you think about some of the broad buckets, Jason, on the hazardous waste and the larger industrial and project work is about $100 million to $120 million. We talked about that last time. We have about $210 million to $220 million in the retail, healthcare hazardous waste bucket. There is bucket of just general hazardous waste, which is the remaining part of that, which is both small quantity, large quantity. There is some project work in that. But I think the thing that you're getting to is the larger industrial project work is about $100 million to $120 million.", "Jason Rodgers", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Barbara Noverini with Morningstar. Your line is open.", "Barbara Noverini", "Hey, everybody. Thanks.", "Charles Alutto", "Hey, Barb.", "Barbara Noverini", "So this is something that I think about when I think about the growth in your hazardous waste lines of business. So obviously, the beauty about your medical waste business is that it's basically a closed loop. You can pick up the waste and dispose of it through your own facilities primarily so \u2013 whereas in industrial haz, you're reliant on third party disposal providers, which increases your cost. Are you able to leverage any of your facilities to dispose of the healthcare or retail hazardous waste, or are you also reliant on third party disposal in those lines of business as well?", "Charles Alutto", "Yeah. The reason we focus \u2013 that we want to focus on the retail and the healthcare hazardous waste, Barbara, is there is an opportunity where we're bringing our material back to our TSDF [treatment storage disposal facilities] facilities. We can do \u2013 we can break that waste apart. We try not to use incineration or even landfilling that material. Sometimes we can remediate that material; sometimes it's used as an alternative fuel.", "So that's why our focus is there because that part of the business is not as dependent on disposal as is project or the larger industrial waste. And over time, we'd like to grow that so that the industrial and hazardous waste part of the business is just a baseline business for us and it's a smaller part of the larger business.", "And in our Rx waste, all of the non-hazardous pharmaceutical waste, we actually can utilize our medical waste facilities for that material. So we do have a closed loop on some of that non-haz pharmaceutical waste when we sell that product to a hospital or to a doctor's office. Even some of the mailbacks that we have and the take back programs, we'll actually utilize some our own \u2013 our goal is to utilize some of our own medical waste facilities. So we certainly \u2013 that's something we considered when we got into this business, when we looked at why we want to grow those particular segments.", "Barbara Noverini", "Great, great. That's good to hear. So going forward, we could reasonably expect that there will be opportunities to, let's call it, displace some of the industrial waste that's going through your systems at present. Maybe you'll be able to allow some of those contracts to, I don't know, roll off or something like that, but the goal would be to sort of use up that capacity with that other type of waste because it seems to me that your advantages are just stronger there.", "Charles Alutto", "Totally right. And I think, Barbara, you've followed Stericycle for a long time. So if you go back to the early days of Stericycle when we were mostly an LQ business and not making much profit, we had obviously 70% \u2013 65% to 70% of our business was LQ medical waste, and we focused for years on the SQ side of the business. We didn't get out of the LQ business because you need that as a base line for your facilities. But what did we do? Fast forward 15 years. 60% to 65% of our business now is SQ, and LQ, which still has a low profit to it, is a smaller part of the overall business.", "So this is going to take time; we realize that. But I think you've seen it before from Stericycle. We're focusing on those smaller markets that have better profitability where we can control our own destiny. We're not going to walk away from this hazardous waste from the larger industrial waste market, but we do want to make it a smaller part of that business over time.", "Barbara Noverini", "All right. Makes sense. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Presenters, I turn the call back over to you.", "Charles Alutto", "Thanks, Steve. Thank you, everyone, again for joining us on the call this evening. We'll see you all on the road during the quarter. Have a great night.

My name is Sara and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Stericycle Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.", "Sean McMillan, Vice President of Corporate Finance, you may begin your conference.", "Sean McMillan", "Welcome to Stericycle's second quarter 2016 conference call. I will now read the Safe Harbor statement. This conference call may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, for example, general economics and market conditions. Our actual results could differ significantly from the results described in the forward-looking statements.", "Factors that could cause such differences include changes in governmental regulations of the collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of regulated waste or the proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information; increases in transportation and other operating costs; the level of governmental enforcement of regulations governing regulated waste collection and treatment or the proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information; our obligations to service our substantial indebtedness and to comply with the covenants and the restrictions contained in our private placement notes, term loan credit facility and revolving credit facility; our ability to execute our acquisition strategy and to integrate acquired businesses; competition and demand for services in the regulated waste and secure information destruction industries; political, economic and currency risks related to our foreign operations; impairments of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangibles; variability in the demand for services we provide on a project or non-recurring basis; exposure to environmental liabilities, fluctuations in the price we receive for the sale of paper, disruptions in or attacks on our information technology systems; compliance with existing and future legal and regulatory requirements as well as other factors described in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "As a result, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results or trends. We make no commitment to disclose any subsequent revisions to forward-looking statements.", "I'll now turn it over to Charlie Alutto, CEO.", "Charlie Alutto", "Thanks, Sean. Thank you for joining us on today's call. In the second quarter despite softer than anticipated revenues, the team was able to provide strong sequential increases of profitability, which allowed us to deliver a solid quarter. We are pleased with the results given the time and effort that our team members invested in both running our business and implementing our recently announced organizational redesign.", "Joining me on today's call will be Dan Ginnetti, CFO; and Brent Arnold, COO. I'll now turn it over to Dan.", "Dan Ginnetti", "Thanks, Charlie. Before I give the numbers, I'd like to highlight some of the changes that will enhance our reporting and disclosure to our internal and our external stakeholders. Our Q2 press release included a global revenue table and additional non-GAAP disclosures.", "In our second quarter 10-Q, we will have changes to our opening segments. Our new operating segments are as follows. We will have a direct \u2013 domestic regulated waste and compliance solutions segments. This includes our compliance and logistics related services. We will have a domestic communications and related services segment. This includes our communication solutions and recall businesses. International regulated waste and compliance solution is another segment and there's no change to this operating segment.", "Now for the numbers. The results for the second quarter are as follows. Global revenues were $891.6 million, up 24.6% from $715.7 million in Q2 2015. And internal growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and manufacturing and industrial services was up 3.3%. Domestic revenues were $651.1 million, excluding the impact of acquisitions and manufacturing and industrial's revenues, internal growth was 2.3%.", "For consistency of your models, we will continue to report the following for the remainder of the year. Domestic regulated waste and compliance service revenue was $486.1 million, up 1%, SQ revenue was up 2%, LQ was up 1%, growth rates were impacted by lower fuel surcharges and lower manufacturing and industrial waste revenues. Recalls and returns revenue's was $20.9 million.", "International revenues were $234.5 million, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions, and manufacturing and industrial services internal growth was 5.8%. Acquisitions contributed $185.9 million to growth in the quarter. Gross profit was $381.6 million or 42.8% of revenues. SG&A expense excluding amortization was $189.5 million or 21.3% of revenues. Net interest expense was $24.4 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $37.3 million, or $0.43 per share on an as reported basis and $1.18 when adjusted for acquisition related expenses and other adjustments.", "Now for the balance sheet. Our covenant debt-to-EBIDTA ratio was 3.45 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of the revolver at the end of the quarter was approximately $506 million. In the quarter, we repurchased 32,962 shares of common stock on the open market in the amount of $3.1 million. And we repurchased 65,000 shares of mandatory preferred convertible shares on the open market in the amount of $5 million. At the end of the quarter, we have authorization to purchase 3.3 million shares.", "Our CapEx was $32.9 million, or 3.7% of revenues. Our DSO was 64 days. Year-to-date as reported year-to-date cash from operations was $245.4 million. And when adjusted for recall reimbursement and other items, cash from operations was $282.9 million. Today, we filed a Form 8-K reporting our decision to amend Stericycle's timing of quarterly accruals from legal settlements in 2015. The amendments will have no effect on our 2015 year-end financial results.", "I\u2019ll now turn it over to Brent.", "Brent Arnold", "Thanks, Dan. Worldwide, we continue to use our strong free cash flow to drive our growth through acquisition. In the quarter, we closed 10 acquisitions, 6 domestic and 4 international. The international acquisitions were one in Spain, one in Romania, one in South Korea, and one in the UK. Revenues from the 10 acquisitions were approximately $1.5 million in the quarter and annualized are approximately $10.6 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with well over $100 million in annualized revenues and multiple geographies and lines of business.", "In the quarter, we saw strong performance from the secure information destruction business. The sales team set a record for new sales and closed several new major national accounts. In addition, we continue to make progress toward our synergy plan and we remain on track with previous guidance. Overall, we are pleased with the momentum we are building in this new service line.", "As you are all well aware, over the last six months, we've been working with the consulting firm to optimize our organizational structure in the U.S. and Canada. In Q2, we began implementing the new structure. First, our sales organization was realigned to focus on growing our healthcare customer base, expanding national account relationships, converting the unbent secure information destruction market and expanding our multiple services across new and existing customers.", "Next, we established one field operations management organization for our regulated waste, compliance services and secure information destruction businesses. By having these operations aligned under one leadership team, we will drive best practices across the organization and provide best-in-class service to our customers. This will also enable us to drive long-term efficiencies and margin improvement. In addition, we have combined our recall and Communication Solutions businesses under one operating segment. This is a large \u2013 since a large portion of our recall businesses is call center related, we have consolidated the operations, sales and marketing and client service functions under one leadership team.", "Finally, we're developing a long-term plan to expand our shared services model across all of our businesses. Some of these shared services include IT, financial support, human resources and continuous improvement. When fully implemented, this plan will enable us to better leverage best practices and SG&A. We are excited about this new organizational structure. We believe this will allow us to drive team member engagement, better serve our customers and provide long-term sustainable growth. In closing, we would like to thank all of those team members, who contributed their time, effort, and input to this important organizational redesign.", "I will now turn it over to Charlie.", "Charlie Alutto", "Thank you, Brent. I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2016. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration and acquisition related expenses, and other adjusted items.", "Our guidance is adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange and the following factors. Currently, the overall hazardous waste market remains challenging. This has led to increased competition for available volume. These market conditions have further reduced the revenue and profitability of our manufacturing and industrial waste business. We are also seeing increased pricing pressure on our SQ customer base. This is a result of the consolidation of physician practices by hospitals and the overall healthcare cost pressures resulting from managed-care.", "To counter the SQ pricing pressure, we will be making incremental SG&A investments to drive new customer growth. With respect to our international business, we have negotiated a plan for SQ patient transfer contracts in the UK later this year. We will still incur costs while we transition out of these contracts. As a reminder, our 2016 EPS guidance is adjusted for amortization expense. For 2016, we believe the analyst EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.68 to $4.75.", "We believe that analyst revenue estimates for 2016 will be in the range of $3.56 billion to $3.6 billion, depending on assumptions for growth and the impact of foreign exchange rates. We anticipate 2016 internal growth rates to be SQ, 3% to 6%, LQ, 2% to 4%, international 3% to 5% and recall and returns revenue between $90 million and $100 million. We believe analysts will have estimates for free cash flow in 2016 between $435 million to $450 million. 2016 CapEx is anticipated to be between $125 million to $135 million. We expect the 2016 full-year as reported tax rate to be approximately 35.5%.", "We continue to be the market leader in multiple services and geographies with a strong team and an unmatched infrastructure. We recognize the challenges that our business faces and we continue to take steps to address these challenges. We remain confident in the long-term outlook of our business.", "With that in mind Stericycle will be hosting its first Investor Day and webcast on the morning of Thursday, November 10th to share perspectives on Stericycle's strategies, capabilities, and plans to drive long-term shareholder value. More details are posted on the events page of our Investor Relations website. We encourage investors, analysts, and the public to join in the live webcast or watch the meeting replay.", "Thank you for your time today. We will now answer any questions. Sara, you can open the Q&A queue.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels from William Blair. Your line is open.", "Ryan Daniels", "Thanks for taking the question. Dan, maybe I will start with one for you. It's been helpful in the past if you could provide EPS bridge. I know Charlie talked about SQ pressure, haz-waste and the U.K. contracts. Can you maybe break down a little bit how each of those are impacting the guidance versus prior expectations?", "Dan Ginnetti", "Sure, Ryan. As you know our prior guidance was $4.90 to $5.05. Acquisitions will contribute about a half a penny to a penny of EPS. Increased paper prices will add anywhere from $0.025 cents to $0.03 to EPS. Lower guidance on our recalls for the year will be unfavorable of about $0.02 to $0.04.", "FX, largely due to the Brexit will be a headwind of about $0.02. International, mostly due to the exit of the patient transportation contracts will be anywhere from $0.02 to $0.04 unfavorable. M&I, Manufacturing and Industrial, lower revenues, customer mix, and an Argentinian facility closure issue will be anywhere from $0.09 to $0.11 for the rest of the year and our regulated waste and compliance services will be about $0.10 to $0.13. That will bring you to $4.68 to $4.75 for the year. I think it would be best for your models in Q3 to have a range of about $1.17 to $1.21", "Ryan Daniels", "Okay. Great. Thanks for all that color. And then if we think about the McKenzie study and, Brent, some of the stuff that you outlined with shared services and operational redesign and consolidation. How much of the benefit to the cost structure if any did you see in the second quarter and then what type of margin improvements do you think that can drive either through accelerated sales or just better cost controls going forward. What's the corporate goal there?", "Dan Ginnetti", "Yes, Ryan. This is a good question. Overall, when we implemented the savings we saw about a $5 million savings associated with the changes that we've made in the second quarter. That was already in our previous guidance and were also looking to reinvest some of that as you heard with some of the additional resources we're going to put into the back half.", "We do think though that organizational redesign sets us up to continue to achieve the $31 million that we're on track to achieve in 2016 as well as a follow-on $28 million in the next year. So, again, we do think that the reorg is going to set us up for long-term growth and the ability to drive the necessary synergy letting cost improvements in the operation.", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes, Ryan, this is Charlie just to add a little bit to that. There was very little to your question around was there any savings in Q2 related to the study and implementation. I would tell you that very little was in Q2. The $5 million that Brent has alluded to was already in our guidance, on our previous guidance that we're going to invest now on the healthcare compliance business. And at the end of the day, the McKenzie study is going to help us hopefully exceed the $20 million to $30 million in the Stericycle and Shred-It synergies that we discussed when we did the Shred-It deal.", "Ryan Daniels", "Okay. Thanks for the color.", "Charlie Alutto", "Great.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sean Dodge from Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Sean Dodge", "Good afternoon, thanks. Dan and Charlie maybe if we look at the guide down as it relates to regulated medical waste the $0.10 to $0.13, can we drill down into that a little bit more. Is that all pricing pressure related to consolidation and with a quick follow on consolidation has been happening in this space for a long time now why we all seeing it or why are we seeing all of a sudden now?", "Brent Arnold", "Hey, Sean, this is Brent. I'll go ahead and take that one. This is not a new trend, right? We've been tracking this for quite some time. Really, managed care is having an impact in two areas with us.", "And as we've been following closely at first we did not anticipate or see it having a major impact initially but the challenge is, is now that these doctors practices that had been acquired by hospitals are starting to get integrated into their networks. We are starting to see continued pressures, those contracts come up and they put those out for large RFP\u2019s, we're starting to see increased pricing pressure associated with that. That's now having a material impact on our business.", "Secondly, we're seeing to a lesser extent we're also seeing the same trends now in our SQ business. As we go to renew those contracts we're also seeing pricing pressure and the need to do discounts to get new renewals.", "Sean Dodge", "Okay. So I guess the sequential step down then in the organic growth rates from the first to the second quarter and then for the rest of the year is purely your inability to get price that you assumed you were going to be able to get from those renewals?", "Charlie Alutto", "Is two factors, Sean, the price that Brent just spoke about, but remember we're also taking down we talked about the softness in the M&I business. So it's an impact of both the M&I and the future of the M&I for the rest of the year and the items that Brent just discussed.", "Sean Dodge", "Okay. Understood. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Gary Bisbee", "Hi, guys. Good afternoon. I just wanted to first clarify or confirm the new revenue reporting with which we obviously appreciate. Can you just go through and tell us exactly what's in the four new lines and then confirm what is going to be in your financial filings? So regulated waste and compliance, is that just med-waste or does that include the good part of has and then any color on this.", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes, the regulated waste would include and compliance services includes our regulated waste. It includes the additional services that we have been selling to our healthcare community and it also includes our hazardous waste. We did break out for you the M&I. We thought that was important for the shareholders it's gotten a lot of focus.", "It seems to be the one that's experiencing the headwinds and the volatility due to project work in the industrials. Our secure information distraction obviously with the new acquisition we look at that very closely. We thought it would be important also for our analysts and shareholders to be able to see the growth of that business and how it's contributing to the overall growth of Stericycle.", "And then communication solutions and recall coming together, has really been a natural over the last year or so as we've seen more and more recall that we're doing, the really call-center type work and we've been able to leverage our call center agents and we thought it was really important to make that one group.", "Gary Bisbee", "Okay. Great. And in the filings you said you're just going to add one segment which is the comp segment. Did I catch that right?", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes. The operating segment will be a combination of the Recall business and the Communication business, which will then change the regulated waste and compliance services segment a little bit in its nature.", "Gary Bisbee", "Okay. Great. Are you going to provide us a time series of this new revenue break down historically or we're going to wait four quarters to get the historical?", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes. I think as we're reporting right now, you are getting a one-year look back and on Q4 you would get two additional years. So at the end of the year you would get 2016, 2015 and 2014. What could give you the look at that Gary? This is a brand-new report out there and so, as we're out there we'll provide feedback when we can, but as of right now at the year over year and at the end of the year you get a three-year.", "Gary Bisbee", "Great. And thanks for that and one other \u2013 by the way we appreciate the extra color looking to that revenue. And then just one operational one, I guess, Charlie, at what point do you decide that some of these businesses you\u2019ve ventured into just are not up to the historical Stericycle quality around profitability potential or stability of revenue and look to maybe consider other exits than those British contracts. Is that on the table? Have you thought about it? Is the board considering these things or do you feel like in a reasonable timeline you can start to fix some of the damaged businesses and not just grow your way out of it by growing Shred-It? Thank you.", "Charlie Alutto", "No, obviously we continue, we've always looked at the businesses and whether or not they fit the long-term strategy. I mean certainly in this quarter you saw that we started taking steps at least in the patient transport business in the UK although we're still in that business we were able to exit two contracts. We'll continue to look at that on a contract by contract basis. And then we'll review whether or not that business fits in the long-term strategy.", "And I think really the focus has been on the manufacturing and industrial business and whether or not do we expand that business. I want to maybe take a step back before I answer that one. I mean we got into that business because we needed to build the infrastructure as we said before to support our core strategy around retail, healthcare, SQ hazardous waste and those services continue to grow and they do fit the Stericycle model. They are predictable and stable.", "We\u2019ve made the PSC acquisition and a few of our acquisitions overseas, we did \u2013 the hazardous waste dynamic at that time, were good. They were growing. M&I was strong. However, since the market conditions obviously have deteriorated, we are currently evaluating all options there. And that's an option around do we need the infrastructure we currently have to support the predictable and stable parts of that business? Are there parts of that business that don't belong in the portfolio? And we'll look at that over the next two quarters. Certainly we'll look at that.", "Gary Bisbee", "Great. Thank you.", "Charlie Alutto", "Thanks, Gary.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman from Stifel. Your line is open.", "Michael Hoffman", "Thank you, Charlie, Dan and Brent for taking my questions. Just to work through the model, Dan, you gave an SG&A number, which I'm assuming is net of amortization and adjustments. So that's what I'd call a core SG&A. That was about 180 million, is that 0.9, is that the way to think about it, it's going to be 180 a quarter for a while? And then I have another one.", "Dan Ginnetti", "You might well have been seen that we've been getting to \u2013 really at the beginning of the year look at things from an EBITDA perspective. It's appropriate for us to look at SG&A absent amortization.", "I'm sure in middle of the quarter when you looked at it, you did see a spike up in amortization expense. I think it probably appropriate to address that since you've asked that question. As we finalize the purchase accounting for the Shred-It deal. There was a recommendation by the third-party we utilized to do the purchase accounting to increase the value of our customer relations and at the same time reduce the period, over which we amortize that.", "And that's what you saw a one-time spike in amortization. But even prior to that, we began looking at the business absent that. And so I do think it's appropriate when looking at it to continue to do that. And I think you've seen a little bit of improvement in the SG&A number. And I think you should show what you're looking at is pretty stable.", "But as Brent mentioned we are going to make investments in SG&A to be able to ramp up the growth in the areas that Brent discussed.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. So digging into that you had 18.3 million in amortization the first quarter, but a 51 number in the second. What's the sustainable number?", "Dan Ginnetti", "It will be about $29 million per quarter.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. And the integration expense running at 22, 23, is that the path for the rest of this year?", "Dan Ginnetti", "I think that's a reasonable number for the rest of the year, integration is ongoing. We're in the very early stages, having just really announced this restructure in May, which is largely due in integrating two very impressive companies. And so I think for \u2013 at least for the year I would expect those levels to stay relatively consistent.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. And then just I\u2019m sort of unclear on what\u2019s happening in the healthcare business domestically. If you stripped away the ancillary services and hazardous waste, retail and healthcare hazardous waste. What I\u2019m hearing is that you had a net decline in the domestic business?", "Charlie Alutto", "No, I think if you \u2013 there\u2019s a few things, Michael, I think you got to think about when you\u2019re looking at the recent quarter. One, when you compare Q2 of this year to Q2 of last year, there is a comparable issue because of the weather related events even in our med waste business in Q1 of 2015. And then I think if you adjust for the lower fuel surcharges, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s accurate to say we had a net decline. It wasn\u2019t like historical numbers, but there was a positive increase in that business.", "Brent Arnold", "Michael, you remember there was a $51 million in incremental revenue from Q1 to Q2. I think when you\u2019re looking at the growth rates, looking at the first half of the year is a better more realistic perspective of what\u2019s going on than just looking at Q2.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay, fair enough. But even if I come to all that groups, you\u2019re in a zero to 1% on the traditional go collect and burn it or autoclaving in medical waste business?", "Charlie Alutto", "No. I think when you look at the regulated waste group together, I think if you add back 0.5% to 1% on fuel charges, I think your rate \u2013 you\u2019re between 1% and 2%, Michael?", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay.", "Charlie Alutto", "And that doesn\u2019t include the obviously the additional services where we\u2019ve spent most of our time trying to grow over the last quarters [ph].", "Michael Hoffman", "Right. I got that. So how much of what\u2019s been going on has distracted the cross-selling of let\u2019s push more sharps, push more pharma, upsell the Steri-Safe? Was retail and healthcare hazardous waste double-digit like it was in 1Q? I mean, what\u2019s happening in those items?", "Charlie Alutto", "I would say we continue to have strong growth in all three of the hazardous waste segments we focus on, right. Retail, pharmaceutical waste and hospitals, as well as SQ haz-waste. So all three of those continue to do well. I would bring it back to the market dynamic that we\u2019re facing and M&I is really one of the major contributor\u2019s, as well as then...", "Michael Hoffman", "Brent, I don\u2019t mean to interrupt, but I got the M&I part. I\u2019m trying to understand inside $517 million of revenues is a hazardous waste business, did that hazardous waste business show the double-digit growth rate that it had?", "Charlie Alutto", "No. It was higher single-digits. It came down a little bit and I think some of that had to do with quarter-to-quarter comparable as well.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay.", "Charlie Alutto", "And you\u2019re looking at us, yes, that\u2019s correct.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. And was there any impact in the cross-selling efforts because of all of the things that have been going on? And you can regain momentum or have we hit a new normalized point of year-over-year change in cross-selling, the Steri-Safe, sharps, pharma?", "Charlie Alutto", "I think Michael it\u2019s tough to tell whether that had an impact on cross-selling. But it probably has an impact which we believe is \u2013 we didn\u2019t move aggressively on the pilots on adding secure information destruction during the redesign as we were bringing those two teams together. But I wouldn\u2019t say that there was a distraction on the field sales team on selling additional services. I mean that does fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, but I wouldn\u2019t say \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t want to pin the redesign on any issues with our cross-selling activities.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. And in the redesign you went from 13 districts in the old Stericycle, 55 in Shred-It, what are we looking and Shred-It had sales marketing and operations, Stericycle just had operations. What does that look like now total number of districts where sales and marketing sitting and how do we think how that all works?", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes, from the reorg perspective again, we put all of operations under one leadership, so we\u2019ve got eight different regions that now run all of the operations associated with our combined business. And then sales and marketing is at the compliance, at the overall business unit level so to speak.", "The sales organizations are set up like we talked about. We focused them on key customer groups and so we\u2019re really looking at things like retail and national accounts, hospitals, non-healthcare, all of those really focusing how can we drive our business both new accounts and additional services in those different channels.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. And just so I\u2019m clear on the eight regions, so that has M&I, operations, communications and related services operations, document destruction, regulated medical waste or this is regulated medical waste document destruction operations only?", "Charlie Alutto", "Right now it\u2019s medical waste and document destruction. The plan would be to eventually, potentially put all the different businesses which would be our hazardous-waste business, no Michael, this does not include communication and recall were combined. It\u2019s not in the operational business that Brent just described.", "Michael Hoffman", "All right, and if it goes eight regions there, obviously there\u2019s another level below that or is eight regions that\u2019s used under the eight the regions and that\u2019s it?", "Charlie Alutto", "No, it\u2019s the eight regions and then within each region there\u2019s either a Shred-It district and/or HCS district.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. All right. Great. Thank you.", "Charlie Alutto", "Thank you, Mike.", "Michael Hoffman", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Hi, thanks. I guess, could we talk international, the trend is decelerating in the second half and year-over-year comps. You\u2019ve addressed it kind of broadly. Could you address \u2013 kind of, international? And then a little bit more color on patient transportation.", "And then the third part of this question would be, in Latin America you said its something in Argentina, I missed. And then kind of an update on how you\u2019re doing with your Latin American government related customers and what\u2019s occurring with them, if that was a headwind noted last call. Thanks.", "Charlie Alutto", "Sure, Scott, jump in if I missed anything, because you had a couple of parts to that question. So international growth rates for the quarter were approximately 6% and that was driven higher in the quarter by a good communication solution and recall activity overseas. We did bring down the full-year guidance there and that is directly related to the exit of the patient transport contracts in the second half of the year.", "A little more color on the patient transport business and what that meant with respect to the quarter, our guidance is, we have negotiated an exit on two contracts later this year. We are going to still incur cost while we transition out of these contracts. And if you think about what is the headwind for that particular one, I think Dan addressed early on the bridge there about $0.02 to $0.04 to EPS for the rest of the year.", "As far as \u2013 you had your question about Argentina. We do have a facility that was shut down, will be shut down for most of the rest of the year. It had to do with heavy rains in the Buenos Aires areas earlier on that facility shut down, I think, around April. So it did had some impact a little bit for us in Q2.", "And your last question related to government contracts in Brazil, and we talked about that that we are having issues taking some of the increases we have on wages and passing that through. There\u2019s nothing new there. That hasn\u2019t worsened. We didn\u2019t think it was going to get better that\u2019s why we guided down a little bit on that on the last call. But there\u2019s really no update there. It\u2019s still a tough situation with respect to Latin America. We continue to try to work the best we can contract by contract in getting increases passed through. I believe I caught all of your questions.", "Scott Schneeberger", "You did. Yes, great. You covered them all. A follow-up on the patient transportation in the UK, exiting two contracts what is left and what I assume everything will be exited ultimately. What\u2019s the timeframe?", "Charlie Alutto", "We haven\u2019t necessarily made a decision on the ultimate exit of that business. Yes, we did exit two agreements. We\u2019re left with about $65 million to $75 million in annualized revenue after the exit. That number though has also come down with the exchange rate headwind in the UK. If you remember the last call I talked about that business being $85 million to $95 million.", "So about half of the reduction that I just spoke to came from foreign exchange, the other half came from the exit of those contracts. There are about 30 contracts in total. Again, we\u2019re looking at this on a contract by contract basis. Certainly we\u2019re looking at some contracts that are unprofitable that we\u2019re looking to exit. And then we\u2019ll make a decision on the long-term strategic fit of that business.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Okay, thanks. And just one final quick follow-up. Is the restructure over now? Or the redesign or whatever you guys \u2013 the McKinsey study in the diagnostics. What should we anticipate looking ahead? I assume you\u2019re still going to guide the out year on the third-quarter call. So just kind of curious what additional changes we\u2019ll see in reporting going forward? And just operational fundamental is all the consulting is gone and the new processes in place? Thanks.", "Charlie Alutto", "Yeah. As far as the major changes, we tried, Scott, to bucket those together. Obviously, from an organizational perspective, you don\u2019t want to just have change after change happening. So we tried to bucket as many of those together. But at Stericycle, one of our core values is continuous improvement. So we\u2019ll always be looking to make the necessary changes to continue to improve and drive our business.", "With regard to upcoming changes that you\u2019ll start to see, I referenced the consolidation or virtualization of our inside sales team, that\u2019s something we\u2019re working on. We\u2019re currently working on also using all the expertise we have in customer service to bring all that together, use our technology around call quality, call routing, intelligent work distribution, all of those things. So these are things that we\u2019re just a few years ahead in our journey than Shred-it was. And I think we have a lot of opportunities to continue to make margin improvements, as we take the expertise we\u2019ve had and having all the logistics-based business that used to be decentralized and really pulling all of this and using that same expertise and best practice and taking that to Shred-it.", "But the final thing I\u2019ll add is we are continuing a couple engagements with the consultants. Some around sourcing and some around customer data and information and we\u2019re excited about those projects.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Okay, thanks. And just quickly speaking, any thoughts on segment reporting or changes in the third quarter, I guess, Dan, for you on the guide that we should think about now? And thanks for taking all these questions. I appreciate it.", "Dan Ginnetti", "Yes I think we showed you what we\u2019re prepared to do and what we think fits. Obviously, it\u2019s a representation of how we\u2019re running the business. As far as the revenue table, it\u2019s not only how we run the business, but it\u2019s also providing information we thought would be meaningful for you too. I think everything that we have at least in the near term is laid out to where we planned for it to be.", "Charlie Alutto", "Thank you Scott", "Scott Schneeberger", "All right. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Manthey from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.", "David Manthey", "Thank you. Hi, guys. When you look at the declines in the SQ, LQ, international growth rates, is that all volume and fuel surcharges or is there a component of price declines also?", "Yeah. So I\u2019ll take that, David. So, again, I think, when you\u2019re looking at growth rates, you should look at the full year because I think that takes out the comparable issues. So I\u2019ll answer it with that view in mind. So we obviously had a big influx of revenue in Q2 of last year. So the main contributors are lower M&I and lower fuel surcharges.", "Certainly, we\u2019ve seen some of this SQ pricing start to build now. So there is a component of that in Q2. When you adjust though for all of those impacts, the impacts around M&I and the lower fuel surcharges, we would have been at a comparison of about 6 SQ and 4 LQ.", "And then, I think, it begs the question around, well, what does that mean going forward into 2017? So, when we \u2013 obviously, we're going to provide our exact guidance on the 2017 on the October call. However, some of the headwinds we've discussed here today around M&I and around our regulated compliance solutions business will continue into next year. So we anticipate the 2017 growth rates will be lower than the historical averages.", "David Manthey", "Okay. And then you talked about M&I and potentially thinking about getting out of that business or somehow stripping out those revenues and not being in the business anymore. If that were to happen though, wouldn't it stand to reason that what was left of PSC would be underutilized? You may have to close facilities, shift further to get there? I'm just trying to understand how that would happen because at a conference back in June, Dan had talked about the volumes sort of indicated that you would take those volumes day of the week because if they were helping you maximize the utilization of your facilities.", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes, David, so, a good question. First of all, no assumptions right now. We have not made any decisions to sell any part of our hazardous waste business. That includes obviously our retail, healthcare in SQ or M&I, our manufacturing and industrial. One of the reasons to call it out on the table is that obviously has a lot of unpredictability to it, so from an analyst and a shareholder perspective, we wanted to call that out. If we made a decision to sell or to move away from a business, we certainly would look at what's left from an operational infrastructure and make the proper adjustments to make sure that we can run a very predictable, stable and profitable business. We wouldn't just leave and then try to figure out what the infrastructure would look like afterwards. That would all be part of the overall decision.", "David Manthey", "Okay. And then somewhat related as it relates to the structures of these businesses, you talked about the difficulty in converting on-site shredding customers to off-site and if there's a handful of holdouts customers that back of hold up the entire process of gaining synergies, given the structure of your trucks and things like that, is it wrong to think that that would extend beyond the initial integration for example to acquire a document destruction target a year from now, two years from now, wouldn't you have the same difficulty integrating that route into an existing route if there's a number of customers that want their paper to be shredded on-site?", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes, David, maybe I didn't communicate this as well in the past but we will always have on-site customers and we are going to offer both services going forward. So for those customers who want their documents destroyed on-site, we'll always have those resources and assets. Our focus has been moving percentage of those to where more of them are on-site versus on-site. So, yes, we will always be going through this process \u2013 as leading customers know the two different ways that we can handle their documents and then helping guide them to the most appropriate one that meets their needs. So this will be an ongoing process. Clearly, it's more efficient for us to do it off-site but if they want it on-site, we will continue to do that as well.", "Just a little more color there, they remember to think off this business is both on-site and off-site. They had about 60% of their customers off-site but they offered on-site and they had 40%. All were saying now is the combined entity during the integration period will get the combined entity to 60% off-site and the remainder on-site. But I think it's a key point I've seen some articles out there about Stericycle is getting out of the on-site business. That is not accurate. That is not part of the plan.", "David Manthey", "Okay. And then final question, are the consultants still there or are they gone?", "Dan Ginnetti", "No, as a mentioned earlier, consultants now have moved on to a sourcing project as well as the data project. So we've moved on to two other smaller projects but once that we are very interested in.", "David Manthey", "Okay. All right. Thank you.", "Dan Ginnetti", "Thanks, David.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Barbara Noverini from MorningStar. Your line is open.", "Barbara Noverini", "Hey, good afternoon, everybody.", "Dan Ginnetti", "Hey, Barbara.", "Barbara Noverini", "So it's interesting to see organic revenue decline for the quarter in the new communications segment and I assume much of that is related to the recall business but given that recall is such a lumpy business including it in the segment sort of the masks underlying growth of console, which you have talked about in the past as a nice growth platform for you. So I understand it's a pretty steady recurring revenue stream kind of business. So if you were to exclude recall how did that console business perform and what could we expect for that going forward?", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes, so the few things I'll point out. And then I think you brought up some good questions there, Barbara. First of all when we looked at combining the business, the first thing we looked at was that 60% of recalls revenues were call-center related. As you know recalls consistent on retrieval, disposal, notification and call-center but the lion share of the work there was call-center.", "So there was a lot of synergies and we've been working for more than a year trying to figure out how do we leverage our communications solutions team to take those recall works which is lumpy, in nature. So that was one of the thought process of bringing the two together.", "Secondly on your question around, what is the growth rate if we exclude some things? And recall, certainly was down this quarter, it was $20.9 million. It was down to 26% year-over-year. So let\u2019s remove the noise there on the number. I think the team, the console team and the recall team did a good job of winning auto call-center contracts which we utilized the communications solutions team for. So they assist in vehicle buybacks and customer care related work. So when you strip out the noise and you exclude the U.S. recalls, the Europe recalls and acquisitions, year-to-date growth in console was actually about 11%.", "I caution you a little bit about moving forward there. We have some year-over-year comps in Q3 but we are, we think about it, how do we get that work in console in the auto space, it started with an acquisition that we made of a company that had a relationship with auto manufacturers.", "They were able to pass along where we got some small recall events in auto, but really then we able to work with communications solutions and we are now doing some large work for auto manufacturers like I said in the area of vehicle buybacks and customer care work. So, if you think about it it's worked very well with tuck-in acquisition we extended the services they can offer and it is paying off nicely for that part of the business.", "Barbara Noverini", "Got it. Thanks for the additional detail.", "Charlie Alutto", "Thanks, Barbara.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Joel Kaufman", "Hi guys thanks, this is actually Joel in for Isaac.", "Charlie Alutto", "Hey Joel.", "Joel Kaufman", "So, any color on what you guys are seeing in terms of pricing within a document destruction side of the business? And then maybe any insights on your plans to integrate paper pricing surcharges into any of the newer contracts that you've been signing?", "Brent Arnold", "Hey, Joel, this is Brent. With regard to pricing \u2013 with regard to market pricing again, haven't noticed any major changes or differences in the trends when we got into business. One thing that we're really excited about though is, the size of the unwind market and the ability for our team to go out there and convert it. And can convince those customers that it is better to outsource that service as opposed to either be noncompliance or two Shred-it themselves.", "So obviously when we go out and convert that business we're able to kind of set the value with a customer and we do really well there. With regard to the paper pricing, we're happy to come back. And so hopefully will continue to see it come back to more of that 150 historical level, but so far it's on the right trend.", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes, and right now, I mean it's about 146. So its not that far off of that 10 year, we talked about that five-year to 10 year average of 152, so we are pleased that it's come back and talked about, that's created a little bit of a tailwind process in that business.", "Dan Ginnetti", "And I think you're also asking about question of getting language into the contracts and as we mentioned that would be as the contracts cycle about four years, we would be migrating that in. So that will take time to implement over the whole contract base.", "Charlie Alutto", "And the good news there is that the team has made strides to getting that language in the new agreements that were signed, so we're moving forward on that front.", "Joel Kaufman", "Great. Thanks. And then maybe just to clarify, on the SG&A investments you guys discussed in the context, offsetting some of the pricing pressure in SQ, was that back half of 2016 phenomenon or was that something that you would be implementing over the longer term?", "Dan Ginnetti", "Correct. That's going to be over the \u2013 the initial investments will be in the back half of about 4 million to 5 million in the back half of 2016. And where we're going to put that is incremental sales and marketing. And we're going to really focus that on driving additional services and the SQs that have been acquired by hospitals.", "The reality is that they still need the services that we have, whether that be pharmaceutical waste or our compliance training services so \u2013 or sharps management service. We just feel like we need additional resources to help get out there and push that forward.", "And then the second part will be a new part for us, which is really exciting. As you think about it, most of our sales process in the past has been upselling existing customers to additional compliance services. We have a large market opportunity with regard to an incremental site in the SQ market and so we're excited about proactively approaching and gaining those sites with this sales investment.", "Joel Kaufman", "Great. Thanks.", "Charlie Alutto", "Thanks, Joel.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Steinke from Barrington Research. Your line is open.", "Kevin Steinke", "Good afternoon. Could you provide the bridge from prior revenue guidance to the updated revenue guidance as you did for EPS and also what's the full-year impact of currency incorporated into guidance now?", "Dan Ginnetti", "Yes, I'd be happy to do that. Revenue, as you know before, the prior guidance was 3.6 billion to 3.66 billion. The Q2 lower revenues will create unfavorable of about 10 million for the guidance going forward. The lower expert guidance will be 5 million to 15 million. The environmental solutions will be about 10 million in the back half of the year. SQ growth that we talked about is anywhere from 10 million to 15 million in the back half of the year. Exiting that patient \u2013 those two patient transportation contracts will be between 7 million and 12 million on the back half.", "And in the acquisitions that we did will contribute about 5 million. Foreign exchange, and I think I'm going to answer both questions with this one. The Brexit will create about 10 million in foreign exchange headwinds, most of it had to do with the Brexit. And then the improvement in paper prices is about 5 million. If you look at that it will bring it to about 3.56 billion to 3.60 billion in revenue for the year, guidance.", "Kevin Steinke", "All right. Got it. Thank you very much. And I'm not sure if you touched on this earlier, but you mentioned that last quarter that you had some good success cross-selling document destruction services to some healthcare customers and you also cited some new wins this quarter. So, where do we stand on the cross-selling efforts of information destruction to healthcare and are you now setting up the team to sell those services more aggressively to the legacy Stericycle customer base?", "Dan Ginnetti", "Yes, Kevin, Charlie commented a little bit on this earlier, but I\u2019ll just reiterate. The sales pileups are going well. We did have to keep them relatively smaller and scale just with the magnitude of things that we had going on with the organizational redesigns. But they had contributed to the success in new revenue or new sales that tried to had in Q2.", "And overall we\u2019re very pleased with the progress that the organic growth is making anywhere from 3% to 5% which is high \u2013 probably higher than historical averages. We look to accelerate that the investments which regard to cross-selling. I think that\u2019s the way the new sales organization we set it up to sell all services. It\u2019s going to be a great plus there. So again, we\u2019re still in the process of learning lessons and continuing to pilot the ones that where best we will fund and we will accelerate those in the back half of year and in to next year.", "Charlie Alutto", "And just to add a little color, I\u2019ll give you the example Kevin on the LQ, what part of the redesign on the organizational redesign is that, our hospital group, which is led by \u2013 that's one of the segments that Brent talked about, they will have embedded specialists that can sell secure information instruction to those customers.", "It's a similar model that we followed for Sharps Management, for our Med/Waste, that team is always delivering solid results. When we use the major account executives relationships and hospitals to bring in those specialists to get that cross-selling activity signed and brought into the company. So we're excited about that. That was part of focus. Certainly we had to get through the redesign and now we're gearing up that team to be within the hospital sales team for Stericycle.", "Kevin Steinke", "All right, helpful. Thanks for taking the questions.", "Charlie Alutto", "Thanks, Kevin.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Larry Keusch from Raymond James. Your line is open.", "Larry Keusch", "Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. I want to start on the patient transports and the $65 million to $75 million in revenue that you mentioned after you exit the two contracts. How do we think about sort of the economics of that remaining revenue? So, in other words, is there a portion of that business that makes sense, or should we really be thinking about you looking to exit these contracts over time because, again, just the overall economics just don't make sense, and they aren't going to change?", "Dan Ginnetti", "Larry, I would tell you that about \u2013 some four years ago when we were in \u2013 we started to get into the patient transport business in the UK. It came with a Med/Waste acquisition and for a couple of years and some of those smaller contracts that we were winning in the north of England and other parts of the UK, they were profitable.", "That profitability was very similar to our Med/Waste business. And as we discussed we went into this business thinking that the NHS was going to outsource this and the large trenches of contract. We were correct on that, but we've had difficulty setting up and delivering on a profitable basis in that marketplace.", "So, you're right, as we start to look at the unprofitable contracts there are some contracts, legacy contracts and contracts \u2013 smaller contracts that we\u2019ve won over the last several years that are profitable. And that's why we'll take a step back at that point to figure out what we do next? Do we sell that business? Do we stay in that business? We really need to look at it on a \u2013 we always thought that this was a UK centric approach. It wasn't going to expand to other markets and we just have to make sure that it fits in the long-term strategy of that business given the fact that we remain small and probably won't grow.", "Larry Keusch", "Okay. Perfect. That's helpful. And then I just wanted to come back and just see if we can deconstruct a little bit the comment around the pressures being driven by managed care. So, I understand the dynamics of former SQ customers now being negotiated under LQ contracts. But where does specifically managed care hit the business?", "Dan Ginnetti", "Well, I think where managed care hits the business the most, right, is the trend of the physicians practice being acquired by hospitals. So early stages when that happened we didn't see a material impact, but naturally as you can imagine, right, renegotiating the Med/Waste contract was not the first thing on those hospital administrators listed up to-do as when they bought those 300 doctors practices.", "We're finding now they're getting around to that part of the integration and as those renewals come up, you can imagine, right, the purchasing power of IDNs as they put those out to bid can't be significant. So that's one aspect of it.", "The other is just with the local and regional competition and just the unaffiliated SQ looking to save more money as their reimbursements going down. We are noticing an increasing amount of discounting that we need to make to renew those agreements. So again, it's not like the business is declining. This is just cutting into our overall SQ growth.", "Larry Keusch", "Okay. Got you. Okay, I think the disconnect was it sounds like you're talking about the trend of hospitals acquiring physicians private practices and making them employees versus I thought there was some true managed care from a managed care provider angle which doesn't sound like that.", "Dan Ginnetti", "No. No, no. Good clarification. That's not the case. This is just a matter of hospital XYZ, over time it would acquire 100 doctor practices. As those agreements come up, they look to put them all out for RFP. We are usually well positioned because we have very good service and are fully integrated to Windows, but it's just a matter of it puts pricing pressure from their previous price to now the new negotiated price from the hospital system.", "Charlie Alutto", "And Larry, part of the investment that Brent talked about is we have other additional services that we think play well in hospital affiliated accounts. Things they care about pharmaceutical waste disposal, reusable shards. Part of investment is to make sure that even though the decision might be delayed because now it's not made by an office manager it's made by hospital, that we want to make sure from a marketing and a sales perspective that we have an opportunity to drive the additional services to that hospital group.", "Larry Keusch", "Okay. That makes sense. And then last one for you, and I don't know how much you can help on this, but I think you mentioned in the past that perhaps that if you looked at the SQ group that was now, again, sort of being negotiated under LQ terms, it was around 16%. And I guess what I'm just trying to wrap my arms around a little bit is, it sounds like this may be \u2013 you will try to offset this and sell more services, but it sounds like this could be a headwind for certainly the foreseeable future.", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes. I think it will be an ongoing headwind until we get through the renewal phase obviously, but I think the number was more like 18% to 20% and the reason it's a range Larry that sometimes the doctor gets acquired and we don't know. We continue to service the account under that contract. And when the renewal comes up for further down the line maybe a year after the hospital acquired it, it\u2019s a breakpoint, they don't really \u2013 this is not something that's top on their list. Then we will get a notification.", "So one thing that we do have in our favor is the data that we have seen is that the consolidation seems to have peaked at this point. And I don't think this will be growing every year or becomes 25%, 50%, at least based on the data that we see today.", "Larry Keusch", "Yes, I would concur with that. Okay. Thanks very much.", "Charlie Alutto", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Levine from Imperial Capital. Your line is open.", "Scott Levine", "Hey, good afternoon, guys.", "Charlie Alutto", "Hey, Scott.", "Scott Levine", "I just want to push on that last point a little bit more and make sure I understand this correctly, because it would seem like the kind of issue that would develop over time and it seems like it's all kind of hitting home pretty quickly and in one shot. Am I thinking about it correctly or is this a trend that has been developing for a period of time that's really coming to a head here in the second quarter? Maybe just a little bit more color on how this issue has evolved affecting the pricing in particular in the core business?", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes. I think if you look at this \u2013 certainly has been something that we've looked at for many years. We actually have been within the company we call it blended account, hospital affiliated accounts. Certainly it's been a trend. We've seen over the years some pricing pressure not really material to the overall numbers. We did see it increasing in Q1 and that's why we kind of spoke about it on the last call.", "We saw that trend continue and more contracts get renegotiated in Q2. And we\u2019re taking that data that we have now, Q1 and building Q2, and now were applying it in our guidance on a go forward, because we feel \u2013 Q1, we weren't sure, because we wanted to look a little bit more. We called it out as a potential issue and certainly we see a little bit of acceleration there in Q2 and if that acceleration continues then we're going to see that headwind. And the proactive SG&A is that we don't want to wait to react. We want to make sure that we get out in front of this with respect to investments and mitigate this on a go forward basis.", "Scott Levine", "Got it. And then maybe just one follow-up sticking with that SQ business. I know you guys used to give metrics for additions in Steri-Safe and also by a system like, just maybe qualitatively are you all still seeing the same success in general with penetration rates in some of the more, these older, call it, complementary services within the SQ and LQ businesses or that\u2019s slowing at all?", "Dan Ginnetti", "No, we continue to see nice adoption, whether it's our OSHA compliance program, we have really strong growth in our pharmaceutical waste program and SQ. On the LQ side, we continue to close our Sharps Management accounts as well Rx, our pharmaceutical waste compliance programs. So all of those we continue to see nice progress, so, no, I wouldn't say those are falling off.", "Scott Levine", "Got it. Great. Thank you.", "Charlie Alutto", "Thanks Scott.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason Rodgers from Great Lakes Review. Your line is open.", "Jason Rodgers", "The accounts being acquired by hospitals, the SQ accounts, do you consider them as SQ accounts or you know classifying them as LQ accounts?", "Dan Ginnetti", "Well, as Charlie mentioned, we call them blend accounts. So they are either SQ affiliated or blend accounts.", "Charlie Alutto", "But, yes, I think Jason, they are the SQ numbers, they've always been in the SQ numbers. We've always tracked them because we have been monitoring this for many years. And I think you've raised a good point. One is the LQ, what is a LQ now and what is a SQ? And given the fact that we've now gone to a revenue table with different services, it's likely when we give guidance, we will continue, \u2013 I know you guys all have models SQ, LQ and recall, we'll continue to give our numbers for that through the end of the year.", "It's most likely where we give guidance next year. When we talk about the lines of business services, the growth rates will be bucketed by that, because what do you call a hospital on SQ? So go into that location, you're still getting a small amount of waste. It is historically been in our SQ numbers, but it will probably be the end of the SQ, LQ matrix that we give out going into 2017.", "Jason Rodgers", "And as you cross-sell Shred-It, are you selling that as a bundled medical hazardous waste Shred-It contracts or are you keeping them separate?", "Brent Arnold", "I would say we're doing both, which depends on the customer and what they're looking for. So we can patch it together as an overall package of compliance services as well as removal of medical waste as well as their secure information destruction or we can sell them all parts.", "Jason Rodgers", "And to clarify, the M&I segment, does that include only industrial hazardous waste because I thought that area was down to around 3% of revenue?", "Charlie Alutto", "No. That again includes manufacturing and industrial. It is a worldwide number, the number that you're looking at. What it doesn't include is retail, healthcare and some SQ haz-waste.", "Jason Rodgers", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters.", "Brent Arnold", "Thank you, Sarah. I'd like to take a moment and share with listeners that Stericycle will celebrate its 20th anniversary of its initial public offering in August. 1996 was a record year for IPOs. More than 1,200 companies went public that year. 20 years later approximately 100 of those companies remain listed. Among all the 1996 IPOs, Stericycle is one of the top success stories. We are very proud of that accomplishment and we\u2019ll continue to build on our strength which include the hard work and dedication of our team members, they are one team, one goal mentality.", "Our operational excellence and continuous improvement focus, builds the ability to close an integrate acquisition, and not being afraid to try new things. I want to thank all of those team members, past and present that have contributed to our success these last 20 years, and we look forward to all the opportunities the next 20 years will bring. Thank you all and have a great evening.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

My name is Amanda, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Stericycle Third Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.", "Sean McMillan, Vice President of Corporate Finance, you may begin your conference.", "Sean McMillan", "Welcome to Stericycle's third quarter 2016 conference call. I will now read the Safe Harbor statement. This conference call may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, for example, general economic and market conditions. Our actual results could differ significantly from the results described in the forward-looking statements.", "Factors that could cause such differences include changes in governmental regulations of the collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of regulated waste or the proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information; increases in transportation and other operating costs; the level of governmental enforcement of regulations governing regulated waste collection and treatment or the proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information; our obligations to service our substantial indebtedness and to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our private placement notes, term loan credit facility and revolving credit facility; our ability to execute our acquisition strategy and to integrate acquired businesses; competition and demand for services in the regulated waste and secure information destruction industries; political, economic and currency risks related to our foreign operations; impairments of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangibles; variability in the demand for services we provide on a project or non-recurring basis; exposure to environmental liabilities, fluctuations in the price we receive for the sale of paper, disruptions in or attacks on our information technology systems; compliance with existing and future legal and regulatory requirements as well as other factors described in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "As a result, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results or trends. We make no commitment to disclose any subsequent revisions to forward-looking statements.", "I'll now turn it over to Charlie Alutto, CEO.", "Charlie Alutto", "Thank you, Sean. Good afternoon everybody. Thank you for joining us on today's call. We were able to maintain consistent margin performance in the quarter despite revenue headwinds from previously discussed pricing pressure and softness in the Manufacturing & Industrial market. Our EPS exceeded expectations, in part driven by the use of our record free cash flow to accelerate our stock repurchase of mandatory preferred convertible shares.", "Joining me on today's call to discuss our Q3 results and 2017 preliminary guidance will be Dan Ginnetti, CFO; and Brent Arnold, CRO. I'll now turn it over to Dan.", "Dan Ginnetti", "Thanks Charlie. The results for the third quarter are as follows. Global revenues were $890.1 million, up 23.9% from $718.6 million in Q3 2015. And internal growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and Manufacturing & Industrial services was up 1.6%. Domestic revenues were $664.1 million. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and Manufacturing & Industrial revenues, internal growth was 1.6%.", "For consistency of your models, we're providing the following for the remainder of the year. Domestic revenues were $664.1 million, of which $637.1 million was regulated waste and compliance services revenue, and $26.9 million was recall and returns. Domestic internal growth excluding recalls and returns revenues, was up 1% consisting of SQ up 1% and LQ flat. As anticipated, growth rates were impacted by SQ pricing pressure, lower hazardous waste volume from our industrial customers and lower fuel surcharges.", "International revenues were $226.1 million or 3% internal growth when adjusted for foreign exchange impact. As anticipated, international growth rates were impacted by the exiting of certain patient transportation contracts. Acquisitions contributed $184.7 million to growth in the quarter. Gross profits were $381 million or 42.8% of revenues.", "SG&A expense, excluding amortization, was $189.3 million or 21.3% of revenues. Adjusted income from operations or EBITDA was $191.7 million or 21.5% of revenues. Net interest expense was $24.7 million. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $61.5 million, or $0.72 per share, on an as reported basis, and $1.24 when adjusted for acquisition-related expenses and other adjustments.", "Now for the balance sheet. Our debt to EBITDA ratio was 3.35 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of the revolver at the end of the quarter was approximately $607 million. In the quarter, we repurchased 265,000 shares of the mandatory preferred convertible on the open market in the amount of $19.2 million. At the end of the quarter, we have authorization to purchase 3.1 million shares.", "Our CapEx was $33.8 million or 3.8% of revenues. Our DSO was 65 days. Year-to-date as-reported cash from operations was $417.8 million, and when adjusted for recall reimbursement and other items, cash from operations was $467.6 million.", "I'll now turn it over to Brent.", "Brent Arnold", "Thanks Dan. In the quarter, we closed five tuck-in acquisitions, all domestic. Revenues from the five acquisitions were approximately $0.4 million in the quarter and annualized for approximately $4 million.", "Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with well over $100 million annualized revenues in multiple geographies in lines of business. The SQ pricing pressure discussed previously continued in the quarter and will remain for the foreseeable future. To address these pressures, we are making incremental strategic investments and sales, marketing and data analytics. These investments will enable us to pinpoint and execute on opportunities to grow our business and improve our overall performance. Despite the SQ headwinds, we were able to maintain our operating margin profile as well as deliver positive revenue growth in other services. For example, in our hospital customer base, we successfully completed several large sharps management and pharmaceutical compliance installations.", "We saw strong growth in retail waste services driven by a high level of service and detail reporting capabilities. The combination of our customer relationships and our multiple compliance solutions provides a strong foundation for Q2 growth.", "In the secure information destruction service, we continued to see strong sales resulting from the conversion of unvended customers to ongoing service. In addition, the National Account team continues to make progress securing new large customers. Our synergies remain on track with recent progress in streamlining back-office processes and implementing new technology to optimize our inside sales and customer service.", "In closing, we would like to thank all of our worldwide team members for their continued commitment to our customers, our shareholders and our core values.", "I will now turn it over to Charlie.", "Charlie Alutto", "Thank you, Brent. I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2016 and preliminary guidance for 2017. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration and acquisition-related expenses and other adjusted items.", "As a reminder, our 2016 EPS guidance is adjusted for amortization expense. For 2016, we believe EPS will be in the range of $4.74 to $4.76. This includes the benefit of our ongoing strategy to repurchase the mandatory preferred convertible shares. We expect revenue for 2016 will be in the range of $3.56 billion to $3.58 billion depending on assumptions for growth and the impact of foreign exchange rates. Internal growth rates are expected to be: SQ, 3% to 5%; LQ, 2% to 3%; International, 4% to 5%; and recall and returns revenues between $95 million and $105 million.", "We have estimates for free cash flow in 2016 between $450 million and $470 million. 2016 CapEx is anticipated to be between $130 million to $135 million. We expect the 2016 full year as-reported tax rate to be approximately 36%.", "Now I'd like to provide preliminary guidance for 2017. For 2017, we believe EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.57 to $4.77 using a share count of approximately 91.1 million. This includes the unfavorable impact of approximately $0.19 from the normalization of performance compensation and additional SG&A investments to drive future growth and profitability. This is partially offset by approximately $0.17 of benefit from ongoing strategy to repurchase the mandatory preferred convertible shares.", "We believe revenues for 2017 will be in the range of $3.54 billion to $3.67 billion, depending on assumptions of foreign exchange and internal rates of flat to 3%. The worldwide revenue guidance for each of our service lines is as follows. Regulated waste and compliance services will be in the range of $2.03 billion to $2.09 billion. Secure information destruction services will be in the range of $780 million to $810 million. Communications and related services will be in the range of $340 million to $370 million depending on recall revenues. And Manufacturing & Industrial services will be in the range of $380 million to $400 million.", "We have estimates for free cash flow in 2017 between $450 million to $470 million. 2017 CapEx is anticipated to be between $125 million to $150 million. We expect the 2017 full-year as-reported tax rate to be approximately 36.5%.", "Stericycle continues to be the market leader in multiple services and geographies. We have a strong team and an unmatched infrastructure. We are confident in the long-term outlook of our business.", "As a reminder, Stericycle would be hosting its first Investor Day and webcast on the morning of Thursday, November 10 to share perspectives on Stericycle\u2019s strategies, capabilities and plans to drive long-term shareholder value. More details are posted on the event page of our Investor Relations website. We encourage investors, analysts and the public to join the live webcast or watch the meeting replay.", "Thank you for your time today. We'll now answer any questions. Amanda, you can open the Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels from William Blair. Your line is now open.", "Ryan Daniels", "Yes, good evening, and thank you for taking the question. Let me ask one on probably the hot button topic which is the SQ pricing. I'm curious if you can give us a little bit of color on how much you have incorporated into your 2017 guidance for that, and that's part A. And then part B, I'm assuming you have a pretty good view on that given your knowledge of contracts that are up for renewal, but can you confirm that\u2019s kind of how you're looking at what the pressure will be?", "Dan Ginnetti", "Yes, Ryan, as for 2017, that is - it's a very similar number that what we gave on the last call. We are anticipating plus or minus about $40 million in pricing headwinds in 2017.", "Charlie Alutto", "And Ryan, the second part of your question as far as to have a good view on that, we have long-term contracts that are spread out over three to five years. There is not any one year that we have larger contracts coming due. It is spread out pretty equally and that we are pretty confident in that range that Dan gave you.", "Ryan Daniels", "Okay. And given that we\u2019re now 11 months effectively through the year, I'm curious if you've seen any acceleration in that pricing pressure, or if that too has stabilized giving you better visibility as we look out over the next 12 months or so?", "Dan Ginnetti", "Yes. As you know, we first started seeing especially the hospital consolidation impact on our business earlier this year we spoke about on the last call. I will tell you that Q3 came in as expected, meaning that the pressure that we expected in Q3 came in line with our expectations.", "Ryan Daniels", "Okay. And then a final question, I\u2019ll hop off, also on pricing. Have you given any thought to maybe going back to your customers even prior to renewal? I would think that the renewal time, that's when they may be look at the market, look at websites, see who else is out there. So any thought about going back earlier and trying to re-extend contracts even if it brings some of that pricing pressure forward, or you're just going to let this play out over time? Thanks.", "Charlie Alutto", "No. Absolutely, Ryan, I think part of the investment we're making in SG&A both in resources and in the data analytics that Brent mentioned in his opening, certainly is a strategy that we want to be proactive in the renewals and that is part of our ongoing strategy. It\u2019s a little early to tell the impact but certainly that is part of the strategy. Thanks Ryan.", "Ryan Daniels", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Steinke from Barrington Research. Your line is open.", "Kevin Steinke", "Good afternoon. So following up on that question about being proactive on renewals, I think you\u2019ve also discussed, as part of your investment, looking to cross-sell more services to the SQ accounts that are seeing the pricing pressure and wondering if you're trying to make that more a part of your renewal discussions, and if you think that can have any offsetting impact on the pricing pressure you're experiencing?", "Brent Arnold", "Yes, Kevin. This is Brent. As we talked about on our last call, we were making a number of investments both marketing and sales to try to offset some of those headwinds that we are seeing. Part of it - you remembered correctly, right. We've got more sales reps that have been hired and we\u2019re working to have them have a bigger impact with regard to influencing that renewal, emphasizing the value of our Steri-Safe services and overall trying to approach that situation proactively. Obviously it's too early to see any returns on that but that is definitely one of our strategies as well as trying to grow new sites in SQ is another strategy to - while it won't offset that headwind, it will drive new growth that in turn will help us offset that in the long-term.", "So you're correct. Those are some of the things that we are doing. It\u2019s just a little too early right now to see if that's having an effect.", "Kevin Steinke", "Okay. And I think you also talked about on your last call about maybe digging more into the Manufacturing & Industrial business and analyzing it over the next several quarters about long-term fit, at least for parts of that business. So I'm just wondering if you\u2019ve started on that analysis and any initial thoughts on that work you're doing there.", "Charlie Alutto", "Sure, Kevin. We continue to evaluate multiple businesses, not just the M&I business for their long-term strategic fit in our portfolio of services. We have not made any definitive decision yet on M&I or any assets within Stericycle.", "Kevin Steinke", "Okay. Thanks for taking questions.", "Charlie Alutto", "Thanks Kevin.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line from Gary Bisbee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Gary Bisbee", "Hi guys. Good afternoon. I guess the first question I'd ask is on Shred-it and just diving into the guidance and how we think about profitability. Can you give us a sense what you're expecting for synergies and profit growth at Shred-it? Are we getting back to how you thought about the initial margin ramp at time of acquisition? I know that was pushed out, or should we think that that continues to be somewhat lower. And I guess I'm trying to understand is that a big factor that offsets pricing that you\u2019ve talked about in SQ, or how do we think about Shred-it? Thank you.", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes. Thanks Gary. I'll touch on a little bit of what we have as far as synergies built in and it will be what we shared all along. The $20 million in synergies that we deferred from 2016, we fully anticipate that we\u2019re going to be able to capture throughout 2017, which will certainly contribute to the profitability growth. And we've already begun enjoying from the in the last years since we've owned Shred-it. And so I think Brent could probably talk to you about the some of the steps that we are taking to achieve the numbers that we have in the guidance.", "Brent Arnold", "And these are - hi Gary, this is Brent. No new would activities here but just continue to focus on integration activities associated with the reroutes switching from onsite to offside, continuing to look at back-office processes. The team actually has had a really busy quarter this quarter as we look to automate and integrate all of our customer service. So we put them all on a national platform. We are in the process of doing that this quarter. We are doing the same thing with inside sales.", "We also have kicked off automation for several of our back-office processes around collections, cash applications, as well less AP. So a lot of those things will contribute to continue to drive cost out of the business to help us hit those synergies.", "Gary Bisbee", "And then I guess just a follow-up on your international business where the profitability has really struggled, can you give us an update on what's going on there and what the strategy is to improve it? I guess, are you exiting more U.K. contracts, any update on the cost situation of Brazil, whatever you think is a relevant update. Thank you.", "Charlie Alutto", "Sure, Gary. On the international, I mean, we've discussed this previously I think. What's driving some negative impact to the international margin certainly is the LatAm pricing pressures in our patient transports business. So let me address those separately.", "On the patient transport business, we continue to exit certain contracts. Once we do that, we\u2019ll evaluate the strategic value of this business. We anticipate exiting or contract ending in 2017, so the 2017 revenue for patient transport will be roughly $50 million to $60 million.", "And then on the LatAm, certainly we are facing inflation and pricing pressure on our large government contracts and we are looking at this on a contract-by-contract basis. If you just take our sequential to Q2 to Q3, we saw a modest increase on the EBITDA line. So we've made little progress but there is more work to be done. Right now the focus is on Latin America in the patient transport business.", "Gary Bisbee", "And then just one last one for me quotes both Charlie and Dan. I think you both highlighted the strong cash flow of the business. Can you give us a sense how you're thinking about reinvesting that cash flow going forward and is it different from how we\u2019ve thought about the last few years? I mean, if that's really the key asset and you're not forecasting much growth, how are you going to reinvesting in 27 to bring back growth longer term? Thank you.", "Dan Ginnetti", "Yes, we\u2019ve - definitely we\u2019re pleased with the record collection in the quarter and record free cash flow for the quarter. Gary, capital allocation strategy remains similar that it has in the past while we will shift buckets from quarter-to-quarter depending on the cash flow and the opportunity that exists. And that would remain to be acquisitions are a top priority of ours, certainly following our largest acquisition in company history and the debt level that we are going to be proactive as reducing debt when appropriate and certainly will remain opportunistic taking advantage of maybe a quarter where we are - we have maybe less acquisitions, we'll be opportunistic in purchasing the mandatory preferred convertible. And appropriate balance is necessary at this point in time while we both utilize the cash to grow the business as well as be able to pay down debt.", "Gary Bisbee", "Okay. Thank you.", "Charlie Alutto", "Thanks Gary.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.", "Al Kaschalk", "Good afternoon guys.", "Charlie Alutto", "Hey Al.", "Al Kaschalk", "I want to press a little bit on the SQ pricing in the context of you\u2019ve given us, I think two components, $30 million, $40 million and $16 million and it sounds like that's an approximate amount of headwind you\u2019re expecting in \u201817. But I think the struggle that a lot of us are having is trying to appreciate where you're at in that renewal process or new pricing market environment? Said differently, if you look at the SQ business, are you at a spot where the resets that you would expect on an new competitive environment were 40% or 50% of the way through, or do we have you a few more years to go through that?", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes, I'm going to have Dan answer your first, Al, because you're off onto \u201816 headwinds. It's not $30 million or $40 million in \u201816 and that's not we feel. So some of Dan level set that for you. I'll make a comment on where we are on the renewal process on that.", "Dan Ginnetti", "Al, on the last call, we expected $10 million to $15 million of pricing headwinds in the second half of the year. We are certainly within that range. I would anticipate maybe on the higher end of that range with expectation that you would see plus or minus $40 million in 2017.", "Charlie Alutto", "And as far as the contract renewals, obviously this is something that\u2019s come up this year, so this is something new facing us. So I think it certainly is something that will be with us through \u201817 and then we are making investments to be proactive - to the question we answered earlier, it's just too early to tell what kind of impact that will have. Obviously we don't want us to be something that will last three to five years which is our normal contract renewals of all of our agreements. So we are making those investments to shorten that time period and that time horizons. It\u2019s just a little bit too early to tell you at this point when we think this headwind goes away. Thanks Al.", "Al Kaschalk", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman from Stifel. Your line is open.", "Michael Hoffman", "Thanks, Charlie, Dan, Brent. So I'm going to come back to this SQ issue. So if I understand correctly, it's about $750 million is what\u2019s defined as SQ. Have you gotten a sense in your own mind how much of that $750 million before you offset with the new sales force cross-selling and then things of those initiatives, how big you think that total price compression is going to be?", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes, I don't think it's changed from what we talked about on the last call. We said that about - of that $700 million to $750 million of SQ revenue, about 18% to 20% of that is SQ that is hospital affiliated. So it's owned by hospital, affiliated with hospital. We are saying obviously more pricing pressure there up to 30%, 35% as they bid out multiple locations. So we are aggressive and trying to - we will not renew that. We want to keep that route density.", "And then we are seeing general price that we have national account as we\u2019ve talked about, Michael, on that $700 million to $750 million about roughly 25%, 30% are national accounts. There has been no change in that business. Obviously there is preferential pricing in there with contract Ts and Cs, so that really is not impacting. In fact, we\u2019re having a great renewal year on our national accounts.", "And then the remainder would be all of the SQs that are not affiliated with any large group or a hospital or a national account and we are seeing general pricing pressure we talked about at 10% to 15% on that business. So I think we've bucketed it really well, Michael.", "I think we understand that. And listen, that\u2019s why we are trying to get away from SQ, LQ, right, because we've got 20% of our SQ customers that are owned by LQ. So they are not truly SQ, because they are not independently making decisions. But I think we have a good handle on the SQ business and the different buckets.", "And then as to Brent\u2019s point, we'll use data analytics that help us get through how we should look at pricing. Maybe we don't have to discount as much as we\u2019re proactive. Maybe we throw in additional services and we can work through that but obviously we are going to make some investments to make smart decisions on that SQ business for us.", "Michael Hoffman", "Yes. I just want to make sure I heard the numbers correct. So out of $750 million, approximately 20% is owned by LQ, 25% is national, all the rest is the rest of SQ that has some pricing pressures. So the 20% that\u2019s LQ has got 30%, 35%, national none, and all the rest is 10% to 15%?", "Charlie Alutto", "That\u2019s correct.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. So that's about $110 million. Is that the right - $110 million, $120 million, that\u2019s sort of what we're looking at?", "Charlie Alutto", "You\u2019re talking about from a discounting perspective?", "Michael Hoffman", "Just if - okay. And at this juncture, this 10 to 15 second half, do I annualize that and that's 20 to 30 for this year, 40 next year. So let's take the 30, I've got 70 done, so I got 50 left.", "Dan Ginnetti", "Yes, Mike, I think we anticipate a bit of an acceleration which is why our guidance is really plus or minus 40. I think you're going to hit the inflection point where you're going to begin to see it wind down as you ramp up. That's really what we are looking at as to see the signals as to when we are seeing this and reduced amounts, in other words beyond majority of it. But I think it's safe to say that we expect a full impact in 2017 that's why we put approximately plus or minus 40.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. Thanks for that statement, Dan. But my question was, one, do I annualize the second half and you had 30 was the full-year \u201816 effect? 40 is approximately \u201817, so that\u2019s 70. If I'm dealing with $110 million to $120 million, I've got to 40 to 50 left.", "Dan Ginnetti", "That is correct. You could look at it that way, so we could tell you that we got another year at \u201817 if we are not successful in mitigating the pricing impact.", "Michael Hoffman", "So what gives you confidence you\u2019ve bucketed that right?", "Dan Ginnetti", "Well, certainly we have data that we know - the only thing I would tell you, Michael - and first of all we know what the national accounts are and we've had a long track record and history there, so we are confident on the national account. And the reason we bucket the hospital on 18% to 20% is that not every SQ that's acquired is of notice that they are now owned by a hospital system. So could that be 20% to 22%? We are pretty confident in the number. Could it go up a little bit over the next year or two? Certainly it can, but I think we have done a good job of identifying the customers in our database. We track hospital affiliates ever science the early 2000s. We've never seen it behave differently but we track it. So I'm confident that we've bucketed it correctly.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. Fair enough. In your - I\u2019m going to take the midpoint of your 2017, so that's $467 million. In your $467 million, what's your assumption for tons of paper sold at what price?", "Dan Ginnetti", "The tons of paper is really\u2026", "Charlie Alutto", "700,000 to 800,000 tons at the current rate, which is $157 per ton.", "Dan Ginnetti", "That's correct.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. And I mean you're not concerned that in December of last year we were at $125?", "Dan Ginnetti", "Well, Michael I think we are always going to be concerned about that and that's why you're noticing that in the range that we gave, you have a much broader range than we had given historically. Last year we gave guidance it was $0.07 EPS range. This year we gave $0.10 to the downside, $0.10 to the upside, realize those moving parts in the business. One of those could be paper and so the downside of that would assume that we aren\u2019t able to hold at that level the entire year. The upside would be, if you would, read the index sometime it moves and stays above the 10-year average for a short period of time and so we have marketed or ranged our guidance in order to be able to account for those things.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. And then when we look at the synergies that you paid for when you bought Shred-it, there was approximately $52 million left out of the original ones at Shred-it and Cintas had identified. That's the number that's been moving around. How much of that $52 million have you captured in - will capture in \u201816 at this point and then what's left?", "Dan Ginnetti", "Yes, I think we have $31 million we\u2019ve capture exiting the 2016. There are about $20 million more that we would achieve in 2017, and then we are still considering and working on synergies that would be between Shred-it and Stericycle.", "Michael Hoffman", "Right, but those weren\u2019t the ones that you paid for and...", "Dan Ginnetti", "That\u2019s correct.", "Michael Hoffman", "Right, so those are the - you got trucks in a market, can I go to one truck, that type thing.", "Dan Ginnetti", "Right, that\u2019s the $20 million remaining in 2017.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. And then can you share with us - you talked about this before and my recollection to the first half of the year, is you actually in a good way had a pleasant surprise about the organic growth going on at document destruction. The sales force did a good job of converting unvended. So can you frame what that organic growth looked like in the third quarter combination of that price plus how much did they get converted?", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes, Brent will take that one.", "Brent Arnold", "Yes, I would say Michael that's close to 4%. We continue to see great results with regard to converting the end-to-end market. We\u2019re also having a lot of success with our national accounts and winning new business, but overall 4% is what we projected.", "Michael Hoffman", "That was in the third quarter?", "Brent Arnold", "Correct.", "Michael Hoffman", "Right. And is that all volume or was there price in that, or is it that\u2019s all conversion of unvended?", "Brent Arnold", "The majority of that is - I would say the majority of that is conversion and a little bit of it being price.", "Charlie Alutto", "Thanks Michael.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sean Dodge from Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Sean Dodge", "Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. Going back to gross margins for a moment. Third quarter was flat sequentially despite the pricing pressures. I know Brent said it was still early as far as the benefits from some of the new sales investments. Can you talk about what did help you offset those drags in the quarter?", "Brent Arnold", "Yes, absolutely. I will just take you through the quarter-to-quarter gross margin bridge. Q2 was 42.8. We had the anticipated pricing pressures in the SQ business as well as a temporary impact from exit of a patient transportation contract. Those combined were about 54 basis points of headwinds. However we were favorably and directly offset by improvements in gross margins from foreign exchange, increased paper prices and we saw higher recall revenues, those combined were about 35 basis points. And by improvements in all other lines of revenues, it provided an additional 19 basis points of gross margins. So the puts and takes directly offset each other in the quarter.", "Sean Dodge", "Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then the acquisitions during the quarter were really light. I know you guys said you're taking some time to integrate and kind of retrench internationally. How long does this pause last, and is this kind of the level of small tuck-in M&A we should expect for the next few quarters or more or less?", "Charlie Alutto", "Well, we did five deals Sean this last month. This last quarter we did 10. I wouldn't read anything into the number of deals or the annual revenue from this quarter. It's simply timing of deals. We've got a significant pipeline, especially in the secure information pipeline. And as you know, Cintas and Shred-it were both doing acquisitions, but after they joined forces, they slowed down. So we think there is a great pipeline there. This is just a timing in Q3. I wouldn't read anything into the five deals. I think a normal quarter for us is more like what's happened in Q2.", "Sean Dodge", "Got it. All right, thank you.", "Charlie Alutto", "Thanks Sean.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Thanks. Good evening.", "Charlie Alutto", "Hi Scott.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Hi. Could we start out on communications solutions related services? There is a big deceleration in organic year-to-date second quarter to third quarter, and I saw that your recall which is in that went higher presumably on one of those large smartphone makers. So if you could update on what the deceleration was, and if you are in fact seeing better in recall? And then the final part of this question is what is implicit in the recall guide for next year in comm solutions? Thanks.", "Charlie Alutto", "Sure, I\u2019ll take that. You have a couple of questions in there. You\u2019re right we had a solid quarter for recalls. It was $26.9 million, but it actually declined year-over-year, Scott, by about 11.2%. That's just the U.S. number. So when you look at the communication and related services decline sequentially year-over-year, it's mostly to do with worldwide recalls were actually lower this Q3 than they were last Q3.", "As far as we did raise guidance though for 2016. We raised it to $95 million to $105 million, that simply because we saw a lot of activity towards the end of the quarter and it\u2019s continued into Q4, so we thought it was best to raise guidance for 2016.", "Related to your question about guidance for 2017 in that communication-related service line of $340 million to $370 million, that has roughly $90 million to $120 million in recall and revenue by guidance in that number.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Thanks. And so the big driver of the slowdown of organic year-to-date was the year-over-year of recall, or was there something else?", "Dan Ginnetti", "No, the big driver was year-over-year decline in recall, that\u2019s right.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Got it. Thanks. And then switching gears, in the 2017 guidance, you mentioned $0.19 of - and I didn't get it down well in my notes, but it seemed like some sort of investment spending which sounded bigger than what you would have told us last quarter offset by about $0.17 of purchasing the converted preferred. So could you elaborate on, one, what those investments were a little more specifically, and then just a little color around the repurchase maybe in the third quarter of the convert preferred and what the $0.17 represents next year? Thanks.", "Dan Ginnetti", "Yes, thank you. So just to be clear, we didn\u2019t - none of this was found last quarter on the call. This is all new guidance for 2017. And what we did talk about on the $0.19, it\u2019s all what we call corporate expenses and that's a made up of really two buckets. It's performance compensation which is roughly about half of that, and this is primarily related to cash flow and it\u2019s just tied to specific performance goals. This performance compensation was only partially accrued for in 2016 results. And as our practice has been to accrue appropriate levels throughout the year based on real-time performance. As this is our initial guidance in 2017, we historically included a full performance compensation in our guidance to reflect our expectation of not only achieving but exceeding our goals.", "The other half of that spend is really in SG&A investments for growth. And these would be in things such as IT to enhance our operational and financial systems, as well as continued investments to support growth. Throughout the course of the year, we'll evaluate these projects and we'll adjust and release these funds where best appropriate.", "I think your other question, Scott, was really about the $0.17 of purchasing the mandatory preferred convertible. What we've looked at in why we are purchasing that over the common is really it\u2019s the best use of cash. That only gives us the best ability to reduce dilution by being able to buy more shares but it also offsets 5.25% dividend rather than paying down 2% interest. We were very successful in doing that in Q3. Again you would see that we purchased about $0.07 of that. And so we really built that into our guidance going into next year and even into Q4, we\u2019ll do a marginal amount.", "We've said conservative guidance for next years. Doesn\u2019t really has to be a balance of how we are going to utilize all of our cash flow.", "Scott Schneeberger", "All right, thanks. And just add to clarify - sorry to start it [ph], it\u2019s $0.07 year-to-date or $0.07 in the third quarter of this year?", "Dan Ginnetti", "It will be $0.08 year-to-date. We did purchase a penny of it in Q2. We did $0.07 in Q3 and our guidance really for next quarter would be anywhere from $0.02 to $0.03, and we could be opportunistic depending on again have the quarter shaped up from all avenues of our capital allocation strategy.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Thanks. And to clarify what I meant when I originally asked the question was that I thought that this - you would announce on the second quarter call some SG&A investments, and I don't recall what that amount is but it sounds like half of the $0.19, so let's it called $0.09 or $0.10 is next year?", "Dan Ginnetti", "This is SG&A investment over and above what we communicate to you in Q2. This would be additional investment for 2017.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Great. Thanks for the clarification.", "Charlie Alutto", "Thanks Scott.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Manthey from Baird. Your line is open.", "David Manthey", "Thank you. Good afternoon. Historically you\u2019ve indicated that more than half of your organic growth comes from cross-selling services. Could you outline your expectations for volume, price and cross-selling that gets you to that 0% to 3% next year?", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes, I think if you look at, David, now given the pricing pressure that we face especially in our SQ business, looking out in the historical context of SQ, LQ, we would estimate that about 20% of our growth will come from price and volume and about 80% from additional services. And really we have seen no change on the LQ side of the business. So roughly 10% to 20% price and volume and the rest of the growth from additional services. So you see that it has changed a little bit on the SQ profile, given the pricing pressure.", "David Manthey", "So the delta between your historical overall organic growth is 7% to 8% and this 0% to 3% is entirely price?", "Charlie Alutto", "No. I can take you through each service line but if you look at going forward into next year, if you look at it purely from a revenue standpoint, as Dan said, we are down about $40 million in price concessions and it doesn't offset the growth of the business. There is other things we are doing with synergies and other opportunities, but we basically - I think it's $40 million in price that goes right to the bottom line, about $100 million to $110 million in the revenue but that has to flow-through, so flow-through obviously I think - Dan, what is the EBITDA flow-through amounts in...", "Dan Ginnetti", "Yes, I think it would be the mid-to-high 20s.", "Charlie Alutto", "So it's about $25 million to $30 million, plus that we are certainly getting revenue from that. And then you have the impact of M&I year-over-year being flat and then obviously exiting the PTS [ph] contracts which creates additional headwinds for the total business.", "David Manthey", "Okay. And then you had other income of about $3 million when that's normally an expense. Could you outline what that was?", "Dan Ginnetti", "Yes, that was settling of an inter-company loan dealing with two different exchange rates. This was between the Sterling and Netherlands, and obviously with the Brexit that's affected how that came out of the financial.", "David Manthey", "Okay. And then finally as you're looking at ways to target new customers and invest in getting renewals and things of that nature, are you willing to take new business or get renewals at a lower revenue and margin than you have historically to sort of recharge the growth from here forward?", "Brent Arnold", "David, this is Brent. I would say absolutely. Obviously we look at all new business carefully but given our infrastructure, our footprint, we often times can bring on new business lower than other people given we have the biggest infrastructure and route density everywhere. So yes, we are not walking away for any new opportunities, plus we have the ability to up-sell once we get it, which increases the profitability. So no, I would say we are very aggressive at going after new business and new sites.", "David Manthey", "Okay. Thank you.", "Charlie Alutto", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Barbara Noverini from Morningstar. Your line is open.", "Barbara Noverini", "That\u2019s Barb Noverini. Good afternoon everybody.", "Charlie Alutto", "Hello Barb.", "Barbara Noverini", "So internal LQ growth came in flat year-over-year, which is also much lower than typical. Can you comment on what you've been seeing on the LQ side, and what gives you confidence that pricing pressure going to accelerate in that customer category as well?", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes, so a good question on the LQ. I mean, the LQ really, Barb, has been driven on the M&I. A lot of the M&I work, remember again - take a step back. SQ and LQ is not just our medical waste services, it describes our total business in the U.S. So when you see the decline in M&I like we faced, most of that M&I work is flowing into the LQ bucket. So when you look at LQ where it was just less than 1% last quarter and flat to down a little bit this quarter, they are the ones taking the brunt of the M&I hit. As far as pricing pressure in the LQ side of the business, we are doing great on the LQ side of the business.", "To be honest with you, we just look at just our medical waste services. Brent touched on it early on and we had really large installations in both sharps and pharmaceutical waste installations, some really large healthcare centers. The team is doing a really good job there. We've hit the ground running with respect to secure information disposals. So certainly it's always been a category with respect to price, that's why the margin has always been lower than our SQ business. I don't see any changes there. I think it will always be price-sensitive, but we've done a really, really good job on our traditional hospital LQ business.", "Barbara Noverini", "Got it. That's actually a helpful distinction. So if you were - I know you are trying to walk us away from that categorization but if you were to disaggregate that M&I impact, would you say that LQ hospital category performed as typical in that sort of low-to-mid single-digit organic growth range that you\u2019ve had in the past?", "Charlie Alutto", "It did. It was roughly 4% or 3% to 5%.", "Barbara Noverini", "Okay.", "Charlie Alutto", "And we usually get a benefit of other things coming in on LQ that always would make it 5% to 8% but certainly that wasn't there because the headwinds in M&I.", "Barbara Noverini", "Got it. And then you mentioned that retail haz was doing quite well in the quarter. So if you were to sort of give us a ballpark estimate on what that growth rate is, what could we expect from that?", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes, it's been in the high-single digits and that's where it\u2019s year-to-date.", "Barbara Noverini", "Okay, great. Thanks very much.", "Charlie Alutto", "Thanks Barb.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.", "Hamzah Mazari", "Good afternoon. Thank you. Just had a question on trying to understand the 10% to 15% price declines in half of the SQ customer base. Is it just systematic that the hospital affiliated accounts understand price decline is there, but how is it spreading to the SQ - the rest of the SQ customer base? Is that just your estimate, is it a bottoms-up analysis, or is the business incrementally more competitive? Just trying to understand that piece.", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes, I think, Hamzah, it's always been a competitive market, the SQ local markets. So I don't think there has been any change with that. I think the one thing that's changed and you see it in the press, you see it all over that healthcare is based with reimbursement costs, so they are getting less fees for their service and now for the first time I think they are looking at anywhere they can save even a little money, so for our contract I think fell below the radar. We were getting more attention there and that's why we are seeing discounting in that marketplace. I think it\u2019s - the competition though I would tell you - from market-by-market I would tell you hasn't changed much in the last couple of years.", "Hamzah Mazari", "Got it. And then just a follow-up for Dan. The op margin - trying to understand the op margin guidance at the midpoint. Are you guiding flat op margins for \u201817 at the EPS midpoint? Is that the right way to think about sort of operating margins? Just trying to - the reason I asked is I'm trying to understand what the offsets on the margin side are to the $40 million pricing pressure you're going to see next year?", "Dan Ginnetti", "Yes, I think if were thinking about operating margins for 2017, I would be in the mid-21 range, so it is really flat to this year. Certainly there are a number of puts and takes, and I think Charlie, Brent and myself, we have seen some of them. Certainly you have the synergies that will be only partially offsetting the price concessions we\u2019ll have next year. And then the growth it doesn't come through at the same percent that pricing goes out.", "So you're going to see a little bit of pricing there on profitability headwinds. We are also going to be experiencing some effects exiting a patient contract that can temporarily affect margins until you're fully out of that. And then we are going to make investments in the business, and that\u2019s important that we do that with the things that Charlie, Brent talked about and in those investment we know will build return over the long-term.", "But initially at the beginning of the year, those investments will be really investments to set out the infrastructure in that stage to be able to grow the business, so that's going to be some of the headwinds.", "Hamzah Mazari", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Charlie Alutto", "Thanks, Hamzah.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Joel Kaufman", "Thanks. It\u2019s actually Joel in for Isaac. Maybe back to the consolidations team from a slightly different angle. Can you talk about how you're thinking about the potential for increased efficiencies maybe on the route density side just given your consolidating customer base?", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes, Joel. So I think certainly route density, as Brent mentioned it before, we want to be able to be the low cost provider, low expense provider in the marketplace. So we've utilized on our better technology over the last few years. The team continues to make strides in that area. The focus now really is on the secure information destruction side of the business to get that same level of service, a high level of service, with the best route density that you can get. And that's one of the reasons I think the strategy - and Brent answered before would be, would we be willing to renew customers at a lower rate? Yes, because we don't want to lose that competitive advantage that we have in the marketplace which is route density. So it does play into it certainly. hopefully that answered your question?", "Brent Arnold", "But Joel, this is Brent. Just one of things to think about, a lot of times when these SQs are being rolled up into an integrated delivery network, there is often times don't even change, right. There just the name or the sign on the building changes, so not all the time is that provide us kind of a more centralized spot to pick it up. We often times are still covering the same footprint things that we look for.", "Joel Kaufman", "Great, thanks. And then maybe over to haz. Can you all parse out the margin profile of the energy, sort of project-based work versus the general M&I? Just trying to understand the impact of profitability if we happen to see a resurgence in demand in either of those markets.", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes, we still haven't broken out M&I and its own kind of service line and profitability at this point, Joel. But if you think about environmental solutions in general, the general - the gross margins are in the mid-to-low 20s and the EBITDA margins are in the high single digits. Certainly that includes the whole portfolio, so that\u2019s healthcare haz, retail haz and M&I. M&I does have a lower profitability - M&I and project is a lower probability than retail and healthcare haz would have.", "Joel Kaufman", "Great. Thanks.", "Charlie Alutto", "Thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Jason Rodgers from Great Lakes Review. Your line is open.", "Jason Rodgers", "Just a question on the SQ contracts, the one subject to the 10% to 15% pricing pressure. As those come up for renewal, are you renewing those at a consistent rates as you have historically, or is the margin on some of that business so low that you had to walk away from it?", "Charlie Alutto", "We take every contract when we look at discounting, Jason, on a case-by-case contract-by-contract basis. So it's hard to just generalize what we are doing on discounting. It's really done on a case-by-case contract-by-contract basis.", "Dan Ginnetti", "And the 10% to 15% is really just an average of the aggregate, right, so that\u2019s something more than that or less something go up.", "Jason Rodgers", "All right. And I'm sorry if I missed it, but the internal growth estimate for \u201817. Did you break that out between SQ, LQ and international?", "Charlie Alutto", "We did not. We are not going to be giving SQ, LQ. We broke it out by service line. Regulated waste and compliance will be $2.04 billion to $2.09 billion. Communication and related services will be $340 million to $370 million. The M&I will be between $380 million to $400 million, and secure information and destruction will be between $780 million to $810 million. Total it's flat to up 3%. And then the mix of international domestic is similar to what it has been over the last year-to-date breakup.", "Jason Rodgers", "And is there any savings from the McKinsey baked into your 2017 outlook?", "Dan Ginnetti", "Well, most of that was built into the results for this year and any remainder is built into this current guidance.", "Jason Rodgers", "Then finally just speaking of Steri-Safe, rolling that out internationally the clinical services, wonder if you could talk about the status of that and any potential new growth areas?", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes, we continue to look at it market-by-market. We've had success recently in Western Europe, Spain and Portugal as we've coupled it with a symmetry service. It really takes a different form in each country. In the U.K. we've coupled it with First Practice Management, which is an website for HR and compliance for small practices. I would say the focus over the next 12 to 18 months is as we look at Latin America and the opportunity to roll out in equivalence to Euromed [ph] in all Latin America markets.", "Jason Rodgers", "Thank you.", "Charlie Alutto", "Thank you.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to the presenters.", "Charlie Alutto", "Thanks Amanda. Thank you for taking time to listen to our call this evening. Since we are based in the Chicago, I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention the Cubs. This weekend will be the first World Series games in 71 years played at Wrigley Field. I say this with no disrespect to our team members in Cleveland, but go Cubs.", "We look forward to seeing everyone on the November 10 Investor Day in New York City. Have a great night everybody.

My name is Devon, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Stericycle Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.", "Sean McMillan, Vice President of Corporate Finance, you may begin your conference.", "Sean McMillan - Stericycle, Inc.", "Welcome to Stericycle's Fourth Quarter 2016 Conference Call. I will now read the Safe Harbor statement. This conference call may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, for example, general economic and market conditions. Our actual results could differ significantly from the results described in the forward-looking statements.", "Factors that could cause such differences include changes in or level of enforcement of governmental regulation of the collection, transportation, treatment, and disposal of regulated waste or the proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information; compliance with existing and future legal and regulatory requirements; increases in transportation and other operating costs; our obligation to service our substantial indebtedness and to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our private placement notes, term loan credit facility, and revolving credit facility; our ability to execute our acquisition strategy and to integrate acquired businesses; competition and demand for services in the regulated waste and secure information destruction industries; political, economic, and currency risks related to our foreign operations; impairments of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangibles; variability in the demand for services we provide on a project or non-recurring basis; exposure to environmental liabilities; fluctuations in the price we receive for the sale of paper; disruptions in or attacks on our information technology systems; as well as other factors described in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "As a result, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results or trends. We make no commitments to disclose any subsequent revisions to forward-looking statements.", "I will now turn it over to Charlie Alutto, CEO.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thank you, Sean. Hello, everybody. Thank you for joining us on today's call. Overall, we were very pleased with our fourth quarter operational performance. Additionally, our recall team delivered a record breaking quarter, which enhanced our results. We continue to make great strides in the integration of the Secure Information Destruction business and related acquisitions.", "Finally, we completed our initial evaluation of certain assets for potential divestiture. We have sold one hazardous waste asset in the UK and we have designated our patient transport business and an additional hazardous waste business in the UK as assets held for sale. Joining me on today's call will be Dan Ginnetti, CFO; and Brent Arnold, COO.", "I'll now turn it over to Dan.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thank you, Charlie. Before I give the numbers, I would like to highlight a change to our reportable and operating segments. In our Q4 press release and going forward, our financial results for Canada will be included along with our domestic business. Our new reportable segments are; Domestic and Canada, Regulated Waste and Compliance Services and International Regulated Waste and Compliance Services. Our new operating segments are Domestic and Canada Regulated Waste and Compliance Services, Domestic, Communication and Related Services and International Regulated Waste and Compliance Services.", "These changes will not impact the four service lines reported on the revenue table in the press release. And going forward, we will continue to provide that revenue table.", "As you're aware, on January 26, we issued an 8-K, that included adjustments to both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings. When providing the Q4 2016 numbers, I will provide results both including and excluding the items from the 8-K that affected revenues and expenses.", "The results for the fourth quarter are as follows. Global revenues were $906.4 million, up 2% from $888.3 million in Q4 2015. And internal growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions, divestitures and manufacturing industrial services was up 5.2%. Domestic and Canada revenues were $725.3 million, and excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange, internal growth was 4.4%.", "For consistency of your 2016 models, we're providing the following information. Please note that for 2017 results, we will no longer provide this breakout. Domestic only revenues were $686.6 million, of which $633.6 million was Regulated Waste and Compliance Services revenue, and $53 million was recall.", "Domestic internal growth, excluding recall revenues and adjusted for 8-K items was SQ, up 1% and LQ, up 1%. As anticipated, growth rates were impacted by SG pricing pressure, and lower hazardous waste volume from our industrial customers. International revenues, including Canada, were $219.8 million or 6% internal growth when adjusted for foreign exchange impact, acquisitions, divestitures and 8-K items.", "And as anticipated, international growth rates were impacted by exiting of certain patient transportation contracts. Acquisitions contributed $5 million to growth in the quarter and divestitures unfavorably impacted revenues by $0.2 million.", "Gross profit was $380.2 million, or 42% of revenues. When adjusted for 8-K items, gross profit was $388.8 million, or 42.6%. SG&A excluding amortization was $211.5 million, or 23.3% of revenues, and when adjusted for the 8-K items, SG&A was $188.5 million, or 20.7% of revenue.", "Adjusted income from operations or EBITDA was $168.7 million, or 18.6% of revenues and when adjusted for the 8-K items, EBITDA was $200.3 million, or 22%. Net interest expense was $24.6 million. The as reported tax rate for the quarter was 56.1%. When adjusted for the 8-K and other adjusting items, the tax rate was 37%.", "Net income attributable to Stericycle was $12.3 million or $0.14 per share on an as reported basis and $1 when adjusted for acquisitions-related expenses and other adjustments. When taking into account the impact of the 8-K of $0.23, the adjusted EPS would have been $1.23 for the quarter.", "Now for the balance sheet. Our covenant debt to EBITDA ratio was 3.42 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of the revolver at the end of the quarter was approximately $655 million.", "In the quarter, we repurchased 105,000 shares of mandatory preferred convertible on the open market in the amount of $6.6 million. At the end of the quarter, we have authorization to purchase 3.1 million shares.", "Our CapEx was $35.2 million or 3.9% of revenues. Our DSO was 64 days. Year-to-date, as reported cash from operations was $547.4 million and when adjusted for recall reimbursement and other items, cash from operations was $612.4 million.", "I will now turn it over to Brent.", "Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thanks, Dan. This quarter we closed nine tuck-in acquisitions. The nine acquisitions were five domestic and four international with total revenues in the quarter of approximately $1.1 million and annualized of approximately $12.4 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with well over $100 million annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business.", "This quarter we also divested a UK-based hazardous waste asset that unfavorably impacted revenues in the quarter by approximately $0.2 million, and has an annualized impact of $3 million. In the quarter, we saw strong performance from our recall team, progress on our Shred-it integration and continued implementation of our SQ strategic investments. Focusing on the recall team, the combination of our call center expertise, reverse logistics capabilities and the dedication of our team produced a record-breaking performance in the fourth quarter.", "While some of the success was driven by the team's ability to quickly scale up to handle multiple consumer electronic events, we also saw continued success in the automotive and medical verticals. This commitment to our customers demonstrates why we are the market leader and why global brands trust Stericycle for executing a product recall. Our Shred-it synergies remain on track with a number of key projects making significant strides over the past several months.", "This quarter, we completed the integration of our inside sales and customer service teams. By investing in call center automation and intelligent work distribution systems, inbound calls and service requests can now be handled consistently across all our U.S. branches. On the field operation side, the team has established standard best practices, and we plan to have these rolled out by the end of Q1. By leveraging standard procedures, our team members consistently meet the needs of the customer, while enabling ongoing incremental improvements to the process.", "And finally, our cross-selling efforts produced several sizeable wins in both our national and hospital accounts base. In our SQ business, we continue to see competitive pricing pressure. While in the quarter, the team made good progress implementing the strategic initiatives discussed at our Investor Day. These initiatives will take time, and we will continue to provide updates on future calls.", "In closing, I would like to thank all of our worldwide team members for their continued commitment to our customers, our shareholders, and our core values. I will now turn it over to Charlie.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thanks, Brent. I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2017. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements, and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration and acquisition-related expenses, and other adjusted items.", "For 2017, we believe EPS estimates will be in the range of $4.54 to $4.74, using a share count of approximately 91 million. This includes an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, partially offset by acquisitions completed in the quarter. We believe the revenues for 2017 will be in the range of $3.51 billion to $3.64 billion, depending on assumptions of foreign exchange and internal growth rates.", "The worldwide revenue guidance for each of our service lines is as follows. Regulated Waste and Compliance Services will be in the range of $2.01 billion to $2.06 billion. Secure Information Destruction Services will be in the range of $785 million to $815 million.", "Communication and Related Services will be in the range of $340 million to $370 million, depending on recall revenues. Manufacturing and Industrial Services will be in the range of $375 million to $395 million. This includes the full year impact of the UK divested M&I asset. We have estimates for free cash flow in 2017 between $450 million to $470 million.", "2017 CapEx is anticipated to be between $125 million to $150 million. We expect the 2017 full year as reported tax rate to be approximately 36.5%. We are very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, and we're confident in the long-term outlook for our business.", "Thank you for your time today. We'll now answer any questions. Devon, you can open the queue.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of a participant whose information was unable to be gathered. Please state your first and last name and company. Your line is open.", "Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Hey, guys, can you hear me?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "We can hear you. Is this Ryan?", "Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Yeah. It's Ryan Daniels from William Blair. I apologize for that. I did put my info in. Thanks for the color thus far. I wanted to ask one on the guidance for 2017. I appreciate that it excludes the hazardous waste asset that you already sold, but does your current revenue and cash EPS guidance include the assets held for sale? And then if it does, if those are sold, can you talk about the potential impact to sales and EPS when that occurs?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah, Ryan. The guidance for both revenue and EPS excludes the asset that was sold. The revenue and EPS associated with the assets held for sale are still in the numbers. Should those ultimately come to sale at some point during the year, we would make an adjustment at that point. When we do, you should expect that it's more of a revenue adjustment and would have minimal, if any, impact to EPS for the year.", "Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you for that. And then, Charlie, you mentioned, it sounds like you completed the initial analysis on some of the non-core operations. I don't know if that's just internationally, which led to these decisions, but I'm curious if you've completed it domestically as well and decided to maintain the full M&I assets et cetera in the domestic operations?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Sure, Ryan. As I said in the opening statements, we did make the determination on what assets were sold and, what are our determinant held for sale in the UK. We did, however, also make a decision on the U.S. business. We've decided to keep our M&I hazardous waste assets in the U.S. at this point.", "Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then final one, I'll get out of the queue. Just any more color on the pricing pressure, I'm curious if it's accelerated, decelerated, stayed the same, just any color there would be helpful. Thanks.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. We continue to experience pricing pressure, obviously, from local and regional competitors. Basically Q4 came in as expected, so there is no change to the assumptions that we made on SQ pricing as we discussed on our Investor Day.", "Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. Perfect. Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Sean Dodge with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC", "Yeah, thanks. Brent, I think, you said the sales force reorganization has now been completed, it doesn't seem like much of a stretch to imagine that that process weighed on sales productivity during the course of it. Do you think that's the case that organic growth was negatively impacted by the reorganization last couple of quarters? And if so, could you put some bookends around how big you think the impact might have been?", "Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc.", "Well, overall, Sean, we've got a number of sales forces, and so, I don't know overall the results were affected. We've had actually quite a bit of success with cross-selling. We've been successful at selling \u2013 cross-selling at both hospitals, large retailers, pharma. As a matter of fact just this quarter we have a really large retailer that was using our hazardous waste service, who now is going to use us for Secure Information Destruction. So I would tell you, from that perspective, things have gone well. But with the customer service as well as the inside sales integrations that were happening in Q4, we did notice a little bit of lost purged volume, but the good news is we're back on track and we're seeing that, we're expecting now.", "Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Thanks. And then, Charlie, the decision to keep the U.S. M&I business, can you give us a little bit more maybe background on what went into that decision. Are you seeing something changing in the market that makes you a little bit more encouraged now than perhaps you would have been before?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Sure, Sean. We looked that as a few things that played \u2013 a few factors that played in our decision, I mean, certainly, we didn't feel we'd get maximum value for the sale of this business at this time. The business has stabilized, and I think you see that in the table on the M&I line, so we feel that that business has stabilized. And there are improvements that we think we can make to the business, and we think, we feel that the U.S. industrial market does have a potential for a rebound especially in the United States, also we looked at these operational assets, they fit really well and support our growing retail, our healthcare haz and our Rx waste services. So in the end, we believe that this is a great, this business is \u2013 it has great potential for Stericycle, so we've decided not to sell that asset.", "Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC", "Got it. Thanks again and congratulations on the quarter.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thanks, Sean.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Kevin Steinke with Barrington Research. Your line is open.", "Kevin Mark Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Good afternoon. So you talked about some success in cross-selling Secure Information Destruction, and actually you bumped up your revenue guidance for that business line by, I think, $5 million for 2017. So can you just talk about what's going well there. I mean I think you talked a couple of quarters ago about you're still working on some sales pilots there. Have you gotten to the point where you actually are starting to roll out some of those sales pilots more aggressively, or what's contributed to that performance, and the outlook for 2017 in Secure Information Destruction?", "Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc.", "Hey, Kevin, this is Brent. I'll take that one. We've already mentioned cross-selling is going very well. We've had a number of pilots also kind of go into full implementation both on the SQ side or telesales side, and also in our hospital sales groups. We now have a dedicated team of specialists selling it into our hospital customers. And as you know, we've had a lot of success selling additional services to our hospital customers. I would tell you that the biggest success though really has come from the team's ability to convert the unbin (20:54) market. We've often mentioned the unbin (20:57) market is as big as $2.5 billion in opportunity, and the sales executives associated with Shred-it have had a great deal of success closing that business, and as we continue to improve our service and grow that business again we feel optimistic about the growth potentials for our Secure Information business.", "Kevin Mark Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Great. And then, I think at the Investor Day you talked about within your communication solutions looking to roll out, I think, the LiveAnswer platform in 2017, and then becoming more aggressive on customer acquisition at that space. So just wondering, where you stand in that process? And how you feel about the outlook for the communication solutions as we go throughout the remainder of the year?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. Kevin, I'll take that one. As you know, Ruth did a great job of presenting communication related services and our LiveAnswer platform. An update there is a development of that enterprise wide platform continues, in the LiveAnswer cloud-based architecture, again that's what Ruth had talked about the initiative was in Q4 and Q1. We are actively onboarding customers to the new platform, and the focus remains integrating our live voice capabilities, with our automated products, which is a differentiated product in the offering. And if you remember, our automated products are LiveAnswer, they are online scheduling and automated appointment reminders, certainly it provides us a differentiated servicing offering in the marketplace.", "Kevin Mark Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "All right. Perfect. Well, thanks for taking my questions.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thanks, Kevin.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.", "Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Good afternoon. Thank you. Just had a question around just the SG&A run rate. Could you give us a sense both short-term, what you're thinking in terms of trying to chase lot more volume, and what the SG&A will do short-term? And then longer-term, do you guys have a plan to integrate your IT systems, so that SG&A can get to a more normalized run rate longer-term? Just any thoughts around that.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah, Hamzah, I think, as you saw in the quarter, one of the numbers we shared is after the 8-K adjustments, we came in at about $20.7 million. Thinking about that going forward into 2017, and as we talked about on the Investor Day, we should expect that number to come up first, and part of that is making investments into systems that will enable us in the longer-term to be able to get the leverage and the scale that you're suggesting. So I think it's a sequence of events. You first have to make investments in the business. That will manifest itself in a little bit of an increase in SG&A. It's built into the guidance numbers that we gave. And I think over the long-term, you'll be able to see us, be able to put that system to work for us both in supporting SG&A as well as growth drivers in the business.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "And Hamzah, I think in the longer-term, obviously, we want to leverage SG&A. When you say normalized SG&A, I think it's always been difficult to find a period at Stericycle. If you look at up against, I don't think a traditional solid waste company is a good peer. We obviously have a higher SG&A run rate than they do, but then if you look at us vis-\u00e0-vis some business service organizations and companies, we actually have a more favorable SG&A as a percentage of revenue. But obviously, the long-term plan is to leverage all of our assets, get the right systems in place to bring SG&A down over time.", "Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay. And then just on the Shred-it business, what mix are you running right now in terms of off-site versus on-site shredding? And is that going according to plan, or are you seeing pushback from customers in sort of conversion? I know last year you guys had said that the timing was too aggressive to convert some customers. I'm just curious what the update there is?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yes. As you recall, when we first acquired Shred-it, the mix was about 60% on-site and 40% off-site, with a goal of flipping that and getting to the point where we have 60% off-site and 40% on-site. So far the team continues to make really good progress. I would say, we're about halfway home there, and that's one of the many things contributing to the fact that we are able to hit our synergy targets through the end of the year.", "Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Great. Just last question, I'll turn it over. So your guidance looks like it's coming down by $0.03 on a net basis, just the \u2013 both sides, low and high end. And I know you mentioned this a bit, is there any change to the underlying operating guidance? Is this just the divestiture coming out and FX being a little more negative, and then maybe being offset by better SOP pricing, or just underlying operationally is anything changing?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "No. Nothing operationally is changing from the guidance that we gave. And the divestiture did not have an impact to EPS. The change is really for two things. Foreign exchange, we've continued to see the dollar strengthen and with the Trump administration, we've also heard that we expect that to continue. That's about $0.04 to $0.05 of impact next year. That's partially offset with the acquisitions that we completed and that will contribute about $0.01 or $0.02. Those are the only adjustments we have. So what that does is, it nets to a guidance going forward of $4.54 to $4.74.", "I also think it's really important on how we pace ourselves for the year on that. You know the Q1s over the last couple of years have historic seasonality in it for our environmental solutions business. So I think you're best to start the year in the range of about $1.02 and $1.08. And then, you'll ratchet it up from the last three quarters of the year.", "Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Got it. Thank you.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Barbara Noverini. Your line is open.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Hey, good afternoon, everybody.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Hey, Barb.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Hey, Barb.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Hey, so the nine tuck-in acquisitions in the quarter, what lines of business were they in?", "Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc.", "Barbara, I'll take that. We did nine, five of them domestically, four of them were secure information destruction, one regulated waste, and the four that we did internationally were all in secure information destruction.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Okay, great. Thanks. And then if you were to pull the recalls out of the business, what would be the underlying growth rate of communication solutions year-over-year?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "I think from a communication solutions standpoint, Barb, I don't have the number directly in front of me. I think it generally runs around 3%.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "So I think if you pulled out recalls and returns, recalls of $53 million, it's around 3% growth.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Around 3%, okay. And then just one more. Last quarter you guys talked about having some good success on the LQ side of things and in Sharps Management selling. Did that continue into the quarter? Are you still seeing good success there, or is that something unique to last quarter in terms of some of the business that you had been pursuing?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "No, Barb, we continue to see ongoing adoption of both our Sharps Management program and our Rx waste program. So continued kind of steady as she goes.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Okay. All right, great. Thanks, guys.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thank you, Barb.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman from Stifel. Your line is open.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thank you very much. Hi, Charlie, Dan, Brent. How are you doing?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Hey, Michael.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "So the $450 million to $470 million of free cash that's guided for 2017, what's that compared to in 2016?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Michael, you're garbled up a little bit, Michael. Can you repeat the question, I am sorry.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "The $450 million to $470 million of free cash in 2017, what's that compared to, to 2016?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. The adjusted free cash flow that we ended for 2016 came in at $476 million. So that's first look at it with the adjustments that we have of FX, I think, is right in line with where we are. The EPS is relatively flat. We did bring it a little bit down just from the things we talked about FX and acquisition, so generally in line with last year.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. So that's a different display than when we saw at the Analyst Day. At the Analyst Day, you were showing us a guidance of about $400 million compared to the $450 million for 2017 on the bottom-end. So I...", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "From what I can see, Michael, I believe our cash flow guidance, free cash flow of $450 million to $470 million is unchanged.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "I think the confusion on the Investor Day, wasn't that like a year-to-date number, and not a full-year number. I thought that was it, but the guidance has not changed on free cash flow, it was $450 million to $470 million at the Investor Day.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yeah. I get that. But at the Investor Day, I just want to be clear, I mean, at the Investor Day, we all walked out of there thinking you were going to grow free cash in 2017 on a like-to-like basis to what the 2017 number was versus how you done in 2016. Now, what I'm hearing is the free cash is actually down on a like-to-like basis?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Was it 2016 (30:47)", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "You know what, Michael, I think that the challenge there is that I believe in the Investor Day, you may have seen the as reported number. Just to be clear, our as reported free cash flow for 2016 is $411 million. That translates to an adjusted of $476 million. The guidance that we gave from an adjusted is $450 million to $470 million. So, I think, maybe that will help from an apples-to-apples.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. So, what are the \u2013 what's the assumption of adjustments in the $450 million to $470 million?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "I would expect we're in a run. The adjusted items and again those will get taxed different. Usually I think and I have that \u2013 I would assume that going forward, the adjusted EPS is going to be in the range of about $0.40 to $0.45 per quarter of adjustments at an EPS, the dollar associated with it. I don't have that exact breakout, but you can probably back into the number on that.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. So, 0.425, times 91 million, times four is what you're telling me?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. That's about the average, right around \u2013 between $0.40 and $0.45 per quarter of adjusting items.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then you've given \u2013 in the last two quarters you've done a look forward more than just the EPS, so a little bit of thought around your free cash and as well as even an EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA number, what's your thoughts about 1Q in the context of this ability to look forward 90 days and say, it's what we think our business can do?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "I think from an EBITDA percentage, I think from a Q1 21.5% is what we feel would be at the start of the year, Michael, from an EBITDA perspective.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "That's going to ramp up. From an EBITDA, Michael, as in Q1, you're looking at about 19%, and then you should go to about 21% for the full year.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. So, fiscal 2017 is 21%, but 1Q is 19%?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "19%. And again that factors into the seasonality as well as in the front half of the year, you have additional fringe that comes in the beginning of the year, and then you would be able to ramp up from that. It also takes into consideration the investments that we talked about.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And so, on a apples-to-apples basis, what that percentage in Q4.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Why don't I bridge you Q4 going to Q1 on how they would shape out. You are going to expect a normalization of the expert business. And to the midpoint, that's about $20 million. In addition, you've got the normal ease of seasonality that will bring it down some and then you have higher fringe, higher corporate. So you're going to really take the adjusted Q4 EBITDA at about $22 million and it will come down to about $19 million, and then begin to ramp up from there. If you look at it, it's the same effect that you'd have, that you see on the EPS in prior years too. It definitely steps down due to the same factors.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then do we have a little steeper year-over-year comparative on M&I, because you still declined in the 2Q from 1Q in 2016. So is this maybe even a little deeper cut because of that M&I comparison?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "No. When you look at our guidance, we just gave, Michael, compared to the guidance we gave last quarter, it's roughly down $5 million, but that really is more to do with the divested asset and foreign exchange.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then on M&I, I get selling a business at the bottom of the cycle doesn't make a lot of sense. And so I'm not hearing this is taken off the table entirely, but you're not going to sit here and put yourself in a position and trying to negotiate out of a position of weakness. So at some future date, this could be revisited?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "We revisit all of our assets and we look at it by country, by service line, but right now we don't anticipate selling this asset anytime in the future. We think it has potential and a long-term fit with Stericycle. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Your line is open.", "Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review", "Yes. A question on the success you've had with the Shred-it cross-selling, the services there. Are you bundling that with the waste management? And if so, are you giving discounts on the waste management side for those contracts?", "Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. I would tell you Jason that most of the cross-sell success has been built off of relationships. So we've got a strong relationship with a national customer or a system or a hospital and with that credibility, we bring in our counterpart, and it just puts them in a good light with regard to credibility that we deliver on what we say we're going to do. So, most of the success so far has been around those relationships.", "Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review", "And then, looking at the amount of synergies from Shred-it, how much was realized in 2016 and is $20 million still the target for 2017?", "Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yes. I'm happy to report that in 2016 we were able to achieve the $31 million, that we've discussed previously, and our goal is to obviously hit the $20 million in 2017, that we talked about.", "Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review", "And just a question on the income statement in the fourth quarter. That $7.1 million in other expense, what is that and was that excluded from the adjusted results?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "There was a small part of the 8-K that did affect other income and expense as well as, there was entry due to the settlement of a note between the UK about $2.5 million of that due to the 8-K and the rest was the settlement of a note and about a $1.5 million of that was FX.", "Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review", "But the dollar that you reported, does that include the $7.1 million?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "It does. It does.", "Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review", "Okay. Thank you.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Good afternoon, guys.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Hey, Al.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "I wanted to focus on two areas, most of the questions have been fired at. On the international front, the organic growth of 4.5%, could you talk about the components there of what drove what seems to be a fairly healthy number?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah, we did. We had a good result from the international. It also had some headwinds from the patient transport exit that we talked about previously. Really what drove international were international recall revenue. So we reported $53 million, obviously, that's the U.S. recall but some of those events were global events, so that really drove that 4.5% rounded 5% with the recall. I think if you take that out, Al, it had probably a 2% impact, so we would have came in around 3% growth if you extract the international recall revenues.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And then just the follow-on, is that business \u2013 the international recall or I mean let me ask you differently, was the profitability better on the organic business or was it influenced by the recall business, which has I think a good cash flow business, but I'm not sure about the margin profile?", "Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc.", "No. The profitability was about consistent on all the other underlying businesses. Obviously, with the recall event like that, it flowed through a little bit better than company average and little bit better than the international average. The recall would have been partially responsible for the uptick of that, rest of the business operated relatively consistent from what we've seen.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And then, like domestically have we seen any change on the pricing environment, on the international front, I know the 8-K addressed part of that, but I'm surprised that the growth rates maybe implied by the guidance. We wouldn't have had some impact on the revenue side there.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "No. I mean, we've talked about SQ pricing, which was the third part of your question. That doesn't have anything to do with the international. We continue to grow our international businesses, obviously different countries at different stages, some drive growth through new med waste services, some drive growth through additional services. So I think that came in as we expected and guided for in the last call. Again, the uptick in international had to do with the international recall revenues.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And then just a clarification. The pricing that you are assuming in the Security Information business, particularly sorted office papers, had a fairly good run, or maybe tonnage that you're assuming in 2017?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. The pricing has gone up. It's slightly above the range that we had, when we gave you guidance. Our range was anywhere from $147 to $167 a ton with $157 being the midpoint. What was the other half of your question, Al?", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "The assumption.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "The assumption, Al, midpoint of the guidance is $157, and there has been no changes to the volume in that.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "And the volume, as we shared at the Investor Day, is anywhere worldwide, between 700,000 tons and 800,000 tons.", "Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Okay. All right. I'll follow-up. Thank you.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thanks, Al.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joel Kaufman with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just any update on what the incremental margin profile of the recalls business actually looks like today, and just trying to understand what the normalized EBIT margin would have been this quarter ex sort of the recalls, be ex the write down?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. The incremental contribution to EBITDA, if you looked at our guidance, we gave guidance of about 21.5%, it came in on an as reported of 18.6%. We were unfavorably impacted by the 8-K that was about 340 basis points, the remainder is about 50 basis points of improvement that came from a combination of things, that would be the higher recall, foreign exchange, it actually helps EBITDA a little bit because you have lower margin business coming out, and then, the higher paper prices contributed as well. So, a combination of all of those when normalized for the 8-K was about 50 basis points of improvement.", "Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great. And then, just to clarify on the paper shredding business. To what extent did price on the recycle paper side contribute to any of the organic growth this quarter?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "It's about $2 million \u2013 it contributed about $2 million to growth, and that's spread over both domestic and international.", "Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great. And then the last one from me. Just on capital allocation, looking back to comments you guys made at the time of the Shred-it acquisition, you guys discussed rapidly delevering to sort of pre-transaction levels by 2017. Obviously, not pacing towards that. And in light of the headwinds that you guys have seen over the past year and a half, just trying to understand two things. One, if deleveraging is still a priority, and two, any framework to think about leverage targets over the next several years?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. I think unfortunately sometimes good success gets lost in the numbers. We did come in at 3.42. Part of the reason that we went back on that is the adjustment to EBITDA due to the 8-K. And the unfortunate thing is that offset really over $200 million that we have paid down in debt. So when you've adjusted the EBITDA on the calculation it's taken it away. We did start a pretty good progress of delevering, but our allocation strategy hasn't changed and it doesn't change from what we gave you at the Investor Day for 2017 and that's really the majority of our cash is going to go to debt reduction.", "We will contribute anywhere in the range of about $110 million to $130 million towards acquisitions, but I would say that our strategy hasn't changed. I think you'll see strong delevering. We've had an incredible cash flow as we just shared on Michael's question that from a free cash flow standpoint with a 2016 range of $450 million to $470 million, we were above that. So we're continuing to put that cash to work for us. We will make progress on our delevering.", "Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back \u2013 oh, pardon me, your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Your line is open.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Just one quick follow-up, if I may.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Sure.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "At the Analyst Day, you had $0.19 for investing back into the business offset by a positive $0.17 for repurchasing the convertible, is that still in the model?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah, Michael. Nothing has changed from that strategy. So you didn't see \u2013 we did not make any changes operationally, whether it'd be for mandatory or for the investments that we're going to make, the underlying business remains the same the \u2013 it did contribute to the Q1 jump off point of $1.02 to $1.08, and that's really where you're beginning to see that $0.19 kick in.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then lastly, what was the per share impact of the repurchase in 4Q, because we can't, you've got to figure out what that premium...", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yes, the simple math on that, Michael, is it comes to $0.04 of EPS...", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "$0.04", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "From the mandatory preferred.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Great.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thanks, Michael.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thanks.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hi, guys. It's dial in (45:33) for Scott. Can you please elaborate a little bit on what you're seeing in the M&I segment, and how you would categorize the visibility now heading into 2017, and what you saw in the fourth quarter?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. I would say it's consistent over the last couple of quarters. We still have every single quarter about $15 million to $20 million of project work. We've got a good pipeline, and I think as I said earlier a couple of times in my comments, that business has stabilized. I think we have good visibility to it. There is still obviously every quarter project work that we have to fill, but that project work is down significantly from where it was 12 months to 18 months ago.", "Unknown Speaker", "Okay. Thanks. And lastly, can you help us think about the gross margin progression as we go through 2017?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. We're thinking about gross margin going forward, I'd start year-to-year at around 42%, slightly down from the 42.6%, and it has to do with the normalization of the recall that we had as well as the seasonality. From that 42%, I think you have a full year of about 43.5% gross margin.", "Unknown Speaker", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Larry Keusch, with Raymond James. Your line is open.", "Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Thanks. Good afternoon, guys.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Hey, Larry.", "Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey, Charlie. I'm wondering if you could just spend a moment and provide some thoughts around the acquisition strategy for secure document destruction overseas. Obviously, you did a bunch this quarter. So, if you could talk about kind of geographically, where you are going or what markets you're kind of going after and maybe also talk a little bit about the margin profile of these acquisitions that you're going after.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Sure I think if you think about our international footprint, there are some markets where we have secure information only businesses today, and there are some markets where we're in that we don't have any secure information, but we have certainly operational platforms there for medical waste. So, one of the acquisitions we did internationally, actually was in Spain. So, we are able to acquire a leading secure information destruction business in Spain, and then take our operational assets and help that business from a leverage standpoint, where we park our trucks, using it now to sell secure information to the healthcare customers we have in that market. Very similar to the United States and the Shred-it acquisition.", "Certainly in markets where we currently have Shred-it assets, we add on acquisitions, where we think we can get either tuck-in, so we'll do tuck-in acquisitions to leverage the existing secure information businesses that we have in those markets, or it might be an expansion of the geography where we're not currently in. So that's really how we're looking at secure information. Margins vary by geography. For the most part, if you look at Shred-it margins globally, where our Shred-it margins in the U.S. and Canada they are very similar.", "Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Perfect. And then, one other question. Just wanted to get your updated thoughts around the data analysis model that you were working on relative to assessing your SQ customers in the U.S. and trying to predict those that would require some revisions on pricing versus those that may not, and how you're thinking about again potentially accelerating contract renewals where applicable?", "Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc.", "Hey, Larry, I'll take that one. This is Brent. Just to reiterate for everyone, the purpose of that investment was really to enable us to use big data in those powerful analytical tools to pinpoint specific areas of opportunity. A lot of work has been done in the quarter, the team put together the data, the tools are now in place. It is early in the process, and we continue to run a number of pilots to learn what works best, early indications are showing positive signs. Some examples would be we take data around people who attend webinars, people that sign into our website and create safety plans or respond to certain promotional e-mails.", "What we do is we use that data then to target customers for additional incremental sales and the goal and what we're showing is it improves our overall close rates, so we can be more productive as a sales organization. That's one of many, many different ways that we're using this data to help make us more effective as an organization.", "Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Terrific. Thanks guys.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "There are no more questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thank you, Devon. Well, thank you again for joining. We look forward to seeing some of you at various conferences and road shows in the coming months ahead. Have a great evening. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Stericycle's Second Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Jennifer Koenig, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.", "Jennifer Koenig - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thank you, Ben. Good afternoon and welcome to Stericycle's second quarter 2017 conference call. I will now read the Safe Harbor statement. This conference call may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, for example, general, economic and market conditions. Our actual results could differ significantly from the results described in the forward-looking statements.", "Factors that could cause such differences include changes in governmental regulations of the collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of regulated waste or the proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information; completion and court approval of the proposed resolution of the class action litigation; increases in transportation and other operating costs; the level of governmental enforcement of regulations governing regulated waste collection and the treatment or proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information; our obligation to service our substantial indebtedness and to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our private placement notes, term loan credit facility and revolving credit facility; our ability to execute our acquisition strategy and to integrate acquired businesses; competition and demand for services in the regulated waste and secure information destruction industries; political, economic and currency risks related to our foreign operations; impairments of goodwill, intangibles, or other long-lived assets; variability in the demand for services we provide on a project or nonrecurring basis; exposure to environmental liabilities; fluctuations in the price we receive for the sale of paper; the outcome of pending or future litigation; disruptions in or attacks on our information technology systems; compliance with existing and future legal and regulatory requirements; as well as other factors described in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent 10-Q.", "As a result, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results or trends. We make no commitment to disclose any subsequent revisions to forward-looking statements.", "I'll now turn it over to Stericycle's Chief Executive Officer, Charlie Alutto.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thanks, Jennifer. Hello, everybody. Thank you for joining us on today's call. Overall, we were pleased with our second quarter performance. Highlights for the quarter included; our Secure Information Destruction business once again delivered strong growth. Our Communication and Related Service business had another strong quarter, primarily due to recall performance, and we signed an agreement for the divesture of the majority of the patient transport business in the UK.", "Also, after the market close yesterday, we filed an 8-K announcing that Stericycle amended various credit agreements with its lenders. These amendments are in connection with the preliminary agreement to settle the small quantity, customer class action lawsuit. Under the proposed settlement, which is being finalized and remain subject to court approval, we will establish a common fund of $295 million. The fund will be used to pay all compensation to members of the settlement class and other costs of the settlement, including fees to the attorneys representing the class. The existing contracts with our customers will remain in force. We will also establish new guidelines for future price increases and provide customers additional transparency.", "Stericycle is admitting no fault or wrongdoing. We decided to pursue a settlement in order to avoid the uncertainty and expense of continued litigation and to focus on our business. Joining me on today's call to discuss these highlights and other items from the quarter will be Dan Ginnetti, CFO; and Brent Arnold, COO.", "I'll now turn it over to Dan.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thank you, Charlie. The results for the second quarter are as follows. Global revenues were $917.7 million, an increase of 2.9% from $891.6 million in Q2 2016. Organic growth, when adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions, divestitures, and Manufacturing and Industrial Services was 4.1%. Domestic and Canada revenues were $737.7 million. Organic growth, when adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange and acquisitions was 5.1%.", "As previously discussed and expected, growth rates were adversely impacted by Manufacturing and Industrial Services. International revenues were $180.1 million. Organic revenue, when adjusted for foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures, declined 2.7%. As previously discussed and expected, international growth rates were adversely impacted by the exiting of certain patient transportation contracts and Manufacturing and Industrial Services.", "Acquisitions contributed $8.6 million to growth in the quarter and divestitures reduced revenues by $0.8 million. Gross profit was $381.8 million, or 41.6% of revenues. Adjusted SG&A excluding amortization was $198.7 million, or 21.6% of revenues.", "Adjusted income from operations or EBITA was $183.1 million, or 20% of revenues. Net interest expense was $23.7 million. The as reported tax rate for the quarter was 33.8%, or an adjusted rate of 37.1%.", "Net loss attributable to Stericycle was $148.8 million or a loss per share of $1.74 on an as reported basis, primarily due to the impact of the proposed class action settlement. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.15.", "Now for the balance sheet. Our covenant debt to EBITDA ratio was 3.46 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of the revolver was approximately $676 million. In the quarter, we repurchased 175,500 shares of mandatory preferred convertible on the open market in the amount of $12.6 million. At the end of the quarter, we have authorization to purchase an additional 2.8 million shares.", "Year-to-date, cash from operations was $237.1 million. When adjusted for recall reimbursement and other items, cash from operations was $284.4 million. Year-to-date CapEx was $63.1 million, or 3.5% of revenues. In the quarter, our CapEx was $30 million or 3.3% of revenues. Our DSO was 63 days.", "I will now turn it over to Brent.", "Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thanks, Dan. This quarter, we closed six tuck-in acquisitions. The acquisitions include four in the U.S. and two international. These acquisitions contributed revenues of approximately $0.2 million in the quarter, with projected annualized revenues of $3.5 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust, with well over $100 million annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business.", "In the quarter, we saw strong sales and operational performance from the Secure Information Destruction team, another solid quarter from our Communication and Related Services team, and we signed an agreement to divest the majority of the patient transport business in the UK.", "Our Secure Information Destruction revenue was strong for both re-occurring and one-time purge services. This sales activity, combined with higher recycling revenue, generated organic growth of 9.7%. Sales performance once again was driven by the investments we've made in our sales team, the impact of our cross-selling initiatives, and the team's ability to convert the unvended market.", "We are pleased with the progress the team has made in the past year. In addition, the integration of Shred-it and our subsequent tuck-in acquisitions remain on track.", "Communication and Related Services delivered strong performance during the quarter. We maintained the momentum of the past two quarters, while continuing to grow and diversify our customer base. Our investment and technology and infrastructure is driving consistent improvement in both service levels and efficiency.", "As previously discussed, Stericycle made the decision to exit our patient transport business in the UK. At the end of the second quarter, we successfully completed an agreement to divest many of these contracts. We will continue to service the two remaining contracts which expire before year end. Exiting this business in 2017 will allow the team to focus exclusively on growing our core services.", "In closing, we would like to thank all of our worldwide team members for their continued commitment to our customers, our shareholders, and our core values.", "I will now turn it over to Charlie.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thank you, Brent. I would now like to provide insight on our current guidance for 2017. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration and acquisition-related expenses and other adjusted items.", "For 2017, we believe EPS will be in the range of $4.55 to $4.69 using a share count of approximately 91 million. This includes the impact from current foreign exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures. We believe revenues for 2017 will be in the range of $3.52 billion to $3.65 billion using current foreign exchange rates.", "The worldwide revenue guidance for each of our service lines is, Regulated Waste and Compliance Services will be in the range of $2.0 billion to $2.05 billion, which includes the impact of the divested patient transport business.", "Secure Information Destruction Services will be in the range of $795 million to $825 million. Communication and Related Services will be in the range of $355 million to $385 million, depending on recall revenues.", "Manufacturing and Industrial Services will be in the range of $365 million to $385 million. We believe adjusted free cash flow in 2017 will be in the range of $450 million to $470 million. 2017 CapEx is anticipated to be between $125 million to $150 million. We expect the 2017 full-year adjusted tax rate to be at or slightly below 36.5%. We are pleased with the second-quarter results, and we are confident in the long-term outlook for our business.", "Thank you for your time today. We will now answer any questions. Please keep in mind that we have many analysts who follow Stericycle. We ask that you limit yourself to a couple of questions. Ben, you can now open the Q&A line.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair.", "Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Hey guys.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Hey, Ryan.", "Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I'll follow up with one on the settlement. I'm not sure how much you can say, but can you talk a little bit more, number one, about, the potential timing of the payment and how that might impact your capital deployment? And then number two, any more color on what the guidelines are for future price increases and what you mean by increased transparency that you'll provide to customers?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Sure. Let me take about the settle amount paid and the timing. We don't have any definitive timing for the payment and we must continue this process as this has been a \u2013 until it's preliminarily approved by the court. It's unlikely though, Ryan, that this payment will be made during 2017. I'll let Dan touch on the capital allocation and then I'll come back to your transparency question.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. Ryan, I think the way I would look at this is it's not a significant change if any at all for our capital allocation strategy. The amendments to our covenants allow the one-time add back to the EBITDA portion. So for the time period that we do not make the payment, there will be no change to our EBITDA, or our debt-to-EBITDA. In the future when we do make a cash payment, we do expect that, that will be an impact in the range of about 25 to 30 basis points. We have room currently with that EBITDA add-back under our revolver or under our debt to EBITDA covenants. And so I think that we can continue our capital allocation strategy as we've had it. We'll certainly continue to work on debt reduction. That's an important part of what we have been doing and will continue to do in the future.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. And then, back to your question, Ryan, on transparency. I think you touched on the exact requirements for the settlement have not been finalized yet or approved by the court. However, I think it's important to note that at Stericycle, we are committed to service agreements that contain fixed annual price adjustments which we've been implementing over the past several years now.", "Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. So no major change there. And then, I guess, the other follow-up question I would have is, what's your opinion of the potential for the settlement to accelerate some of the pricing pressure you've seen and kind of eliminate this on a more rapid basis as either the media grabs a hold of this or as the plaintiffs' attorneys reach out to the class and inform them about the settlement opportunity.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. I think first, obviously, this lawsuit has been publicized for several years and during that time, we've been successfully working with our customers to maintain their business. We may see higher retention call volume with this settlement. We certainly may see it when the class participants are contacted. We'll continue to monitor it very closely. If we think there is any change to our forecasted growth rates, we'll certainly let you guys know on future calls.", "Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. Appreciate the color. Thank you, and congrats on moving beyond this.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thanks, Ryan.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sean Dodge with Jefferies.", "Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC", "Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe starting with Regulated Waste revenue. It was up sequentially, but you were down on a year-over-year basis. I know you were lapping a pretty tough comp. Is there anything else you can add there to help us understand why organically that was down?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. If you look back at our original guidance Sean, we originally had forecasted that for the year it was going to be down to flat in the ranges that we gave at the beginning of the year. And if you look at the current range that we have estimated for the year, total growth will be somewhere between a negative 3% and flat. So, it wasn't unexpected given the price pressures that we have. And if you take out the PTS or patient transport business from the guidance that we provided and the exiting of certain contracts, we were slightly ahead on a growth perspective, about 0.5 percentage point.", "Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then I think, at this point, all of the incremental investment you all have talked about in marketing, in data analytics and the sales head count, have been made. Are there any encouraging early signs you're seeing of those beginning to get traction? And maybe how soon should we expect to see traction there?", "Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc.", "Hey, Sean, this is Brent. You're all too familiar with the investments we've made. I would say, so far, we're pleased. It's still early innings, but we are seeing return on investment on those investments.", "I would highlight that as we are faced with this competitive pressure, one of the things we are using is to use predictive analytics to make sure that its customers are at risk or offering them specific offers targeted and making sure they stay with us. So, I would say that's one of the many uses. Others are targeting customers that we think are likely to buy additional services. And so, overall, I'd say we're pleased with how it started. We see a return on investment and again it's still early days.", "Sean Dodge - Jefferies LLC", "All right. Great. Thanks, again.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thanks, Sean. Any \u2013 Ben, are you there? Any questions?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Manthey with Baird.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Hey, guys. Good afternoon.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Hey, David.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Could you talk about alternative dispute resolution, what might that look like? Does that include contract cancellation or modification? And then, in terms of the guidelines for future price increases, is that going to be tied to something external like CPI or some other measure?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Well, we've been transitioning over the last several years, David, to fixed annual price increases in our contract. And currently, our annual price increases on the SQ side nets us CPI plus. So, we do a little bit better than CPI. We don't think that will change with this settlement. I think it's too early to comment on alternative dispute language. I mean, obviously, we have a preliminary settlement that's to be determined. We'll work that out when we go to a definitive agreement. But our part of the preliminary settlement was that our contract will remain in force.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Right. But it sounded like there was some option that customers could take an alternate resolution, and I am just trying to get a handle on, could that mean they could go back to the bargaining table in terms of what they're paying or cancel the contract without penalty et cetera?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "I think that happens today when we have our existing contracts. Customers do call us that are in the middle of contracts and we do renegotiate those contracts with them and we do show flexibility. So I don't think that will change how we approach customers that have current contracts with us.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then just quickly on a couple of add backs here. Contract exit costs, that's running about $5 million per quarter for the last year-and-a-half, I'm trying to understand what that is. And then second, acquisition and integration, I guess, it was $23.7 million this quarter. Is there a point at which that starts to diminish now that we're about two years out from Shred-it?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. So the first one on contract exit costs, as you know, we've been exiting contracts throughout really the course of almost a year in the patient transport business and in fact we've gone to a point now where we've been able to divest the majority of that business. We have two remaining contracts that we are now remained with that we'll run out throughout the course of the year. So I think that you're going to see that contract exit cost normalize after this.", "And then regarding acquisition and integration, I think if you were to compare us the last year, you have seen a decrease. It can be from time-to-time bumpy, so Q1 was down a little bit. I think if you average the two, Q1 and Q2, you see a normalization there and yeah, that is certainly our plan as we've gone through a very complex integration of two material acquisitions that I think by the end of the year our plan is to get that down to a level that supports the level of acquisitions that we continue to do.", "David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Michael Hoffman with Stifel.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. On the price side, on the SQ price issue, you've framed it as $120 million, $40 million this year, I presume that there is no change in that outlook that it's still $120 million in scope and $40 million this year?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. So our long-term scope on that was $120 million to $130 million. We don't think there is any change to that. We did see an increase slightly. If you remember, Q1 pricing came in as expected. We did see a little higher pricing pressure in Q2. We think that may continue for the remainder of Q3 and Q4. So we might go slightly ahead of the $40 million number that we gave out, it might go to the mid $40 million for this year. But the important thing is we think the number, the $120 million to $130 million number still stands.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. So on the speed question, a different version of that is would you accelerate it, now that once you get the court's and there is sort of a Part B on the court, when does the court rule for you? But, would you choose to accelerate the process now that you've cleared the deck on the lawsuit?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. I think on the timing question on the court, I mean, that's really subject to the courts time. So I cannot even speculate on when will the court preliminarily approve the deal that we have with the plaintiffs' attorneys, so that's to be determined.", "I think your follow-up question is a good one, do we accelerate it a little bit? I think that comes down to we're still learning about data analytics and predictive analytics and I think that will help us try to frame that up. Where it makes sense to do that, we may. If we think that that either lowers the timing of this pricing issue or brings the number down, I think that's still to be determined though.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then do the M&I trends turn positive given the secular environment? I know you had a tough comp in 2Q, but does the secular environment, which is improving the M&I trends improve, go positive in the second half?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. If you look at our \u2013 we did bring down the M&I forecast slightly for the rest of the year of the estimate. I think it was $10 million on both the low end and the high end. Q2, we did have a rebound. As you can see in the revenue table, probably a little bit lower than that we had anticipated. As we said before, the pipelines are definitely more robust this year than they were last year. But on those projects it's a matter of timing. I do think we get to a positive growth in that business, so flat to positive by the end of the year, I do believe that.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "All right. Last question for me. So you've had four quarters in a row where you predicted the next quarter's earnings. You want to go for a fifth?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "We'll let Dan do that. Yeah, well, Dan's on a roll. So we'll let Dan answer that one from a Q3 perspective.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. No pressure there, Michael. Let me take you through the changes to the EPS that we have. So, last quarter, our annual guidance was $4.55 to $4.75. We've kind of hit an inflection point on FX to where FX is delivered some favorability of about a penny in our guidance. But that's offset by about a penny, offset due to the divestiture of the patient transport business, those two additional contracts that we'll run until they terminate, kind of offset that.", "Beyond that, I think what you're going to see in the guidance here is that in the first half of the year, outside of the impact of interest and repos, the EPS associated with operations has been at about the midpoint of our guidance. Being halfway through the year, it's clear it will not be at the top end of our guidance. So we chose to bring the top end down about $0.06 to align with that. What you saw is that we held the bottom end due to the certainty of how customer base will respond in the second half of the year to the news of this settlement. So we thought that was the prudent exercise in our guidance. Going into Q3, I think the comfortable range that I would put us in is the range of about $1.13 to $1.19 with the full year 2017 EPS guidance of $4.55 to $4.69.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thank you very much. And good luck on number five.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Great. Thank you, Michael.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Jon Windham with Barclays.", "Jon Windham - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, Dan and Charlie, thanks for taking the question. May be just to build on little bit of the question that was previously asked about the $120 million headwind. You're about a third of the way through that on the sort of pipeline you had set out before. Can you talk a little bit around how confident you are in that number, not so much on the future timing of just where you're to-date against where you thought you would have been say a year ago? Thanks.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah, Jon, I will take that one, this is Charlie. You're right. I think at the end of this year we'll be about a third through. We got $20 million last year, and a little bit over $40 million this year. So I guess it's about a third through. I think we've always said that we are more confident in the total number, the $120 million to $130 million. It does fluctuate. We did see that in Q1 and Q2, it does fluctuate, it fluctuates by month, it fluctuates by quarter. But I think halfway through 2017, we still feel good about the original number that we put out there at the Investor Day of the $120 million to $130 million.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. I think where we stood at the quarter, we're really only about a couple million off of what we had anticipated in the quarter. So, we're still pretty close on guidance and really when you look at why we moved it out, it's just to assume that level through the balance of the year. So we feel pretty good so far on the cadence, but again, as we said, predicting cadence post a settlement is something we wanted to just be cautious about.", "Jon Windham - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Perfect. Thanks, guys.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thanks, Jon.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets.", "Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hey, guys, good afternoon. I'd like to follow up on that. What causes that month-to-month fluctuation? Is this determined by when the client comes back to you, how much they're asking based on what the competition is offering them. I guess I'm trying to understand what's causing that to move around?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Sure, Gary, I'll take that. Thanks for the question. I think when you think about our SQ business, we have hundreds of thousands of contracts. So we have other things going on, that everybody is focused I think on this call on the pricing lawsuit. But let's take a step back, there are a lot of things going in and around the market.", "You've got consolidation of hospitals buying smaller doctor practices based on time to control 100 to 200 accounts in one shot, so if they go out to bid or several of those go out to bid at one time depending on how competitive we get on those contracts, that can sway it, you have managed care cost and what's going on in healthcare, where accounts \u2013 again separate from this lawsuit, are looking to save money on varying services that they get for their office.", "So I think that, it's not just looking at the contract termination, it's just looking at the inflow that we get on a month-to-month basis and it varies. Sometimes it's slower at the end of the year around the holidays, it picks up at other time, sometimes it gets slower, in July and August as doctors are on vacation or office managers are on vacation. So there is a lot of variables that go into the amount of calls that we get and the renegotiations contract.", "Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay, great. And then I wondered, can you provide some color on the Communications business. You said a lot of the upside here was recalls, that business had been in a five-year downtrend and all of a sudden in the last 18 months, you've had a number of extremely strong quarters. Is there a change in your capabilities or change in your competitiveness that's driven this? Or is it just, as you've always talked about it being a variable demand business and you've had a couple of nice wins that have really delivered the results lately?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "I think you called a lot of good thing about a change in some of the services that we offer, which has been positive, yes, kudos to the team. I mean, they've delivered another strong quarter. You're right, the last 18 months trends have been very positive. I want to caution everybody, it still continues to be an uneven business. It's difficult to forecast. We did, however, have a very strong Q2. It was driven by several large recall events.", "And I think the thing I want to call out is we are experiencing recall activity across all the industries that we service. Again, for those that are new to Stericycle, we do recalls for the pharmaceutical industry, the medical device industry, consumer products, food and beverage and about a couple of years ago, we added the automotive recall to our services that we can provide. And I will tell you that auto recalls did accelerate, or our activity did accelerate in Q2. That was part of one of the large events that we did have. And we do offer a very unique services, not just call center, it's notification and response. And we've got a unique service offering to automotive manufacturers that help increase their response rates for the recall notices that they're sending out. So again, the team has done a really good job of reinventing and going after new types of recalls and it's definitely been paying dividends for us over the last 18 months.", "Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Great. Thanks. And then just one last one. Could you provide some commentary like you did last quarter of the Shred-it strong growth? How much of that was paper prices versus the volumes you're driving? And with paper having recently pulled back a bit, did that have much impact on how you're thinking about the guidance for the remainder of the year? Thank you very much.", "Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc.", "Hey, Gary, this is Brent, I'll take that one. Overall, we are really pleased with our growth in Q2. When you break down the 9.7%, about 3.6% of that was contributed by paper, the remaining 6.1% was really driven by strong performance in the team, both our sales executives converting the unvend market as well as our efforts of our inside sales team getting new purge or onetime services. So, overall, very strong performance by the team. With regard to paper, I'll turn it over to Dan.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. From a guidance perspective, as you know, we came out of the year a little bit hot. We've studied that trend and we've kind of monitored how it behaves. We look to historical and I think what we felt is that early victory \u2013 we didn't want to raise guidance, because we saw the likelihood of it coming back to its 10 year average, which you're seeing what's happening. So I think what we anticipate in the back half of the year is that, it moves within the guidance range that we gave you. We shared paper being between $147 to $167. It's now come into the range and I think within the full year, the total number will be within our guidance range. So no change.", "Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thanks, Gary.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Barbara Noverini with Morningstar.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Hello, Barbara.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Hey, everybody. So, with organic revenue growth down year-over-year in regulated medical waste, I just wanted to ask about StrongPak, because I know that's been a good grower for you guys recently. And just commentary over the quarter from some of your peers in hazardous, some of them are pretty excited about the opportunities in either retail hazardous waste or pharmaceutical recalls or what not. So I'm just curious if you continue to see strong trends in StrongPak in the quarter?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah, the theme of retail number, which does flow into our Regulated Waste and Compliance Service line, did have a strong retail quarter. We still grow that business in the high single digits. So we've seen, again, continued adoption of our service. We continue to see adding on now those mid-tier retailers. I think we're really in a good position. We've got a unique pharmaceutical take back program that we've been adding to retailers, obviously, the medical waste is also a service because many of these retailers have Minute Clinics now where they give flu vaccinations. So we continue to see strong growth in that sector.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Okay. Great. Thanks. And just one other quick one on Shred-it. So, there had been some talk that China has been cracking down on exports that they take into the country and I know that with the type of paper that you guys collect, it's pretty high quality, good sorted office paper. So, just curious if you are kind of thinking about that at all, if it will impact your business at all? And secondly, could you kind of breakout how much of your recycled paper goes to domestic mills versus goes overseas?", "Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc.", "Hey, Barbara. I'll take that one. So far, again, as you've seen with the pricing trend, we've continued to be able to find multiple sources for our paper whether that is in North America, Mexico, China, basically all markets. Our recycled paper actually goes to multiple different places all across the globe. Really what drives it is away from home tissue product, so tissue paper, all the types of things, the Kleenex that you would have in hotels. So really we don't see a decline in that demand. If anything, I think the combination of that demand is holding steady and our demand continue to hold steady. I think prices will \u2013 we're optimistic that they'll stay in that 150 range for the foreseeable future.", "Barbara Noverini - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Okay. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Thanks. Good afternoon. Just following up on recalls. Are we to take away that that was the entirety of the upside and the guidance increase for the year in the Communication and Related Services segment? And just curious, is there momentum, that $10 million increase in the revenue, was that all from what it occurred in the first half or is there still some momentum coming in the second half on recalls? Thanks.", "Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. Thanks for your question. As Charlie answered earlier, this is a hard to predict business. We're dependent on recalls for that portion of our business. The guidance that we gave was really the overachieved that we've seen in the first part of the year, because it's hard to predict and because these events had been largely consolidated within the quarters. We thought necessary to assume in the back half of the year the normal level of recall events that we would see. So there is really not much upside. What we brought in the upside is just the overachieved year-to-date.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "All right, thanks. And then, international, the organic growth is down a little bit in this most recent quarter. Was that related to patient transportation or is that something separate or a little bit of both?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Hey, Scott, it's Charlie. Yes. The growth rate for the quarter was negative 2.7%. But you called it. It was negatively impacted by the patient transport Contract business and the Manufacturing and Industrial business. If you actually take those out, international growth would have come in around 3% of what we expected.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Thanks. And following on that Charlie, how are things in Latin America just that had been a sour spot in past quarters? Could you just give us an update on trends you're seeing there? Thanks.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. We definitely saw some pricing pressure in Q1. I would tell you Q2 came in as expected for Latin America.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thanks, Scott.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Capital.", "Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Good afternoon. The first question is just on medical waste pricing. You reiterated the $120 million to $130 million figure, clearly it could vary annually. But just give us a sense where could you be wrong, where could that number be $150 million, $200 million, is it more hospital consolidation, is not in the ninth inning and it's in the second inning, or is there a structural change in the market, are these guys going to mom and pops or just help investors think about that?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Sure, I think, good question, Hamzah. I think if you think about where could we be wrong in the $120 million to $130 million, I mean, certainly there could be changes in the healthcare market where healthcare continues to try to drive price down. They always have done that. Certainly we've dealt with a difficult healthcare market for as long as I can remember of being in the healthcare waste business.", "But, certainly, market conditions could worsen or hospitals could consolidate further. I mean that could be certainly a trend that we'll keep an eye on. I think it's hard to predict, I mean we just announced a settlement, preliminary settlement for the class action suit, what is the reaction to that. When our customers get notices down the road when the court finally has a preliminary approval on the settlement, certainly that could drive things where it could accelerate or even make the $120 million to $130 million number be larger. But, obviously, we're not just sitting here and not doing anything. We've invested in data analytics, we've invested in additional sales resources. So, certainly, we're trying to take actions necessary to make sure that we either come in on that number or do a little bit better than that number.", "Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Very helpful. And then maybe, longer-term, where are you guys in terms of ERP integration and potential SG&A savings? Is that something that you communicate to the Street? I know you have your hands full right now with the settlement and many other things. But is that something that's on the back burner or is that something more of an 2018 event? Just any color, any update there will be great. Thank you.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah, thanks, Hamzah. Certainly not on the back burner. No matter how full our hands are, it's an important part. As we previously discussed, we're right now in a design and evaluation phase of our needs for an ERP system. This will likely take us through the balance of the year to fully and adequately analyze what single system would fit Stericycle's environment. We'll keep you updated as we have in the initiative as it progresses in with the intent to really have a decision by the end of the year. So it certainly is 2018 and beyond event. It's a big decision and we're thoroughly reviewing it and we'll communicate as we progress. But it's forefront in our mind.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "We're going to do something, Hamzah, and I think as Dan said, it's definitely, it could be an 2018 event. But whatever we do, it's going to be a multiyear journey as we look to a single ERP system across all of our businesses and geographies.", "Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Got you. Actually just last clarification question, I will turn it over. Is the $0.06 guidance cut on the high end, is that divestiture or maybe you mentioned this, but I may have missed it?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. It's a couple of things, Hamzah. One of the things Charlie said is while we have a nice rebound, Q1 to Q2 in the M&I business, we didn't rebound as far as we had hoped. And so we took down guidance a little bit in that area. Second thing is that, as we talked about the cadence at which we're experiencing price concessions in the SQ market, a little bit higher by a couple million dollars of what we anticipated in Q2, and we estimate that that level will continue through the balance of the year. So those are the really two things we're bringing it down.", "Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Got it. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Kevin Steinke with Barrington Research.", "Kevin Mark Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Good afternoon. So that 2.7% decline internationally on an organic basis, what do you think that looks like in the second half now that you're divesting a good portion of that patient transport business?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah, we still have a \u2013 thanks, Kevin, this is Charlie. We'll still have the comp issue a little bit on the patient transport and M&I, it's still coming in slightly lower. So, I think, if you remove the noise of patient transport and M&I, we think that our Q3 and Q4 will be around 2% growth for the remainder of the year, internationally.", "Kevin Mark Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. Just can you talk about the composition of the six acquisitions you did in the quarter? And were there any Secure Information and where did those fall if there were?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. The six acquisitions, four of them were in the United States. There were two regulated medical waste acquisitions and two Secure Information Destruction. And then we did two internationally and both of those were regulated medical waste.", "Kevin Mark Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And I assume the pipeline of Secure Information Destruction acquisitions, is that still good? Something you're working on pretty aggressively?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Very good. Pipeline for Secure Information Destruction remains very robust.", "Kevin Mark Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Just lastly, can you give us a quick update on the conversion of Shred-it customers to offsite shredding from onsite, what that percentage is if you've completed that flip that you had hoped to achieve?", "Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc.", "Sure. Kevin, I will take that one. This is Brent. As you know, we started off in 2015 at 58% onsite. I'm happy to report that through Q2 of 2017, and this is now worldwide, we are at 43%. So we're almost all the way through the project you're going from 60% onsite and flipping that to 40%, and the team has done a great job of doing that, but also making sure that we are handling that in a way that our customers are happy.", "Kevin Mark Steinke - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "All right. That sounds great. Thanks for taking the questions.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thanks, Kevin.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Larry Keusch with Raymond James.", "Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey, good afternoon. Maybe for Dan. So I think you reiterated the guidance for gross margin of 43% to 44%, and I think you did 41.5% in the first half. So, just could you help us think about how you walk up towards that guidance range for the full year?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. So, I think that you're really asking for two things here. One is, how do we do according to the guidance and really how do we \u2013 or will there be a change in guidance going forward. So, really compared to the guidance that we gave last quarter, which was 42.5% or approximately in that range, we saw as we spoke of slightly more SQ pricing, but we also saw some strength in growth in our LQ market, which does come in a little less than our average. And that combined to be about 20 basis points difference from our guidance.", "Well, we saw very good growth in M&I. It was a little less than what we anticipated, and that was about 20 basis points off as well. Our international revenues, partly due to the deferred revenue adjustment that we did, was another 20 basis points. And then we gave you some aggressive growth quarter-over-quarter. And while I think, we did a good job of growing that, we achieved about 35 basis points. That was about 30 less than what we had guided to, partly due to some higher cost in the business. So, we came in at 41.6%.", "What I would point to though is, our company is about some puts and takes and where we focus our energy. If you take that story through to the EBITA, we guided to a 20% and we achieved a 20%. So, operationally, we're very pleased with all the groups coming together, we achieved our target there.", "I think, going forward, I would put you at an EBITA for next quarter, at about 20.2% moving to about a 20.5% or slightly they are under for the year. If you want to go down to the gross margin level, I think, Q3, roughly is in the range of about a 42.2% moving up to about a 42.5% and then for SG&A, at about 22% even for both Q3 and full year.", "Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. That was really helpful. And the 42.5% on the gross margin, was that for the fourth quarter or for the year?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "The 42.5% is for the full year.", "Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Perfect. Thanks for that, Dan. And then just on the Secure Information Destruction business, the growth has really been impressive over the last couple of quarters and I recognize what's been driving that. But, as we look forward, is that sort of high single-digit rate of growth, something that you guys are comfortable that this business can sustain?", "Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc.", "Hey, Larry, I'll take that. This is Brent. As you've heard us say before, our goal is net of paper to grow organically this segment by 3% to 5%. So we're very pleased with how the team performed in Q2. I'll remind you though in Q1, we were at 4%, so right in the middle of the range. So, I think, what you're seeing here is a combination of a couple of things, both, really strong performance by the team, but also when you look back and you think about what we were going through this time last year, Q2 of last year is when we announced all of our changes, we announced the re-org, we implemented a bunch of the changes that we had been planning and piloting. So we may be getting a small benefit from a comp of last year as well. So, again, pleased with the number, but prudent for us to stick with the 3% to 5% guidance.", "Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. That's great. And then last one for me, just any update on thoughts around both the Shred-it and outlook for the Stericycle synergies associated with the deal?", "Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. We continue to be right on track with those. So we're really starting to see the benefits of the standard work that we've implemented across all of our network, the investments we've made in customer service and inside sales. Based on the good performance of the team, we remain on track to achieve the remaining $20 million in 2017.", "Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Great. Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.", "Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Thank you so much.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Welcome, Jeff.", "Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "I just wanted to go back to the proposed lawsuit settlement. What are the milestones that we need to reach before that settlement is finalized and what will you be disclosing along that path?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Well, I think I'll basically take you through the two next milestones. Certainly, we need to finalize the settlement and come to a definitive agreement. And then the court needs to hear that and then rule on a preliminary approval. And at that stage, it would then go \u2013 the court would address an administrator that would reach out to the customers and non-customers that would be included in the class. Really I don't want to give any timeline because they're really at the mercy of the court and their schedule, but those are the next several milestones. And obviously, as we get further down the road and things become approved by the court, then certainly there would be more information available.", "Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "And in terms of those two milestones, will you be disclosing them when you reach them?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. I think the definitive agreement will be something that we would disclose on an 8-K and then on the court approval, I think it would be in the public domain as well. So the answer to those questions would be yes.", "Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. Great. And just a couple of modeling questions. What should we be modeling for interest expense for 2017? And then also on the FX line, does it make sense that, that will be turning positive or at least less negative given the way the dollar has been trading in recent weeks? Thanks so much.", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. For interest expense, using approximately $100 million is the right number. From FX, as I mentioned earlier, it's an interesting period of time. Certainly when you're looking backwards, we still have some headwinds in our year-over-year comparison. However, we saw very small favorability, Q1 to Q2, but we gave you $11 million on the revenue line going forward based off current rates. So, what we don't do is predict foreign exchange. We give you guidance based on the last known rate. So we'll continue to moderate that and adjust our numbers accordingly going forward.", "Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Thanks. I must have missed that disclosure, I apologize. Thanks so much.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joel Kaufman from Goldman Sachs.", "Joel Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Hey, thanks for the questions. Hey, Dan, could you potentially isolate the impact from the comms relative to the guidance you provided on the first quarter call. Back of the envelope, just assuming the midpoint of the previously guided range for comms, I'm getting something like $0.07 to $0.10 depending on your assumption for the margin contribution of that business. Just not sure what the pacing assumed in your guidance was the last time you provided it?", "Daniel V. Ginnetti - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. I think we raised guidance by about $12 million due to its outpacing. I think the favorability at least to our guidance was \u2013 within the number, I think what you saw is on our EPS guidance going forward built into that, there's about $0.04 favorability to our EPS guidance directly from the ComSol and Related Services business.", "Joel Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Great. That's very helpful. And then, as a follow-up, appreciate you're no longer breaking out SQ and LQ. But I think your shareholders are really trying to get to the bottom of what core medical waste in the U.S. is growing ex-retail has organically. So just could you potentially give a little bit of color on price and volume specifically in core medical waste?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Sure. I think if you look at that business, you've got our SQ business, obviously, we talked a lot about pricing pressure and the related $40-plus million that we see for that business. But we do have an LQ business that is growing. I think we spoke about this a couple of calls ago. It has probably one of its best growth years. In 2016, it continues to grow well. It's all about additional services. So when we think about core medical waste, you can't just look at regulated medical waste at sharps, it's pharmaceutical waste coming out of hospitals. So I think you got puts and takes on the pricing side and that's offset by some other additional services, which I would call directly related to med waste. I think Brent can add a little more color on some of those things as well.", "Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. Joe, in the quarter we had great results with regard to, continuing to grow our sharps business, had some real nice closes there. We continue to see strong demand for our pharmaceutical waste compliance program in hospitals and then as we've talked about during Investor Day, we're really excited about our controlled substance, Rx Waste program. A lot of customers are interested in that, real value to the community as that takes opioid out of circulation. So we're not only making sure they don't get in the water stream, but we're ensuring that they do not get in the wrong hands. So all of those solutions are growing nicely and as Charlie said, those are some of the ways that we're offsetting some of the competitive pressures in SQ.", "Joel Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Great. Thanks. And then just a last one for me. Any update to the progress with the LiveAnswer launch and then just maybe help us understand if there are incremental investments that still need to be made whether it's in channel or in a software on that platform?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "No. I think the team continues to do well. What you're referring to is something we talked about at the Investor Day, the acquisition of a company called LiveAnswer. We certainly are now on LiveAnswer. We are putting new customers on LiveAnswer. We've been doing that just at the beginning of the year. We started to migrate former ComSol \u2013 our ComSol customers, that were on former platforms onto the LiveAnswer platform as well. So, so far we're on track with respect to that conversion. I think more importantly though, we really are starting to leverage our communication solutions agents that normally doesn't get involved in recall events, that we now have the ability through other technology utilize those agents who were not bringing as many temp employees when we get a large recall event that has a call center notification component to it. So I would tell you that the LiveAnswer launch and conversion remains on track.", "Joel Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Just as a follow-up, would it be fair to say that the incremental margins on recall now should then theoretically be higher than they had been in the past?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "For those services that have a call center component where we are able to leverage those ComSol events. So I don't want to paint the picture that every recall event is call center, sometimes it's data management, other times it's actually going on retrieving items from the marketplace, it could be disposing of materials and obviously we're not leveraging. But when we can leverage our call center operators, yes, we get a higher profitability for that work.", "Joel Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thanks, Joel.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review.", "Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review", "Yeah, just a follow-up on the SQ side of things, for core medical waste. I don't know if you could provide any data as far as the retention rate of the SQ medical waste customers that have not been consolidated just looking over the last few quarters?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah, I think from a revenue retention rate, our SQ med waste business is in low 90%s, So I think that's what you're looking for, that's a data point that we have. I think that's all SQ. I don't have a breakdown of who has not been consolidated. We've talked about our SQ business, about 20% of our SQ business, I think when you're talking about Jason is the consolidation of large healthcare buying small practices, certainly about 20% of our SQ business has, it's either affiliated or owned by a large quantity, that leaves about 80% of SQ customers. But of that number, about 25% to 30% are national accounts. When we look at revenue retention for SQ, we're looking at the total business. I don't have the breakout for those that are not consolidated.", "Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review", "And as you talk about SQ medical waste, as you define it, what percent of total corporate revenue would be considered SQ medical waste currently?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. I think going into the year before the pricing pressure, U.S. SQ medical waste was roughly between $700 million and $750 million, total. And again that includes national accounts, that includes hospital affiliate or hospital owned, and then general SQ, which includes a variety of different healthcare and non-healthcare customers.", "Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review", "You said that was going into the year?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. And then, obviously, we've got pricing pressure. So, specifically, obviously it's $40 million of pricing pressure in that $700 million to $750 million.", "Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review", "All right. Thank you.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thanks, Jason.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel again.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thanks for letting me do the follow-up. In the past, you've given us recall returns actual sales. So what was that and then in the quarter?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. As you know, Michael, we've moved away from the recall because again, the consolidation of everything between communication solutions and recall. We did guide, you're right, we did talk about, I think, beginning of the year we said, RMS global was roughly $125 million to $150 million. We're obviously outperforming that. I'd say the new guidance for the year includes a global number of $135 million to $160 million. And then to answer your question specifically, we're probably on the high end of that range for the quarter. So, $40 million to $45 million going forward.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then, Brent, on your cross-selling into the RMW business; sharps, pharma, Rx Waste, they've been trending sort of mid or high single digits. Is that still the case?", "Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. I would say, overall, I would take that down a little bit. I would say 3% to 5% range is more where we're seeing our hospital cross-selling and incremental services.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then on document destruction, of the 6.1%, how much of that's recurring versus purge on the ex-paper, it's 9.6% organic; ex-paper 6.1%?", "Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yeah. Michael, we don't break that out. I would tell you though the majority of that is our reoccurring auto business.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "The ones that we can break out these all the organic, Michael, which may be helpful of the organic growth about 25% is price and 75% is volume/new sales. But the volume/new sales to Brent's point is a combination of automatic service and purge or one-time, but again, a majority, an overwhelming majority of that is reoccurring.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. That's the powerful part of the statement, it's reoccurring.", "Brent Arnold - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yes.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Yes.", "Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yeah. All right. Thank you.", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "Thanks, Michael. Have a great night.", "Operator", "There are no more questions in queue. Do you have any closing remarks?", "Charles A. Alutto - Stericycle, Inc.", "I do, Ben. Thank you so much. I want to thank everybody for joining us in today's call. We'll look forward to seeing you on the road in the coming weeks and months ahead. Have a great evening and enjoy the rest of the summer.

My name is Sarah and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Stericycle\u2019s Third Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce to your host for today, Ms. Jennifer Koenig, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Ms. Koenig, the line is yours.", "Jennifer Koenig", "Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining Stericycle\u2019s call today. The discussion during today\u2019s call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ significantly from those described in such forward-looking statements.

In the quarter, our Secure Information Destruction, hospital-regulated waste and retail and healthcare hazardous waste services all have strong performance. Our small quantity healthcare and communication related services performed consistent with our expectations. Also in the quarter, manufacturing and industrial came in lower than anticipated, we experienced cost pressures in Latin America and we were impacted by several hurricanes across the Gulf Coast, Florida and Puerto Rico.", "Prior to our detailed review of the quarterly results, I would like to introduce a comprehensive business transformation management initiative that we are undertaking to improve our long-term operational and financial performance. Since our inception, the company has grown through 490 acquisitions resulting in many different systems, business processes and resource redundancies across the organization. Although Stericycle has traditionally been a lean company, we see substantial opportunities to improve our operations. The transformation will impact all of Stericycle\u2019s service lines and geographies. While the initiative is expected to take 3 to 5 years to complete, we anticipate positive contributions to the business starting into early 2018.", "The business transformation includes the following key initiatives. The implementation of an enterprise resource planning, or ERP technology platform to consolidated the company\u2019s multiple systems, the restructuring of our organization and consolidation of select operations, the improvement of business processes across the organization, including route planning and logistics, and the reduction of spend through improved procurement processes. This business transformation will improve the long-term financial and operational performance of Stericycle. We will provide a more detailed review of the initiatives, the cost and expected savings during our Q4 earnings call in February.", "I will now turn the call over to Dan.", "Dan Ginnetti", "Thanks, Charlie. The results for the third quarter are as follows. Global revenues were $882.8 million, a decrease of 0.8% from $890.1 million in Q3 2016. Organic revenue, when adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions, divestitures and manufacturing and industrial services, increased 0.2%. Domestic and Canada revenues were $708.2 million. Organic revenue when adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange and acquisitions decreased 0.2%. Organic revenue was adversely impacted by manufacturing and industrial services. The international revenues were $174.6 million. Organic revenue, when adjusted for foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures decreased 2.2%. Organic revenue was adversely impacted by the exiting of certain patient transportation contracts in manufacturing and industrial services. Acquisitions contributed $6.8 million of revenue in the quarter and divestitures reduced revenues by $9.9 million.", "Gross profit was $368 million or 41.7% of revenues. Adjusted SG&A, excluding amortization, was $192.2 million or 21.8% of revenues. Adjusted income from operations or EBITDA was $175.9 million or 19.9% of revenues. Net interest expense was $24.5 million. The as-reported tax rate for the quarter was 41.6% versus an adjusted tax rate of 36.9%. Net income attributable to Stericycle was $35.4 million or $0.41 on an as-reported basis and $1.10 when adjusted for acquisition-related expenses and other adjustments.", "Now, for the balance sheet, our covenant, debt to EBITDA ratio was 3.48 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of the revolver was approximately $712 million. In the quarter, we repurchased 145,000 shares of mandatory preferred convertible for $8.7 million. At the end of the quarter, we have authorization to purchase 2.7 million shares. Year-to-date as reported cash from operations was $392 million. When adjusted for recall reimbursement and other items, adjusted cash from operations was $462.1 million. Year-to-date CapEx was $91.7 million or 3.4% of revenues. Our DSO was 64 days. Finally, I would like to highlight that the company is in the process of renewing and extending its existing senior credit facility and term loans. We are capitalizing on current favorable debt markets and economic conditions. We appreciate the continued support from our banking partners and will provide further details when the financing is complete.", "I will now turn it over to Brent.", "Brent Arnold", "Thanks, Dan. This quarter, we closed 5 tuck-in acquisitions, including 4 in the U.S. and 1 internationally. These acquisitions contributed revenues of approximately $0.3 million in the quarter with projected annualized revenues of $3.1 million. Our worldwide acquisition pool remains robust with well over $100 million in annualized revenues in multiple geographies and lines of business.", "As Charlie mentioned earlier in the call, our Secure Information Destruction hospital-regulated waste and retail and healthcare hazardous waste services all had strong performance in the quarter. Small quantity healthcare and communication and related services performed in line with our expectations. Results in the quarter were adversely impacted by the weakness in the global manufacturing and industrial market, cost pressures in Latin America and several hurricanes. Starting with our regulated waste services, small quantity healthcare pricing pressures came in as expected. Our hospital sales team delivered another strong quarter driven by sales of Sharps Management, pharmaceutical waste and our new solution for controlled substance disposal.", "Our Secure Information Destruction service continued its organic revenue momentum, delivering 6.4% growth in the quarter. Our national accounts team signed 4 new accounts, all recognized leaders in their industries. Our integration of Shred-it and follow-on tuck-in acquisition remains on track. Our performance in the quarter was negatively impacted by the recent hurricanes in the Gulf Coast and Southeast regions. These storms temporarily closed many of our facilities and our customers\u2019 locations. Hurricane Maria shutdown our operations in Puerto Rico for several weeks and we are still working to return to normal operations. We also saw a decrease in revenues across our global manufacturing and industrial portfolio resulting from weakness in the market and unexpected delays of project work. In addition, Latin American cost savings initiatives that were anticipated to be completed in Q3 are now extending into 2018.", "In closing, we would like to thank all of our team members who supported the recovery efforts related to the natural disasters. Our team members did a remarkable job preparing and protecting our sites and works tirelessly to reroute and service our customers. And finally, we would like to thank everyone in the Stericycle family who donated time, money or guest to support their fellow team members impacted by the hurricanes.", "I will now turn it over to Charlie.", "Charlie Alutto", "Thanks, Brent. I would like to announce that we have revised our financial guidance policy. Consistent with industry peers and best practices, we will provide our full year 2018 financial guidance when we announced our fourth quarter results. This change will improve our visibility to the upcoming year prior to issuing initial guidance. The fundamentals of our markets remain strong. We are confident that we will continue to maintain and grow our business into the future. Although we are not giving detailed guidance for 2018, we anticipate that our 2018 results will be in line with our expected 2017 results.", "Now for our current guidance for the remainder of 2017, please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements and our guidance does not include future acquisitions, divestitures, integration and acquisition-related expenses and other adjusted items. For 2017, we believe EPS will be in the range of $4.46 to $4.52 using a share count of approximately $91 million. This includes the impact from current foreign exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures. We believe annual revenues for 2017 will be in the range of $3.54 billion to $3.6 billion using current foreign exchange rates.", "The worldwide revenue guidance for each of our service lines is: regulated waste and compliance services will be in the range of $2.01 billion to $2.03 billion, which includes the impact of the divested patient transport business. Secure Information Destruction services will be in the range of $820 million to $830 million. Communication and related services will be in the range of $370 million to $385 million depending on recall revenues. Manufacturing and industrial services will be in the range of $340 million to $360 million. We believe adjusted free cash flow in 2017 will be in the range of $450 million to $465 million. The 2017 CapEx is anticipated to be between $125 million to $145 million. We expect the 2017 full year adjusted tax rate to be at or slightly below 36.5%.", "Thank you for your time today. We will now answer your questions. Please keep in mind that we have many analysts who follow Stericycle. We ask that you limit yourself to a couple of questions. Sarah, you can now open the Q&A line?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ryan Daniels with William Blair.", "Ryan Daniels", "Thanks for taking the question. I know you want to reserve a lot of the conversation about the business transformation initiative till February, but curious if you can talk maybe specifically about the ERP, I know that\u2019s something that\u2019s been topic on a lot of investor minds for a while. And I guess there specifically regarding the cost and timing and how you come for it and then what you think the potential SG&A savings over time could look like from that specific initiative?", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes, Ryan, let me take that. I think on the ERP decision first and then we can talk about cost, but on the ERP decision, we went through a competitive selection process. We actually included second opinion validation that you have been going through this for a while and we identified a top tier software platform. We are now in the RFP process for the system integrator. So, when we think about cost, we are pleased with what believe will be the anticipated cost savings from the business transformation, but I think until the terms of the system integrator and as I said that\u2019s currently going through an RFP are finalized, we will not go into detail on cost yet. Again, we will talk about cost and savings on the February call. However, when you think about cost associated with business transformation, including ERP implementation, we are going to capture these as an adjusted item. This is consistent I think with best practices for handling such investments and provide transparency to our shareholders and the hold the management team accountable to the numbers that we give out in February.", "Ryan Daniels", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then Dan, can you just give us an EPS bridge between the prior and current guidance, I know there are some moving parts with the revenue, with FX, with the tax rate this quarter just the bridge is always helpful for us?", "Dan Ginnetti", "Yes. And I think Ryan, specifically you are asking about the revised guidance are you looking just specifically for the Q4 results?", "Ryan Daniels", "The revised guidance.", "Dan Ginnetti", "Okay.", "Ryan Daniels", "Or both if you want to offer it, I will take both, I am sure others would as well.", "Dan Ginnetti", "Sure. Let me take you through that. It will probably be easier if I first take you through the bridge to the current quarter, because that will have impact obviously in the Q4. So, when you think about Q4, the Street consensus was at $1.14 and our guidance was $1.13 to $1.19. The Q3 adjusted EPS came in at $1.10. EPS from operations fell short of street expectations by about $0.05 primarily due to the lower M&I volume, some higher costs in Latin America and the multiple hurricanes in the quarter. We had about $0.01 tax headwind that was more than offset by $0.02 of favorability of the repo or mandatory preferred convertible. So, that gets you to hit the current quarter. When you think about going forward, if you take the Q3 EBITDA miss, that was about $0.04 on the low end and $0.10 on the high end, so that gets factored into the go forward rate. We will add to that the repo, the $0.02 of repo that we got in Q3. The rest of these are impacts that we can carry forward into Q4.", "For M&I and the continuation of the weakness in the market, we see about $0.05 on the low end and $0.07 on the high end. If you saw the bridge that Charlie gave for the revenue, you saw that we tightened our regulated waste and compliance services revenue really taking the top end down, so that\u2019s really no change on the bottom end and about $0.02 off on the high end. We anticipate that the hurricane, both in Puerto Rico as well as the impacts in the Gulf Coast region to be potentially another $0.01 headwind going into Q4. Our international business with some revenue impacts in EMEA as well as those cost pressures we discussed in Latin America to be about $0.05 on the low end, $0.07 on the high end. As you have seen, paper prices have come down and so what we are simply doing is trimming a couple of pennies off the top end of the range as a result of the direction paper is going, so that no change in the bottom end and $0.02 on the top. To offset this, we have anywhere from $0.03 to $0.08 of favorability and that will come as a result of some improved benefit costs we are experiencing as well as rationalizing our bonus program to account for the change in our guidance. And then finally, we have about $0.01, the $0.02 favorability due to lower interest rates. So, what you are seeing is the ultimate change is about $0.09 on the bottom end and $0.17 on the top for a midpoint of $0.13.", "Ryan Daniels", "Okay, great. Thank you for all the color. I will hop back in the queue.", "Dan Ginnetti", "And just to add to that, so as you go into Q4, you would expect in the range of the $1.12 to $1.18.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sean Dodge with Jefferies.", "Sean Dodge", "Yes, good afternoon. Thanks. Charlie, maybe just going back to your comments on the initial outlook for \u201818 you may become that you expect the \u201818 results to be similar to 2017 without getting too far in the lead there, did you mean that growth trends that you are seeing in \u201817 you expect to carry into \u201818 or do you literally mean that you expect \u201818 range to be similar to the number you produced in \u201817?", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes. I think if you think about we are faced with probably a $40 million headwind on SQ that\u2019s our best estimate that hasn\u2019t for 2018. So, if you think about that headwind that we are facing that was known that we are going to face it. What I am saying that will be flat from an EPS perspective. I don\u2019t think there will be major changes, obviously some of the C&RS business, have some lumpiness with project and obviously M&I has some projects in it as well, but I am talking more about an EPS guidance flat \u201818 versus \u201817. Again, we have a headwind to make up on the pricing for SQ business, which remains about $40 million and it remains about $120 million to $130 million over this next 2.5 year period.", "Sean Dodge", "Okay, thanks. And then going back to the bridge for the quarter, Dan, could you sort of outsource the impact of the hurricanes alone I am sure it affected med waste, but I would imagine, it also had some impact on M&I as well. So, just back from the hurricanes maybe both revenue and EPS if you could?", "BrentArnold", "Hey, Sean, this is Brent. I\u2019ll go ahead and take that one. In the quarter, we had about a $0.02 impact with regard to the hurricane and that\u2019s a very conservative impact. As you can understand there are certain things that are easier for us to quantify, we went to where we \u2013we\u2019re unable to do that what\u2019s the normal revenue of those stocks, facilities that were closed and what\u2019s normal revenue or cost associated with those facilities on a daily basis. Those are lot more straightforward and it\u2019s important to get. The things that are more difficult are things like the time the team members spent preparing for the storms, team members that actually went to different districts to help out with the storms. So for instance our Northern Texas team all went to Southern Texas during Hurricane Harvey, really that was driven by the fact that most of our team members or many were impacted personally. So we needed to bring people in. So there\u2019s just a lot of moving parts not impossible to quantify, but difficult. So again $0.02 in the quarter, we think that\u2019s a conservative number and also I would just mention that we do feel when you heard that in Dan's bridge, we do feel another penny will also be an impact as we go into Q4. I think one of the thing that also that would makes it very difficult to quantify as we were experiencing the flooding and having to reroute or typical route around different routes to be able to get to the stocks as well as changing our routes and stores that are open and stores that aren\u2019t. And challenges that are capture \u2013 hard to capture that is that dollar amount, it did make routing very difficult in both of those areas.", "Sean Dodge", "Understood. Very helpful. Thank you.", "BrentArnold", "Thanks, Sean.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Thanks. Good evening. I will let take it outside the country for a moment. Could you elaborate on just the dynamic on Latin America? It sounds like some M&I projects pushed, but also just cost pressures, could you elaborate on each and then I am going to have a follow-up on patient transportation? Thanks.", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes, I will let Brent jump in on the M&I, because the M&I number, Scott, is a global number. So, we are seeing weakness in the M&I sector, not just in the U.S., but also in Latin America. The Latin America cost issues though are related to saving plans that were primarily related to our Brazil operations and are delayed due to permit issues. We got a plan that we were going to close several disposable plans, but convert them to transfer stations in Q3. Those would require from modifications and they are just taking longer than anticipated. Of course, these planned conversions also have related restructuring savings that didn\u2019t come to fruition, because of the delay in obtaining the permits. We will take this initiative like all other initiatives and push it into the business transformation, which also has some savings initiatives well above and beyond just the ERP implementation and those will move into our 2018 plan. On the M&I, I will let Brent kind of talk a little bit about the M&I volume reductions.", "BrentArnold", "Hey, Scott, Brent. You know what I will also just talk about M&I just globally if you don\u2019t mind, I am sure it\u2019s on a lot of people\u2019s minds. As we mentioned earlier came in below expectation again really driven by many factors Charlie start to hit on the fact that this is a global number and so you will have effects for industrial weakness in and outside of the U.S. especially in the markets where we participate. It was also driven by lower project volume overall and just lower project work and volume levels were down. Also destructions form hurricane, we\u2019ve talked a lot about that, but many of our facilities on the east side were closed, as a matter of fact, our Houston TSD was closed almost 10 days, so a significant impact on our business there. And it is a competitive market. So, we continue to face different pressures in the market. So, those are some of the key drivers that account for the M&I coming in below expectations. I think I would be remiss though if I didn\u2019t take a opportunity to step back and just reiterate that our M&I business is a component of our overall environmental solutions business. So, while we break M&I out to give that transparency and that visibility to the variability that the M&I business or revenue has is really part of our \u2013 it\u2019s one piece of a much larger business and that infrastructure associated with M&I really what helps us enable the growth of our retail waste, which is actually growing in high single-digits. Our hospital has this waste which is growing in low-teens. Some of our pharmaceutical waste program, which is another big growth initiative for us, some of our opioid or take-back programs also rely on some of that infrastructure. So, I think it\u2019s just important to keep in mind that while we are disappointed that M&I is below our expectations, there are some good external reasons for that, but the component in that infrastructure really enables a lot of our growth strategies and are key to overall success of Stericycle.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Okay, thanks for that and I got certainly at least two for one out of that one, but if I could follow-up with one more just on patient transportation you saw the divestiture impact in the quarter, could you just kind of give us the rehash on and I understand it\u2019s in guidance I think we are done this year. But just a rehash on it anything uncommon or is that following as planned?", "BrentArnold", "No, that came in as expected. There is two components to it, remember Scott, one was we divested certain assets and that had as we talked about in last call that had an $18 million impact to the second half of \u201817, it was up $36 million annualized business that was divested, so that $18 million obviously from a comparison standpoint $18 million in the second half of this year, $18 million first half of next year, nothing new there, but we still are managing a couple of variants that were not sold. And if you remember, we also exited some contracts. So, I think when you look at the international growth number, it\u2019s really important, it came in as a negative 2.2%, but if you exclude the patient transport exits of certain contracts and our M&I business probably had some fluctuations in it. That actually had an organic growth of about 1.5%. But as far as your question, was there anything out of the ordinary in the quarter for PTS, or patient transport services, no, it came in as expected and obviously we announced the divestiture on the last call.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Got it. Alright. Thanks, guys.", "BrentArnold", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel.", "Michael Hoffman", "Hi, thanks, Charlie and team. So, you have been on the road on many occasions, I have been with you on some of them, where you have talked about $150 million is sort of way to think about this ERP. Is there any change in that due?", "Charlie Alutto", "Obviously, I don\u2019t want to answer the cost question, Michael, because we are going through this RFP process and as you know the system integrator piece is the biggest piece of that puzzle, we want to get the best company in there that had experience in the implementation. So, I want to not get a comment on that. The only thing I would say is that this is going to be part of a broader business transformation initiative as we talked about process, improvements, restructurings that will happen, other projects above and beyond the ERP. So, again, so I want to get ahead of myself on giving a number at this point.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. So, if you are going to go through big business transformation, are we finally going to take businesses that are using up 80% of your time, but are contributing zero to negative and so divest of things that are not working for you, the money on the ERP in there?", "Charlie Alutto", "Absolutely, Michael. I think you made a very good point. We are going to go through this ERP implementation, which is a multiyear process and full implementation of the ERP really is 3 to 5 years and the first 2 years really is just focusing on design and blueprinting a lot of the backlog as functions that are common between all the businesses certainly before we implemented into a business or a country we want to make sure that, that\u2019s\u2019 going to be a long-term fit to the overall strategy at Stericycle. So, absolutely part of it is to continue to look at the portfolio of services in countries that we are in and we do need to make those decisions before we go through the expense of implementing that ERP in that service line or that business. Absolutely, we will be looking at that.", "Michael Hoffman", "And when do we learn about that?", "Charlie Alutto", "Well, I think we are a little premature now, because we are going to be obviously, we don\u2019t start implementing some of our businesses. Obviously, we are going to look at our core businesses first in 2019 and 2020, but as soon as we make the decisions around that and if we were to classify anything as assets held for sale, certainly we would disclose that and we would share that with our shareholders.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. If you pulled away the price compression that happened in the RMW business, could you share what the underlying domestic growth and the international growth organic growth was?", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes, let me take you through two segments, Michael. Good question. Let me take you through that. Obviously, the SQ pricing falls into the regulated waste and compliance revenues on the revenue table and if you look at that, you see a Q3 organic growth of a negative 1.9% and remember going into this year, we said that category was either going to be flat or down a little bit, so that came in as anticipated. But if you exclude the patient transport contract data, which we talked about on a question earlier and you criticized the SQ pricing issue, we actually grew that segment by 4.1%, which really reiterates what Brent and I have said before, we had really strong growth. So what has contributed to that? What contributed to that is certainly retail has wasted in that number that\u2019s growing at a high single-digit. Healthcare hazardous waste growth growing in the low-teens that control substances in some of the opioid take-backs contributed to that growth. So the underlying part of our business unfortunately it doesn\u2019t show up on that number, because of the SQ issue. Again, it\u2019s grown by about 4.1% for the quarter. Also on the international, the other thing at international let me reiterate that again, because I think I answered that earlier, but I\u2019ll take you through that. The organic growth rate for the quarter was a negative 2.2%, but it\u2019s again you exclude the patient transportation exiting of contract and M&I, which we know fluctuates and had a disappointing quarter. We actually had an organic growth of around 1.5% or a total growth around 2.7%.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. On that one\u2026", "Charlie Alutto", "Is that helpful?", "Michael Hoffman", "Yes, very helpful. And you have got a mixture of paper and medical and the remainder of that international, so did something\u2026", "Charlie Alutto", "No, Michael the paper actually would fall into the Secure Information Destruction service at the end of that.", "Michael Hoffman", "No. I mean, paper meaning your Secure Information \u2013 sorry, so the document \u2013 there is document, international document destruction is that part of that number, that 15?", "Charlie Alutto", "It\u2019s in the \u2013 it would be in the overall international number that you are looking at, but that gets observed if you specifically looked at the regulated waste and then the Secure Information Destruction worldwide number, the paper would be in that number, when you look at the international, that does include that in there.", "Michael Hoffman", "Alright. I have asked the question clumsily and I apologize, the data you just gave me the international 1.5% growth, is that all international or just RMW International?", "Charlie Alutto", "All international. And then the different service lines includes the global revenues for all those service lines, I\u2019m sorry to cut you off, Michael.", "Michael Hoffman", "Yes, that\u2019s alright. So where I was going is your \u2013 I think your RMW International business had been trending to the middle of the year 3% or 4% in a constant currency basis, are you still looking at that kind of number in the RMW part of that?", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes, I don\u2019t want to breakout a lot to look at up by the end of the call try to get back to you on that.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. When the recalls, there is a big headwind in 4Q, right, we got to remember that, that\u2019s something everybody should be paying attention to?", "Charlie Alutto", "Absolutely. Last year was a record year C&RS driven by one very large recall that in Q4. We are on track to match that this year without that one big event and had no carryover to 2017, but you are right we have a big comparison in Q4 of \u201817 versus Q4 of \u201816 that\u2019s correct.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. And then what were the dollar sales of paper in 3Q?", "Charlie Alutto", "If you look at paper, what are the dollar sales, you mean the gross revenue from paper?", "Michael Hoffman", "Yes, it\u2019s in total document destruction number, I am trying to understand what the sequential decline is going to be?", "Dan Ginnetti", "Yes, Michael, I think \u2013 in the organic growth rate of our Secure Information Destruction, it was about 1% of that 6.4% growth.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay, alright. Last question for me, I know I have run over the numbers, but if you put those things impresses you on anything given all of the misses is the free cash flow number. So, you are telling you are going to do $80 million to $95 million in free cash flow on the fourth quarter?", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes, Michael, we are very pleased with our continued focus on cash flow and more importantly the flow-through of it. If you think about it and I know even when you look at the income from operations year-over-year being down, the year-over-year cash flow is much better than that and so what you see that is being able to convert, obviously it found less cash tax that you have to pay as a result of it, but really improved flow-through. So we\u2019re pleased with our cash flow generation based on our results.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Charlie Alutto", "Thanks, Michael.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Gary Bisbee with RBC.", "Gary Bisbee", "Hi, guys. Good afternoon.", "Charlie Alutto", "Hi, Gary.", "Gary Bisbee", "The first question, Charlie, as you discussed the business transformation project there are lot of things you cited in addition to the ERP. And I guess I wanted to just ask about the genesis of this. Did this start with or come out of that consultant that you hired a year ago, have you been working on this for a long time and just getting to the point where you are getting ready to start talking about it or is this more reaction that more needs to be done. I am just trying to understand what got you to this point of talking about this?", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes, I think the genesis was we brought in some talent. I think we talked about out that around over a year ago to look at our systems. And we knew that we are operating far too many systems and internally we struggled with the fact that we have done a good job of integrating acquisitions into a service line, Gary, but not necessarily into the broader Stericycle. So, we have known we have had challenges of integrating into and fully leverage our size and scale. And as we went through what is best in class, as we went through how can we transform the company not only from a system standpoint, you start looking at business processes, you start looking at organizational structure, so this has been a journey it is something we have looked at for the last year. Obviously, you don\u2019t take this decision lightly, it is obviously a big initiative. I think we are up for the challenge, but as we looked at it, got a second opinion, that\u2019s really the genesis of how we came to the decision at this time both on an ERP system and on the process improvements we think we can make the restructuring that we think we can do and some of the related procurement activities that we think can overall drive a better operation at Stericycle and obviously improve our profitability.", "Dan Ginnetti", "Just to add to that, one of the things that\u2019s so important is to take this time prior to the implementation of an ERP really aligns our organizational structure and our processes not only does it create some opportunity to create efficiencies in advance of that, but it really highly increases the likelihood of having a very successful implementation by preparing the organization in advance not only led to a broader context of business transformation leading to work up to and then including the ERP implementation.", "Gary Bisbee", "Okay. That makes a lot of sense. Do you guys feel like you have the right team at the company or are there areas we are going to need more talent to deliver on what sounds like a significant amount of effort here?", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes, I think it\u2019s a combination of both. I think we certainly over the course of the last year, we have supplemented our IP team with a group of professionals that have a proven track record of an ERP implementation. We have gone outside. We have realized there are some things that we may were out as good as we are looking at a broad organization or process improvements. We have aligned with the top tier consulting company to help us on that journey. And then really from the education I think we have all been through an executive team, it comes down to system integrator, right. There is a lot of different technologies you can put out there. They are all very good. There are some that you feel are better fit to your organization, but the integration is the one whereas the rubber hits the road and we haven\u2019t got it yet, we are on the middle of an RFP again as the bigger expense item. That\u2019s why we are going to wait on talking about cost after we have negotiated that agreement, but we are going to align ourselves with a top tier system integrator. We want to make sure that this is going to be successful. This is the future of Stericycle. I think we are going to be in really good shape 3 to 5 years from now, much more. We have always been lean, but we are going to be more operationally efficient now. So, it\u2019s a combination of inside talent and getting help from the outside as well.", "Gary Bisbee", "Okay, great. And then just the last one from me, I hear all your comments on the M&I business, but we have seen you as really global industrial activity pickup pretty strongly. I know there was a lag on the way down, but it strikes me that you should be seeing some lift from that. Is there anything specific to your business that would make that not come back as industrial activity improves in the U.S. or is it something just something to do with the end markets? Thank you.", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes, I think it\u2019s a combination of both. I think when you look at our total business overall with M&I, we grew 2.2% year-to-date. And I think if you compare us to other companies out there that might be a little bit below them, but certainly it\u2019s not like the overall hazardous waste business is not doing well, obviously we are focused where we think we bring a lot of value to customers, right, retail has waste, healthcare has waste. The other thing that gets lost in this is that we have actually improved profitability in this business. We talk about last year remember we were thinking about potentially divesting, but we saw there is opportunities for profitability improvement and that business as a whole you saw, because we run, obviously we share a lot of those resources across all the different hazardous waste on service lines actually had an improvement about 140 basis points year-over-year. Now, the M&I miss, yes, I think we are trailing the market a little bit, it is a very competitive marketplace. We are in a niche player in M&I when you compare us to others. We are trying to be disciplined on the work we go after. Our focus is again on retail and healthcare has waste. And I think Brent talked about it really the reason we got into this business and we made these acquisitions and build the operational structure was not to go after the M&I business. We call it out now, because it does fluctuate. Our focus is on retail and healthcare has and I think we have proven that we have done really well on those markets and that\u2019s why when you look at it, RW, our regulated waste and compliance revenues excluding setting aside the SQ and the PTS were growing by 4.1% because of that. So a long way to answer your question, but hopefully I answered for you.", "Dan Ginnetti", "Yes, just to add to that, as you recall and I think Charlie did a great job highlighting that the differences is that back when the M&I kind of retraction in that market began Stericycle lagged that for a couple of quarters. And so it\u2019s not a complete surprise to us that if there is significant rebound, because of our niche orientation that we may lag on the way back up.", "Gary Bisbee", "I appreciate all the commentary. Thank you.", "Charlie Alutto", "Thanks, Gary. Sarah, anymore questions? Sarah?", "Operator", "I am sorry. Your next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital.", "Hamzah Mazari", "Good afternoon. The first question is just a clarification, are you giving 2018 guidance or did you guys call 2018 as being flagged, I recall you said you are not giving guidance, but then maybe you may have referenced something on 2018?", "Dan Ginnetti", "Yes, let me take that, Hamzah. First of all, as you know, the starts that we have giving guidance on this call, but obviously wanted to be consistent with industry peers and best practice standards. So, we are not to give guidance initial guidance until our Q4 results. Obviously, we will get improved visibility into the coming year because we will have Q4 and we will have January results. We will have greater visibility to our SQ pricing at that time and the business transformation savings and costs. So, those will have an impact on 2018. So, we are not giving official guidance. What you maybe jumped on the call and heard is that just directionally we think our end markets are strong, we are going to maintain and grow the business in the long-term and we feel at this point at a very, very high level from an earnings perspective anticipate that our \u201818 earnings will be flat versus \u201817. Again, we are going to get a lot more detailed guidance on the Q4 call in February.", "Hamzah Mazari", "Okay. And then any \u2013 you talked about the M&I business, but one of your competitors had flagged just U.S. chemical industrial customers asking for bigger discounts. Are you seeing pricing pressure in the M&I business, just curious because I know the earlier question asked about disconnect with global industrial activity and so any color there?", "Dan Ginnetti", "Yes, I think any time you want to characterize market is competitive like we have, it\u2019s certainly is a competitive market and I think pricing comes in a play, when you\u2019re talking about these projects. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s got any worse over the last 3 to 6 months not really, I don\u2019t think so, but it is, it remains a very competitive marketplace.", "Hamzah Mazari", "Okay. And just last question, I\u2019ll turn it over. Do \u2013 should investors be thinking about any positive, negative on that neutral impact from Amazon getting into drug distribution, I don\u2019t know how big your pharmacy business is, but is that a meaningful impact or should we just be ignoring that as it relates to Stericycle? Thanks.", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes, I think it was no matter who distributes the pharmaceuticals, eventually, if I think I returned or where the distribution location takes place, they would have lost or damaged material that we would have to service. I don\u2019t think right now any material impact whether they come into the drug space or not, I don\u2019t want to comment on a particular potential customer, but I don\u2019t think it really has a material impact on our pharma waste business Hamzah. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kevin Steinke with Barrington Research.", "Kevin Steinke", "Hi, so you did revise two of the service lines favorably Secure Information Destruction, it looks like the bottom end of guidance came up by 25 million that the top end by 5 million and then communication and related services the bottom end I believe came up by 15 million in terms of the revenue outlook. So just could you talk about what\u2019s driving the changes in both of those two outlooks?", "Charlie Alutto", "Sure. When I think when you look at our C&RS business, the $50 million really was a reflection of a strong year-to-date number. We\u2019ve done really well, as we talked about and recalled automotive continues to do well for us, so we feel comfortable. As you know Kevin, you have followed us for a long time, when we called out, recall and returns, obviously as you go to Q4, you just have more visibility. You have three quarters done already. So, you can narrow the range and feel more comfortable about it. It\u2019s still an unpredictable business, but certainly we feel good about it going into the last quarter. And on the Shred-it, on the Secure Information Destruction revenue line, again solid three quarters in a row. So, we feel good about that business again, newer service line for us, so we are trying to get comfortable with that business before we bring guidance up, but certainly three strong quarters more fine tuning and that one going up and bottom end and the top end of the range.", "Dan Ginnetti", "And just to add to that just in the overall changes to our range is remember we set some favorability in foreign exchange is built into those numbers across all four of those revenue streams, it\u2019s about $8 million in foreign exchange and about $1 million due to the impact of acquisitions.", "Kevin Steinke", "Okay. Did you make any Secure Information Destruction acquisitions in the quarter or what was the composition of those tuck-in deals you did?", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes. I would classify all the deals in the quarter as tuck-in small tuck-in deals. We did 4 in the U.S. and 1 international and they were all in the Secure Information Destruction space.", "Kevin Steinke", "Okay, perfect. Just one last one here for me. So, October \u201817 you had the 8-K announcing you had entered the settlement for the class action with the plaintiffs and their counsel and it looks like the next step is preliminary court approval of this settlement. So, I don\u2019t know if you have gotten anymore insight into the timing of the court schedule or if that\u2019s still kind of up in the air?", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes. Actually, the court granted the preliminary approval of the settlement at the end of October, so right after the agreement was struck. Members of the settlement class will receive notification probably sometime, Kevin, late November through December and that time as you know class members have an opportunity to opt out or object to the settlement. And a final fairness hearing has been scheduled for February 23 just a little caution on that, that time would be the best case scenario. It doesn\u2019t factor in a time for an appeal and if there is an appeal certainly it can push out that final fairness hearing and the final approval for several months or even a year from that February 23rd date.", "Kevin Steinke", "Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for taking the questions.", "Charlie Alutto", "Thanks, Kevin. Have a great day.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from our Barbara Noverini with Morningstar.", "Barbara Noverini", "Hi, guys. Good afternoon.", "Charlie Alutto", "Hello Barbara.", "Barbara Noverini", "So another thing that kind of struck me about the quarter was that gross and EBITDA margins actually held up pretty well sequentially given the revenue challenges in the quarter. So, is this primarily because M&I was so weak and that\u2019s a really low margin business for you or were there some other business lines that performed a little bit better than you expected in the quarter?", "Dan Ginnetti", "I think Barbara when you are looking at the EBITDA margins, certainly as you described it some of the shortfalls, remember a big impact of that is the $14 million and revenue shortfall and that kind of flows through. And as you indicated that some of those that flow through at less margins and then we had the impact of the Hurricane included partly to offset that though we did have some benefit from the C&RS business. They have about 21 basis points of better improvement or better flow-through and profitability at what they had and then we saw some favorability in the benefits, but also based off the results, we did rationalize our bonus approvals to get in the range of states the current performance of the company.", "Barbara Noverini", "Got it. Okay, thanks. And then just quickly you mentioned your success at cross-selling services to hospital customers and that seems to be ongoing. Historically, this has been a pretty steady category for you gross margin wise. So, I am just curious if your success in layering multiple services on to these hospital customers, these LQ customers is actually translating into some margin expansion from that business?", "Brent Arnold", "Yes, Barbara, this is Brent. I will take that one. Yes, I would definitely say that\u2019s the case. It is difficult at times to break it out right, because our operations support both our LQ and our SQ business, but I would tell you based off what we are seeing with regard to expanding our services, each of the new services that we rollout we tend to be able to improve the overall margin, some of that is just because we already have resources in place. So, if you have a Sharps account, also now that technician can be leveraged to you to collect the RX waste. That same technician can be used to change out the CSRX of the controlled substance container. So, a lot of that is just based off the fact that we are already going to those places and enables us to bring on additional services at better margin.", "Barbara Noverini", "Okay, that\u2019s great. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.", "HenryChen", "Hi good afternoon guys. It\u2019s Henry Chen calling for Jeff. Hey, guys. Just a question on the regulated waste and compliance services side, I know you mentioned that organic growth excluding the transport and the SQ pricing headwind improved and you called out some of the retail impact or the growth from that business, just curious if you could provide more color on the core regulated medical business and if you are seeing an improvement there where that\u2019s coming from and what\u2019s driving that? Thanks.", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes. I think certainly on the core regulated med waste business, I think that\u2019s what you are referring to, Henry. Obviously, we have got challenges on the SQ side of the business and that headwind of $40 million is obviously impacting a negative 1.9%, but as Brent has alluded to and I think the question that Barb was right on is we have been really successful on the hospital side of the business and we highlighted on the call, we continue to sell Sharps management pharmaceutical waste, our controlled substances is being really well received in the marketplace. That LQ business is growing by about 4% to 5%, which historically is a great number at Stericycle and we sort of report on LQ, SQ, that was certainly a good number for us. So, I am giving you the U.S. number on that regulated waste, so that obviously is a 80% of our market. So, we continue to do really well on the hospital side. Obviously, the SQ pricing impacts came in as expected for the quarter. There was no big surprise there. We haven\u2019t seen an increase in calls or discounts. So, we are pleased with that result as well.", "HenryChen", "Got it, okay. Yes, that is helpful. And in that business, are you \u2013 have you been consolidating any of your routes or divesting any of the businesses there?", "Charlie Alutto", "In the medical waste side of the business.", "HenryChen", "Medical waste side, yes, okay.", "Charlie Alutto", "No, absolutely not.", "HenryChen", "Got it. Okay, great. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro", "Good afternoon, guys. Thanks. There has been a lot of talk about various guidance assumptions, but I wasn\u2019t clear, why did your guidance for regulated waste for the year comes down, if you could just maybe simplify that specific logic point?", "Dan Ginnetti", "Yes, absolutely. So, if you look at where we are trending for the quarter and as we took the opportunity in the fourth quarter to really narrow our ranges, we have been operating to the mid to the low end of the range. So, when you see the adjustments that we did by bringing up the bottom or bringing your top-down to 20 which you are really seeing is just an adjustment only the top end of the range, but no change to the bottom end of the range. It\u2019s just a result of tightening of ranges.", "Isaac Ro", "I understand that. But the midpoint is lower and so I am wondering, is something changing your pricing assumption or are there another dynamic here that\u2019s new in the fundamentals of the business?", "Charlie Alutto", "Yes, I think that would be in Latin American and Europe. And I think this is Charlie, I think Dan kind of spoke about it when you gave the bridge with respect to Q4 there is some softness in the growth in international, specifically Latin America. So, certainly that has an impact on it, because that falls into RWCS regulated waste and compliance revenue table as well.", "Isaac Ro", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. So, if Latin America was tracking better, you have heard us say your guidance would have been unchanged otherwise?", "Charlie Alutto", "I think there was slight weakness in EMEA, which is our European and emerging markets on Asian market, but primarily it was Latin America. I don\u2019t know if it would have been all mitigated by that, I think a good portion of it though would have, yes.", "Isaac Ro", "Okay, fair enough. Thank you.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions. Do you have any closing remarks?", "Charlie Alutto", "I do, Sarah. Thank you so much. In closing, I would like to share that Stericycle has partnered with a National Safety Council on a public education campaign against prescription drug abuse. The campaign will feature a traveling memorial to the victims of the opioid crisis which will visit select cities over the next 6 months. The campaign memorial opens tomorrow in Chicago. We are please to be part of this important educational campaign. The campaign and the memorial will feature Stericycle\u2019s seal and send medication mail bag envelopes. Our support of this campaign reinforces our commitment to provide safe solutions for the disposal of unused pharmaceuticals.

Good afternoon and thank you for joining Stericycle's fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. On the call today are Charlie Alutto, Chief Executive Officer; Dan Ginnetti, Chief Financial Officer; and Brent Arnold, Chief Operating Officer.", "The discussion during today's call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ significantly from those described in such forward-looking statements. Other factors that could cause the actual results to differ are discussed in the Safe Harbor statements in our earnings press release and in greater detail in Stericycle's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.", "Past performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results or trends. To the extent permitted under applicable loss we make no commitment to disclose any subsequent revisions to forward-looking statements.", "On the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures.

Also as a result of feedback from our shareholders and in an effort to increase transparency, you will see and hear additional disclosures on our financial and operational performance both this afternoon and going forward.", "Now turning to today's discussion on Slide 3, first it is important to review our leadership position, our vision, and our long-term opportunities. Today Stericycle is a leader in multiple large and fragmented markets. The markets we serve continue to grow, driven by increasing regulations, but focus on sustainability solutions, the ageing population, and our customers desire to outsource services to focus on their core businesses.", "We also have long-term customer relationships on multi-year agreements and continue to identify cross-selling opportunities. The strength of our service lines in markets combined with the actions we are taking to strengthen our organization will accelerate our penetration in a growing $38 billion global market and position the Company for long-term growth and improved financial performance.", "So with that as a backdrop, let's review our agenda for today's call. We will first discuss our strategy and the business transformation, Brent will highlight our performance by service line, and Dan will review our Q4 and full-year results, and finally, Dan and I will review our 2018 outlook.", "Now let's start with Slide 6 and the Business Transformation. As I introduced on the last earnings call, we are undertaking a comprehensive company-wide business transformation to strengthen our business and position Stericycle for continued success for many years to come. We recognized there is a clear need for change, nearly 500 acquisitions over 25 years has resulted in more than 450 business applications and over 65 financial systems.", "There are certainly opportunities to drive synergies, improve processes, and reduce redundancies. In addition competitive pressure, including pricing remains a challenge. We know that the performance of our non-core assets has been inconsistent and that we must enhanced our control and compliance effort. Since our last call, we have also identified additional strategies and investments for the long-term health of the business, which will have an unfavorable impact on our 2018 guidance.", "In all, we've determined our operating model needs to be reconfigured to more effectively manage the business and enhance the return to shareholders in the future. The business transformation is focused on a clear vision to build best-in-class performance management model as outlined on Slide 7. We expect this will enable us to deliver an enhanced customer experience and greater value for shareholders through predictable profit growth, stable compounded revenue growth of 3% to 5%, and adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 10% over the next five years.", "To carry out this transformation, we conducted comprehensive research and due diligence and hired leading consultants to help us with a diagnostic assessment of the business. Through this process, we identified a number of strategic improvement opportunities. To execute against these, we've established dedicated project teams and upgraded an internal talent to help with oversight and ensure success. And to drive accountability, we have developed detailed work plans and metrics to track our progress.", "Slide 8 provides an overview of the key initiatives of this business transformation to help you understand the full scope and magnitude of the effort. We will be implementing a global enterprise performance management operating model. This new operating model is expected to standardize global end-to-end processes, align the Company around key performance indicators, and improve data management, and decision making.", "A global enterprise resource planning system is the central component of our business transformation and will become the backbone of our performance management model. Within ERP, we will integrate all of our service lines and geographies on to one operating system. The five key initiatives of the business transformation include portfolio rationalization, operational optimization, organizational excellence and efficiency, commercial excellence and strategic sourcing.", "First, we are evaluating a portfolio to rationalize non-core assets. Second, we are improving our operations by standardizing our route logistics, modernizing field operations and driving network efficiency across facilities. Third, to achieve operational excellence and efficiency where optimizing our organizational structure, which began in November.", "Furthermore, we will be aligning our structure around the global to share business services model. Fourth, to achieve commercial excellence, we are aligning our sales and service functions around the customer, we are standardizing our customer relationship management processes and expanding customer self-service options.", "And finally we are implementing global procure-to-pay processes and improving demand management. We expect these initiatives will drive efficiency and enable Stericycle to better capitalize on growth opportunities with improved financial performance.", "In addition to the significant operational benefits, we are focused on ensuring that the business transformation delivers an appropriate return to shareholders. As we scene on Slide 9, we expect the business transformation will deliver an IRR greater than 85% are against our projected one time program investments of $275 million to $300 million. As a result of near-term initiatives in 2018 we expect initial adjusted EBITDA benefits in the range of $60 million to $65 million, which will partially offset our current business challenges.", "We expect cumulative adjusted EBITDA benefits of $850 million to $1 billion between 2018 and 2022. The business transformation is expected to deliver strong bottom line grow. Over the next five years, we expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA on a compound annual growth rate of approximately 5% to 9% and an EPS compound annual growth rate of 6% to 10%.", "Over the same period, we anticipate generating substantial free cash equivalent to a compound annual growth rate of approximately 10% to 14%. This cash flow will provide additional leverage to create value for shareholders.", "Slide 10, reviews our anticipating milestones for the business transformation and the timing of the financial returns. To-date we've made good progress on the early phases of the transformation. In 2018 we will focus on executing near-term efficiency initiatives, making the necessary investments to ensure success and finding a blueprint that will deliver our target operating model.", "In 2018 we intend to build and test the enterprise resource planning system and related enterprise performance management system. In 2020 we intend to rollout the ERP in the U.S. with the four and internationally beginning in 2021. We anticipate realizing the full value of the transformation in 2022 and beyond.", "Our investments in the transformation are weighed heavily in the first two years, primarily due to the upfront investment in the ERP system. We are executing on some near-term initiatives to drive adjusted EBITDA savings in 2018 and 2019 and will begin to realize the vast majority of the financial benefits in 2020 and beyond. This is truly a transformational effort to redefine as Stericycle operates.", "Now on Slide 11, we're also conducting a thorough review of all of our service and geographies to determine their long-term fit within our organization and rationalize our portfolio. Our assessment includes screening for financial criteria such as long-term growth, return on investment capital and margin improvement.", "We will also look at strategic criteria including alignment with our business model and core competencies ability to leverage our infrastructure our customer base for growth, potential impact the current services and implications for the ERP implementation.", "Over the past 18 months, we applied some of these criteria to make a number of portfolio decisions. This included the divestiture of the manufacturing and industrial asset in the UK, the exit of our UK patient transport business and most recently the divestiture of our Secure Information Destruction business in South Africa. We will evaluate future potential divestitures to enable us to be more strategically focused and better position for continued growth and improve profitability.", "Turning to Slide 12. The ERP system will enable us to further strengthen company-wide controls and compliments ongoing compliance efforts. We have expanded our compliance legal, financial, and audit teams to strengthen our overall compliance program. We are also instituting new policies and procedures as well of increasing internal monitoring programs.", "The standardization of our information technology platforms that will come with the ERP implementation will further strengthen controls and support our compliance program. You will see the results of some of these efforts in our financial results today and in our periodic filings which include enhance disclosures.", "That concludes my overview of the business transformation. Brent will now discuss our Q4 revenues and performance by business line.", "Brent Arnold", "Thanks Charlie. Turning to Slide 14, total revenues for the fourth quarter were $887.8 million, down 2.1% from $906.4 million in Q4 2016. When adjusted for manufacturing and industrial revenues decreased 1.6%. Acquisitions contributed $6.8 million to revenues and divestitures reduced revenues by $10.2 million. Growth was also unfavorably impacted in the quarter by a challenging comparison due to a record event in our communication and related services business in Q4 2016.", "Revenues from each of our service lines in the fourth quarter were as follows: Regulated Waste and Compliance Services $497.7 million; Secure Information Destruction Services $202.2 million; Communication and Related Services $97.2 million; and Manufacturing Industrial Services $90.7 million. This quarter we closed six tuck-in acquisitions including five in the U.S. and one internationally. These acquisitions contributed revenues of approximately $1 million in the quarter with projected annualized revenues of $9.7 million.", "In alignment with our portfolio optimization strategy we divest a Secure Information Destruction business in South Africa. The divesture reduced revenues in the quarter by $300 dollars it was an annualized impact of $3.5 million. As expected Regulated Waste and Compliance Services revenue was down year-over-year. This was partly due to the previously announced patient transportation access and divestiture. This result included strong growth in both retail hazardous waste and additional services to hospitals.", "Secure Information Destruction services continues to perform well, we had a record number of new installations among our national and regional accounts in the quarter. Organic revenue growth in the quarter was 5.5% and 6.1% net of paper. Communications and Related Services also had a strong quarter with continued execution of recall events. However, it was down on a year-over-year basis given the comparison to our record quarter in the same period last year. As expected Manufacturing and Industrial Services was down when compared to the same period last year.", "I will now hand it over to Dan, who will discuss our financial performance for the fourth quarter and greater detail.", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Thanks Brent. Turning to Slide 16, for our key financial performance. As Brent discussed quarterly revenues were in line at $887.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $151.5 million results fell short of our expectations due to the following factors. We incurred approximately $7 million in higher than expected costs. We recorded accounting adjustments of approximately $7 million.", "These adjustments are primarily related to our progress on internal control remediation efforts and are not expected to repeat. And we recorded a non-cash depreciation and fixed assets expense of $18.5 million the majority of which will not repeat. This resulted in an adjusted EPS of $1 including some international tax their ability. GAAP EPS was $0.97.", "This includes the favorable impact of $1.52 from the federal tax reform offset in part by non-cash goodwill impairment charge in Latin America as part of our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter and other adjusting items. Adjusted cash flow from operations was $165 million due in part to stronger collections and favorability related to timing of accruals.", "For additional color on EPS, let me take you through a few details on Slide 17. Street consensus for EPS was at $1.14. EPS from operations was equivalent to a $1.09 or short of street consensus by $0.05. This was primarily due to higher costs in Europe, including the last of some stranded costs from the patient transport business.", "In addition, our U.S. regulated waste and compliance services business saw increased costs related to the installation of a new large LQ contract, some higher fuel in energy, and a shift in the expected mix of LQ and SQ growth. This was partially offset by a strong quarter in C&RS.", "In the quarter, there were some non-operational expenses, including $0.14 of catch up and acceleration of non-cash related depreciation, $0.04 from control remediation and policy harmonization offset by $0.09 of favorability in interest in tax not related to U.S. tax reform. Q4 adjusted EPS came in at a $1.", "Slide 18 covers our full-year 2017 results. Now for the balance sheet on Slide 19. Our covenant debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.66 at the end of the quarter. The unused portion of the revolver was approximately $597.5 million. In the quarter, we repurchased 65,000 shares of the mandatory preferred convertible for $3.4 million. At the end of the quarter, we have authorization to purchase an additional 2.7 million shares. For the year, cash from operations was $508.6 million and when adjusted for recall reimbursement and other items, cash from operations was $625.5 million, CapEx was $143 million or 4% of revenues, and our DSO was 63 days.", "As I mentioned, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 3.66. The company's credit facilities containing number of covenants, including financial covenants to which the company was in compliance at December 31, 2017. Based upon the company's expected 2018 business transformation investment plan, it is reasonably possible that the company could exceed a debt-to-EBITDA leverage threshold at some point in 2018. This risk can be mitigated through appropriate spending controls and/or seeking temporary relief from the leverage covenants from our lenders.", "We have a strong relationship with our lenders, who have been supportive of the company in the past. We have approached our lead arrangers and believe there are fair options that will enable us to continue to invest in the future of Stericycle.", "I will now hand it over to Charlie for to go over our 2018 outlook.", "Charles Alutto", "Thanks Dan. Now for our guidance for 2018 on Slide 21. Please keep in mind that these are forward-looking statements, our guidance does not include future acquisitions or divestitures and it is based on currently known items. For the 2018 outlook, we will be focusing on operational result and EBITDA. This metric is more commonly used, better aligned with our covenants and as a proxy for cash flow. Based on feedback from our shareholders, we will only be providing guidance for our cash from operations and free cash flow on an as reported basis.", "Based on the current business environment, we believe annual revenue for 2018 will be in the range of $3.48 billion to $3.63 billion using current foreign exchange rates. The worldwide revenue guidance for each of our service lines is regulated waste and compliance services will be in the range of $1.92 billion to $1.97 billion.", "Secure Information Destruction Services will be in the range of $870 million to $910 million. Communication and Related Services will be in the range of $355 million to $385 million depending on recall revenues. Manufacturing and Industrial Services will be in the range of $335 million to $365 million.", "We believe adjusted EBITDA will be in the range of $760 million to $810 million. We expect adjusted EPS will be in a range of $4.45 to $4.85 using a share count of $9.5 million reflective of the conversion of preferred shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 26% to 26.5%.", "We believe cash from operations will be in the range of $510 million to $560 million. We expect CapEx will be between $160 million to $180 million and free cash flow up $330 million to $400 million. Slide 22 provides an overview of our assumptions for the 2018 guidance.", "I'll now turn it back to Dan.", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Thank you. On Slide 23 provides the bridge from the directional guidance revealed on the Q3 2017 call. We had anticipated the 2017 EBITDA results would be approximately $835 million and the 2018 would be generally flat. Let me highlight what has changed since the last call.", "First our Q4 results did not command have anticipated and approximately $5 million of debt expense will continue in 2018. Next we expect any impact of $25 million related to a revised long-term commercial strategy focused on strengthening our relationships, our SQ relationships. We will make a $10 million investment in our IP infrastructure to stabilize our legacy IT environment and prepare for future ERP implementation.", "Lastly, with the completion of our 2018 detailed implementation part business plan for our business transformation. We have refined the timeline of recognized savings, which resulted in a shift of $10 million into future years.", "As I've highlighted on Slide 24, we expect the tax rate in the range of 26% to 26.5% as a result of the recent tax reform. We anticipate this will have an adjusted EPS benefit in the range of $0.55 to $0.65, which is already incorporated into our guidance and will benefit cash from operations by $20 million to $25 million. We intend to utilize this cash in support of our ongoing capital allocation priorities.", "Turning to Slide 25, we will continue to maintain a disciplined approach to our capital allocation strategy. Our approach allows for debt reduction and share repurchases as well as tuck in acquisitions that expand our route density and operational throughput. Long-term, we expect our continued strong free cash flow will provide additional levers to enhance shareholder value.", "I will now turn it back to Charlie for final remarks before we open it up for Q&A.", "Charles Alutto", "Thanks, Dan. I want to reiterate that the entire Stericycle team is committed to our business transformation and improving our long-term financial performance and transformational enable Stericycle to enhanced our customer experience, Drive Operational Efficiencies and improve shareholder returns. We look forward providing updates on our progress on future earnings calls.", "We'll now answer your questions. Jesse, please open the line for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open.", "Ryan Daniels", "Yes, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Let me start with one, on the $25 million EBITDA hit to initial expectations for the long-term SQ strategy. Can you talk a little bit more about what that $25 million investment is? Is that kind of a marketing front? Is it changing your pricing structure? Just any color there, because that's pretty big gap?", "Brent Arnold", "Hey, Ryan. This is Brent. I'll take that one. Really the long-term SQ strategy is really based on the work that we've done with our data analytics team and multiple pilots that we've completed over the last I would say we're five quarters. With that we've had some key learnings in the business and we'll be rolling out three initiatives focused on strengthening our customer relationships as well as improving our long-term.", "Of the three initiatives the first being we're going to reduce or limit our annual price increase with specific customer segments in an effort to reduce our churn and long-term discounting. But we're also going to be expanding the number of customers with a dedicated account manager and really those account managers will serve as the single point of contact for those customers for Stericycle.", "And then finally, we're going to be making some additional marketing investments to promote our brand in the marketplace. While all these investments are initiatives come with an impact the near-term results we are confident they will help strengthen our relationships and improve the long-term performance of our business.", "Ryan Daniels", "Okay. Thanks for that. And then as my follow-up just looking at the anticipated $60 million to $65 million in adjusted EBITDA benefits in 2018, it's a pretty good chunk of the overall EBITDA about 8%. How visible at this point in the year are those benefits based on what you've already done and how much is kind of still out there we're going to have to continue to monitor that going forward to ensure that you can achieve those results? Thanks.", "Charles Alutto", "Yes, Ryan, great question. We do have a line of sight on the entire $60 million to $65 million we have dedicated teams and work streams associated with all that some of that has been accomplished through the organizational excellence and restructuring that we did in November. We'll give update as we go through the earliest calls on the progress of not only the $50 to $65 in 2018 but where we're tracking but the entire savings under the business transformation initiative.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital. Your line is open.", "Gary Bisbee", "Hey, guys, good evening. Where to start a lot there can be tough to keep it too, but I guess I'll try my best. So the long-term growth target that your - I guess updating from the ones you gave 15 months ago the Investor Day. When do you expect to start to grow obviously you're calling for a declines in 2018. Are those CAGRs calculated based off of what I guess I would suppose the bottom in 2018 and then growing from there. I mean I am just trying to get a sense for visibility into ability deliver this given continued challenge in the phase? Thanks.", "Charles Alutto", "Yes, honestly the CAGR is over the entire business over the five-year period. Certain parts of our business are growing well, CNRS and the Secure Information Destruction Services. We do anticipated as you can see from the revenue tables on the guidance we gave for 2018 we still see a decline in RWCS next year that's obviously continued pressure on this discount in SQ it has some impact as well Gary on the divestiture of the assets. We feel that when we lead a team we will start grow the business from 2019 look forward with certainly we have short-term challenges when we look at the CAGR on the CAGR is over the entire portfolio.", "Daniel Ginnetti", "And Gray as you saw that the graph you'll see the savings in 2018 with a modest saving 2019 and that really does ramp up in 2020 as we begin to implement the European EPM system, you begin to see those savings over our entire shared services as well as some of those it is cared for from me earlier year.", "Gary Bisbee", "And so just to be clear, I guess the follow-up would be around adjusted results. Is there any change and how you are thinking about what you adjusted out to get to those adjusted versus the past in the fourth quarter it seem like there are a couple of things that may be historically you might adjusted out you didn't. And then I want to be clear as part of that you are including the savings from the transformation initiatives, but you're adjusting out the cost that you're facing to deliver those savings? Is that correct?", "Charles Alutto", "Yes, two part question there. I going back one first, that is correct. That the cost $275 million to $300 million will be captured within that it will begin realizing the savings again the majority of which as we've discussed in the frequency and cadence that we just answer the question to.", "The second question has to do really with some of the things that we adjusted from a theme approach. One of the things I hope you saw in the spirit of not just in this business transformation over five years, but in all aspects of our business. We took a holistic approach.", "And really look to improve the press release financial I think you will see a more disclosure in our 10-K as well and so we will be changed down the adjusting items, we're taking more thematic approach with more footnotes and we'll give you more transparency in there and exactly what we're backing out.", "And so you should be able to follow along with us each quarter and each year on what items that we are putting in there. I think you're seeing some good progress on some of these numbers coming down, but certainly with business transformation and capturing it there, you'll see that number to be able to track along with the save.", "Gary Bisbee", "The improvement in the release is definitely noted and we appreciate it quite a bit. Thank you.", "Charles Alutto", "Thank you.", "Operator", "You next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Thanks a lot. And kind of following up on Gary's questions, obviously that you're doubling the EBITDA in the next five years with the business transformation, so I just want to understand what the revenue, I get the CAGR of the revenue provided as well, but what I'm getting to is this before divestitures occur because clearly that's going to happen, and then if you could please elaborate on the sense of urgency with the divestitures? Thank you.", "Charles Alutto", "Yes. So first, this does not contemplate any divestitures beyond what we've already discussed most recently being the divestiture on our Secure Information Destruction business in South Africa. Certainly there is a sense of urgency to look at all aspects of the business transformation and the four pillars that we've discussed.", "And so we will be working diligently. We want to make sure that whatever - in two years whatever service lines or geographies are with us, we are committed to, to make sure that we implement our ERP system and the time and energy it takes to be able to do that over that. And I think - Scott, sorry there was a second part to that question.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Yes. Just on that, and just really on - obviously, you're going to be working towards getting ERP implemented and you want to have these divestitures done before that, I think you just answered that.", "Charles Alutto", "Yes. I think if you look at the criteria we put in there, one of them is the implication towards the ERP, Scott, so one of the non-financial views we'll use in evaluating a service line or geography as we hold on to that asset, how hard that's implemented into the new ERP platform. And certainly that will be one of the criteria that we look at when we make a decision on the rationalization of the portfolio.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Great. Thanks guys. And as my follow-up, just curious on the cadence - quarterly cadence of this 2018 guidance overall and then also if you could slip in at the end, how you think about compliance with the covenants and when you might be at the danger areas on that or actually preach on that? Thanks.", "Charles Alutto", "Sure, as far as cadence, I think the most important number would be to remember the Q1 typically have seasonality build into it and then you see a bit of a recovery in Q2. You have EPS guidance for the year $4.45, $4.85. I think we have to start that is in Q1 to be in a range of $1 to $1.10, and then you take it up ratably thereafter, probably a little bit more than a rational step up in Q2, and then more static going from Q2, Q3, and Q4 in the growth. We'll provide Q2 and further guidance on the next call, coming out in Q1 at $1 to $1.10.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Thanks. And then just touching on the covenants if I could\u2026?", "Charles Alutto", "In covenants, yes, so it's very difficult to tell on that, because obviously the expenses that we have contemplated including the business transformation, some legal fees, these things are very difficult to predict, and so we have modeled this out through the year and we believe that there are points in time, if they come in and certain chunks that we could - we stand that is as reasonably possible that we could exceed them.", "What I would share with you is that as I mentioned we have a very strong relationship with our lenders and we have reached out to the leader arrangers. As you are evaluating this, I would share that it would be appropriate - inappropriate for me to discuss kind of plan, while our company generated very strong free cash flow.", "We paid nearly $500 million in debt over the last two years and we have the ability to service our debt obligation. So we've reached after them. I think we can come up with a plan that is fair that will allow us to continue to invest in the business, more to come on that as we get a little further along with our lenders.", "Daniel Ginnetti", "And I think Scott, just add to that, the other thing is the uncertainty of the $295 million of - actually when that will be paid, there's really no update on that. There is step that have to take, but we just don't know when the $295 million of the legal settlement will actually be paid out.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Thanks, helpful. Appreciate it guys.", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Your line is open.", "David Manthey", "Think you. Guys, maybe you could help me understand Slide 10 in a little more detail? When you say that the gray line is incremental benefit, does that imply that 2019 even though the curve comes down to be greater than $65 million and then just if I look at that overall number, it's $170 million to $200 million annually, I guess the average it. Where would you anticipate hitting that average level and I guess when we hit 2022 you're going to have to be significantly above that. Am I thinking about it correctly?", "Charles Alutto", "I think we will all agree that the graph, is be the gray bar is in year anticipated savings and as we shared with you, with the business - early steps of the business transformation, we expect $60 million to $65 million in 2018, some of which will carry into 2019. But we have some incremental savings opportunity that will have there. The green bar is the cumulative effect and that's why we see that never bending down. It will continue to go up as we enjoy that cumulative benefit, which will be in the range $850 million to $1 billion over the five year period of time.", "Daniel Ginnetti", "And then David, a significant part of the savings comes out the implementation of the ERP and that's why backend loaded. So that's what we see an unleashed efficiency of the back office functions, our operational optimizations. We will get some initiatives in savings before that, but the vast majority comes in after the implemented in 2020.", "David Manthey", "But is that green line in 2022 is that $850 million to $1 billion and the gray line in 2018 is $60 million to $65 million, it just doesn't look like the magnitude anywhere close. I'm just trying to figure out what is so in 2020 you're anticipating a couple $100 million. I just don't understand how to read this graph?", "Charles Alutto", "Yes, I think if you look that and saying 2022 is $250 million of EBITDA as well. The green line is cumulative representation on the savings. But I think that's the best - that's what it first represented cumulative.", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Dave, as would say $65 million, the first year you would see that same $65 million in that year and year after and then as you see an incremental more $19 million you've add to that, and incrementally more and so create that compounded effect.", "David Manthey", "Okay.", "Daniel Ginnetti", "It's not meant to indicate at any point are we getting back any of the savings that we - area.", "David Manthey", "All right that's helpful, thank you. And then as a follow-up, it looks like you're allocating $40 million to $80 million in capital allocation for acquisitions in 2018 that it seems a little bit like changing tires on a moving car here. Why not just stop the M&A program while you fix the organization and pick it up later? I'm just wondering why you'd allocate that especially given your capital challenges you talked about.", "Charles Alutto", "Yes, I'll take that David. I mean certainly our focus is only on small tuck-in acquisitions, this fill up a very good return.", "Daniel Ginnetti", "You're right. We're not going to going after any acquisitions that add complexity of the ERP or there are any of business transformation initiatives or delay them or risk of the time line. But certainly the team can still take in really small tuck-in deals especially in the U.S. in Shred-it or medical waste during some of our more mature international market.", "But that's a much slower amount of we had historically. So I think you see that we have care down on acquisitions with respect especially to the side of the acquisitions and any of the complexity of new service lines.", "Charles Alutto", "Dave, remember also not only everything they chose that - remember that in acquisitions comes with EBITDA as well. So that $8 million is that the dollar amount we end up on and that's not strictly dilutive to EBITDA as it does come up with a transformer to the EBITDA and the opportunity for us to execute on that and generate return that can actually help us delever.", "David Manthey", "All right, thank you.", "Charles Alutto", "Thanks Dave.", "Operator", "You next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Your line is open.", "Michael Hoffman", "Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I have no idea how I'm going to do this unless I ask the multilayered question. So let me start with Slide 10. Can you tell us the absolute numbers for the blue bars, somewhat quite your expectations are\u2026?", "Charles Alutto", "Yes, the blue bar is the costs of the initiative, which is the $275 million to $300 million.", "Michael Hoffman", "Yes, but so what's it in 2017? What's it in 2018? What's it in 2019? What's it in 2020, tell us by year?", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Yes, I think if you look at the guidance that we gave you on a press release that even that on outlook section and you can see that in 2018, we're anticipating about $100 million in spend directly related to the business transformation. In 2017 it was about a quarter of that and really this is meant to be directional, certainly it's going to be delivered based on how we can move on to the next step effectively making sure that we capture everything and we're detailed as possible to make sure the trends the implementation happens according to plan.", "Charles Alutto", "I think if you go back to my prepared remarks. We've intended it obviously front loaded so a majority of it has been 2017, 2018 and 2019 as we prepare for the implementation of the ERP system.", "Michael Hoffman", "So 25 to 175 and then the remaining 75 to 100 spread over the last three years.", "Charles Alutto", "Yes, we'll get back to at the exact rate, but yes, nothing and really that's spend is now by 2021 we fully realize the initiative 2022.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. There is $79 million it rounding delta between how you finished in regulated medical waste versus the midpoint of guidance. And sitting $45 million of that $79 million is SQ price? What's the remaining $33 or $34 million?", "Charles Alutto", "Yes, the $45 million is SQ prices and the majority of the other delta is from the divesture of the patient transport business in the UK and the contracts of the patient transport exist that we had during 2017. The other thing on that Michael was there is a delta on foreign exchange and add something like $12 million headwind in 2018.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sean Dodge from Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Sean Dodge", "Hi, thanks. So may be going back to the portfolio optimization. Charlie can you give us a sense of what at this point you considered to be non-strategic or maybe an idea of how significant or expensive the rationalization could be. I guess would you consider the entirety of M&I do be included there and are you potentially looking at exiting things like com-sol or curtailing a big portion of your international footprint.", "Charles Alutto", "Yes, I think Sean I think at this point I've [indiscernible] not to talk about specific businesses that were in line on what would be core and non-core. I mean certainly let me let me take you through maybe South Africa to give you a little flavor for the decision with respect to the South African divestiture to come as we look at through our Dave an update and what their financial and strategic criteria, but if you look at South Africa it was a limited opportunity to rollout additional services above and beyond.", "Secure Information Destruction included that the business if they continued to grow we did not good growth in South Africa or continue to grow with prior to us have a local equity partner as required by the government regulations and given those factors and all of that given the fact that there was only going to be Secure Information Destruction we decided to divest of that this business.", "I think you think about that patient transport business certainly that would be an easy one to say, hey, that was non-core of the business. For M&I in the UK we won't really creating an link between our operating and function. So we will continue to look at that. We will also going to look at it through the lens, as we said earlier of the implications of the ERP circle if we think it could delay or create risk in the business transformation we would launch to we won't make a decision before we implemented the ERP system.", "Sean Dodge", "Sure. Okay. And then on the 6% to 10% EPS that the long-term growth target there, may be a quick one on the underlying assumptions. Is that range inclusive any benefits you get from deploying the cash you expect to generate over that timeframe I know the guide does any M&A, but does that include debt repayment or any buybacks or any balance sheet kind of driven growth?", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Yes, I think when you look at the long range EPS plan is doesn't include anything with respect to acquisitions. Debt reduction or share repurchase seller and if you look at our guidance for 2018 as we continue to take advantage of the repurchase of the mandatory preferred shares there is $0.17 build in to the 2018 guidance.", "Sean Dodge", "Okay. Understood. Thank you.", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Other beyond using free cash - accelerated free cash for levels are it's not included in that compound annual growth rate.", "Sean Dodge", "All right. Thank you.", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Thanks Sean.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, this is [indiscernible] filling in for Hamzah. Can you give us an update on how medical waste pricing is trending relative to your prior guidance above 130 million headwinds?", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Yes, let me do that Galen for 2017, remember we got is that we'd be at about $45 million SQ discounting amount for the year. We actually came in slightly better than that for the year. We still anticipate the impact to be about $130 million which would imply that, we still have in our guidance about $45 million in SQ discounting in 2018 and an additional $20 million in 2019.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Thanks for that. And then the other - the follow-up question I have is, you mentioned earlier about the highly regulated nature of the business you are in. Can you give us a sense for how that's changing some of the competitive landscape, specifically in the compliance work that you guys do?", "Charles Alutto", "Yes. I think there's been a significant change. Obviously, we work in markets that are highly regulated both for ourselves and our customers and that's the service we sell, which is around compliance and making it easier for our customers to comply. I don't necessarily see the competitive landscaping changing.", "Obviously, we've always been a premium price in the marketplace. We've always said that and that is related to some of the discounting that we're taking down on our SQ business. I think that has a lot of factors there, so our place in the marketplace it's pressures in health care consolidation in the health care market.", "So I think that has changed, no necessarily if the competitive market has changed. I think when you think about our hazardous waste or M&I business, I think that has gotten more competitive. I think when we think about M&I, we see it especially in the project and large customer volume accounts.", "And I think that has to do with some extra capacity that's in the marketplace now. I think for us, the long-term M&I means a shift or pivot to more smaller medium customers, where I think our services provides greater value and convenience, so I do see - that has been more competitive and I think there has been a change in the market, but I think that's what we're seeing in the M&I business.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Thanks Charlie.", "Charles Alutto", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kevin Steinke with Barrington Research. Your line is open.", "Kevin Steinke", "Good afternoon. So of that $275 million to $300 million of total investment in the business transformation, are you able to share how much of that is specifically for the ERP system implementation? And then I don't know if you could share the system you chose and who the integrator is going to be?", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Yes. In fact thank you for asking that because it allowed me to hop back on a number of questions that were out there. So first of all, the $300 million that we put out, $275 million to $300 million. I want to share that about a third of that is for capital expenditures.", "And so that's directly in response to Dave's question about what goes to these adjusting items on that and the team that we have for business transformation. The capital will never show up. There the capital will go into CapEx once it begins to be depreciated, I mean the assets is being utilized and that will never show up in the adjusting now just in our results.", "The spend that we have on there will be - this is really to Michael, the first year in 2017, we had about $42 million, you talked about $30 million. That was consulted type work and about $11 million of that was CapEx. You should expect about $115 million or so in 2019, $90 million to $100 million say in 2019 and then moving down beyond that.", "And Kevin, answer to your question, about $175 million to about $200 million of that is directly related to the ERP. We did select to go with SAP, the latest S-4 HANA platform, which is cloud based. As far as system integrator, we are in the final stages of negotiation and so I thought we could share that to you at about a week or two, but unfortunately not today.", "Kevin Steinke", "Okay. No problem. That's very helpful. And following up on the $25 million of added SQ investments in 2018, I was curious about the one component which is the dedicated account managers and wondering if you see the potential there to maybe alleviate some pricing pressure by strengthening those relationships and just simply better educating customers about all the offerings that they currently have with Stericycle and making sure they use them appropriately. So maybe that helps alleviate pricing pressure and then maybe also does it help you on your cross-selling to the SQ customer base?", "Charles Alutto", "Kevin, it sounds like you were in the meeting. You're exactly right. As you're very familiar with, we've got account managers in our hospital sales group, our regional and national accounts groups, our Shred-it groups that model works very effectively across a lot of pieces of our business and just like you said the goal of that account manager is to serve as the trusted advisor and that one single point of contact with the customer and really by doing that it allows us to build relationships with the customer better understand their needs, which enabled us to match their needs with our compliance services.", "So traditionally with our up-sell and cross-sell has been more of a transactional model. And so we're making this shift - not in all areas, but in more areas within SQ. And again our pilot show that it helps reduce churn. It helped reduce discounting and it really created a platform for up-sell.", "The challenge is, it takes time, right. It takes time to build those relationships and in that interim period you have higher expenses as well as left up-sell to that subset of customers. So again we're very excited about the long-term potential. I think you're right on with the benefits we see at the same way. It's just a matter of it will take time for us to get there.", "Kevin Steinke", "Okay, thanks for taking the questions.", "Charles Alutto", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Isaac Ro", "Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I want to start briefly with a question around the current business environment. The prior questions touch a little bit on what's going on in regulated ways and I'm curious as the settlement notices have gone out has there been anything surprising that would indicate kind of how you think customers will behave with regard to future contracting over the course of the year? And I'm kind of curious what's baked into your outlook for 2018 guidance on that specific topic?", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Yes, so as you alluded to, the notifications went out. They went out over in November and December that period actually is passed and now the time period is passed, the class members to opt out and object the settlement. So we did not see anything noticeable in call volume or discounting.", "As I said before, we actually did a little slightly better than we had forecasted on the $45 million of discounting in 2017, as far as what do we do with that information as we go forward into 2018. We still think we'll have discounting and that hasn't change our view of $130 million has not changed and we have obviously in our guidance $45 million in discounting.", "In the plan with respect to the next step, the next time would be that when the checks go out, we could get an increase in calls and see in the guidance range obviously included in the guidance range is both upside and downside to SQ performance. I think it's really important to note however, with the settlement, with the notifications going on, even with checks going out that our contractor remain in fact. So far - as far as the direct question or notifications we didn't see any major impact there.", "Isaac Ro", "That's helpful. And then just a clarification on the guidance you provided in the slides, the 3% to 5% revenue CAGR over five years is that meant to be an organic number or does it include some M&A and if so how much and I think you guys said on the slide that the FX that you're guiding to was effective of current rates, but then I think in a slide that also said maybe if I could December 31. So please clarify what exchange rate you're using for that guidance? Thank you.", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Yes, so the CAGR on growth does not include any acquisitions. It's organic growth and we're using current as of today with respect to foreign exchange.", "Isaac Ro", "Got it, thank you guys.", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Thanks Isaac.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Your line is open.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay, I'll ask this question, the last quarter if you take out SQ year-over-year in the fourth quarter? What was the underlying growth in the rest of to make it medical waste?", "Charles Alutto", "We didn't - let me give you this number Michael. It's difficult to result of the puts and takes on the SQ business. When we exclude the patient transfer divestiture, the RWCS grew at a negative 0.5, we not to get back to you with the SQ out of the business.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay, so that's okay.", "Charles Alutto", "So just over we're clear and comparing, I just want to make sure that you have the right number. If you look at the RWCS rents for the quarter, Q4 organic growth rate was the negative 2.3%. But in that number you had patient transport exits and divestiture, if you move to that which is an easy account to do it. It was negative 0.5% organic growth.", "Michael Hoffman", "Right. So you gave us a 4% growth number in 3Q for that - the same answer to the - the answer to the same questions, so can you get back to us on that?", "Charles Alutto", "Yes. We will get back to you on that.", "Daniel Ginnetti", "We'll get back to you on that Michael. I'm sorry we did not\u2026", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. And then I got two more Charlie, don't ask\u2026", "Charles Alutto", "No, it's fine.", "Michael Hoffman", "So what is your assumption of FX, since you said it was $12 million in RMW, what's it for the whole revenue number for FX year-over-year for 2018?", "Daniel Ginnetti", "The impact in 2018 is $16 million of FX total business and $12 million which is in regulated waste and compliance services, $6 million in M&I, and then we have $2 million favorable that happens in our Secure Information Destruction.", "Charles Alutto", "It's depending on where there are in the world exactly.", "Michael Hoffman", "Yes. Okay. And then you have a slide that shows the water fall off what we thought 2018 was going to be based on being flat and then you did the progressions. I would like to go the other way which is you thought 2017 was going to be 835, it comes out at 812, so what makes up the $23 million miss, what are we dealing over there?", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Yes. I will take you through that, Michael and that's really kind of bridging to where we thought that we would be in EPS for Q4 compared to the - our EBITDA I think is what you are asking for.", "Michael Hoffman", "Yes.", "Daniel Ginnetti", "So initially thought Michael that Q4 adjusted EBITDA will be about 20.8%. We did already speak to you about the catch up and acceleration of the non-cash related to depreciation and also some control remediation work that we did. That itself was a combined 285 basis points headwind. You remember the vast majority of that Michael will not repeat. We saw some cost pressures in Europe including the last of the stranded patient transportation.", "That was about 45 basis points of headwind. And we had 55 basis points for the SCS business from cost to install a new large LQ contract, some higher fuel and energy and that mix of LQ to SQ, and then we saw 15 basis point of favorability from the solid build out and results of GNRs. That got you to 17.1% EBITA. Remember, I'm going to talk to you regarding Q4 and EBITA and then as I'm giving you guidance going forward and next year we will be speaking about EBITDA going forward.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay. And then lastly, in the current guidance of 760 to 810 that assumes $65 million of benefit from all those work you are doing.", "Daniel Ginnetti", "It does Michael, and I know - I want to share with you, remember there is some headwinds in the business that a lot of that's going to get absorbed in and it was contemplated in the kinds of directional guidance that we gave in Q3. One of which is, as you know we underperformed in 2017 and we ended that not paying bonuses. So you do have the bonuses comp going back in, $65 million is an offset there. We've already - once you know that we expected 2019 to have a continuation of - sorry 2018, you have the continuation of SQ pricing impact, and then on top of that we now have a few of the other items that we broke out in that waterfall table.", "Michael Hoffman", "Okay, thank you.", "Charles Alutto", "Thanks.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital. Your line is open.", "Gary Bisbee", "Hey just I wanted to ask a follow-up. Can you give us any more detail on what - where exactly the $60 million to $65 million efficiency this year comes from. What are the categories there? What are the key items that are driving?", "Daniel Ginnetti", "Yes, I think if you look at the pillars that we talked about, if you go back to pillars of the slide that we talked about Gary in the presentation, you got operational optimization commercial excellence, org excellence and sourcing. If I rank them in the order of the number one, please we're getting efficiency that $60 million to $65 million was operation optimization.", "That will be organizational excellence, which we already executed on that was restructuring that we did in November, and then we'll see some come through sourcing and commercial excellence. But the two are operational optimization obviously getting efficiencies in our operations and the organizational restructuring that we concluded in November.", "Gary Bisbee", "And Charlie just you did mention I think compliance, IT you said a couple places there was some hiring to support doing what you're going after. But can you give us any more color there? Is there a need for a much deeper bench in a number of various - is there a need for I guess relative to SAP, there is a need for extensive help on the integration front. But how does the ongoing sort of G&A or corporate headcount need to change to accomplish?", "Charles Alutto", "Yes, I think you've seen it over the course of the last year, I mean if you think about it between the Chief Accounting Officer, the CIO that we brought in, the new General Counsel that we bought into the business. The investments we made in business transformation in a dedicated team there. We've been building in that bench frame. I mean obviously, it's now in the full run rate of the business, but we've been building that over the last 12 to 18 months.", "You're right about SAP, but I will tell you that our CIO has been through ERP implementations before and we've already build a fairly significant internal team, augment obviously without the resources that have not only SAP experience, but SAP conversion experience. So it's been building and I think you've seen it over the last 12 months obviously though now it's in the business.", "Daniel Ginnetti", "And we've considered that in our 2018 guidance and, above and beyond what's Charlie shared here, taking a look at really bringing in talent today that can think about what a true global shared service end-to-end process look like. And brining that expertise, they can help us certain blueprinting system that will free us up to have a lot of opportunities for saving down the road.", "And so those investments and people are contemplated in our 2018 plan and so I don't anticipate seeing any surprises in SG&A investments and team members because like we've thoroughly consider that.", "Gary Bisbee", "Thank you, guys. That's helpful.", "Charles Alutto", "Thanks Gary.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks.", "Charles Alutto", "Thanks Jesse. In closing I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on today's call and have a great evening. We'll see on the road soon. Take care.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call you may now disconnect.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.
